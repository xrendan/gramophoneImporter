Artists inevitably became involved, either as soldiers at the front or as composers of patriotic music or musical memorials to a lost world. The three-part documentary series investigates the (un)known, overt and hidden connections between music, power, war and revolution. Beginning with what led to this great human tragedy, each episode addresses different perspectives of the relationship between music and politics. While Parts One and Two explore both the hopeful and subsequently tragic entanglements of art and politics to which so many artists fell victim during the First World War and the October Revolution, Part Three embarks on a search for the political aspects of music up to this day. Featuring Daniel Barenboim, Valery Gergiev, Ivan Fisher, Pierre-Laurent Aimard, Steffen Schleiermacher, Julia Sophie Wagner, Vladimir Stoupel, and many more, this release is a production of Accentus Music in co-production with WDR, in co-operation with Arte and supported by Mitteldeutsche Medienförderung.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=ACC20473&medium=phy,DVD/Bluray,DVD/Bluray,,EU,,2018 Accentus Music,78 Documentaries,8,Andreas Morell; Anne-Kathrin Peitz; Isa Willinger; Julia Sophie Wagner; Maria Stodtmeier; Steffen Schleiermacher,Andreas Morell,2,,2018 Accentus Music,DE,NR,NTSC,0,DVD-9,German; English; Russian,"German, English, French, Japanese, Korean",PCM Stereo,Color,16:9,166,2018,

The program is anchored by the Mozart Requiem and also features festive works of Bach's Reformation Cantata, Ein feste Burg, because 2018 also marked the 500th anniversary of the Lutheran Reformation. While it is more common to hear these works performed by larger ensembles, this historically-informed performance honors the repertoire's intimacy by only employing 32 voices and a similarly sized orchestra. All three pieces on this album were touched by hands beyond those of their composers. While many purists have worked extensively to cleanse iconic works of foreign elements, this performance embraces them. Bach's Ein feste Burg proudly features the extra parts for three trumpets and timpani added by his son, Wilhelm Friedemann Bach. Haydn's Te Deum was written for Empress Marie Theresa even though he was employed to write music for the Esterhazy court in Eisenstadt. Even though the complete autograph is lost, trombone parts were later discovered to have been written in the hand of his copyist, Johann Elssler. So, it is probable that Haydn delivered a large-scale work including three trombones and three trumpets to the Empress, even though he performed a slightly down-sized version of the same work in Eisenstadt to accommodate the orchestral forces available to him. This recording boasts all extant parts. Finally and most famously, Mozart's Requiem was completed by Süssmayr following his death in 1791. This album honors a perspective in which early music is still a living art that is capable of change and worthy of exploration.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=AF1810&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Choral,United States,2018 Affetto Records,2018 Affetto Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I added these new treasures to my percussion set, not realizing that these newbies arranged among my cymbals would eventually become an instrument in their own right... Totally unlike church bells, whose pitches are pre-calculated when casting them, the pitch of cowbells is only approximate. The low-pitched bells are called "dull", and the high-pitched ones "bright" - you need only a few cowbell notes to identify a particular herd.

Inaccessible for many decades to specialists and scholars, La Doriclea is definitely the least known of all Stradella's operas. However, it constitutes a particularly significant chapter in his overall output: composed in Rome during the early 1670s, to our knowledge La Doriclea represents the first opera entirely composed by Stradella. From the dramatic point of view, La Doriclea belongs to the comedy of intrigue genre typical of the 17th century Spanish theatre tradition. Refined and amusing, it alternates touching lamentos with irresistibly comic scenes, in which the character of Giraldo, a veritable precursor of the basso buffo, allows us to glimpse Rossinian atmospheres. Emoke Baráth (Doriclea) and Xavier Sabata (Fidalbo) alongside Giuseppina Bridelli (Lucinda) and Luca Cervoni (Celindo) and the comic couple of Delfina (Gabriella Martellacci) and Giraldo (Riccardo Novaro) bring a complex and fascinating role-playing game to life.

This was first of all the case with the programme Blues Everywhere I Go that took us into the heart of the Mississippi Delta; today she offers us a new project: The Road to Freedom. The songs of blues and gospel have played a highly important role in accompanying and inspiring the courageous activists who have struggled for civil rights in the USA, a struggle led by Martin Luther King in the 1950's and 1960's. The emotional power of these songs, and the example of the activists' conviction are more than ever necessary to help us confront the complexities and contradictions of today's world, one too often based on division and hatred, and not enough on love and that solidarity to which Dr. King was always referring.

When the 100-year-celebration of Zimmermann's birth came around, we remembered the impression they had made upon us. When we finally got to see the entire score, however, we took a deep breath: it demands the most incredible acrobatic feats! From the very beginning, we were particularly charmed by the way Zimmermann cites other composers: the quoted passages rise up in the midst of an agitated storm, like islands of tranquility and beauty. The works quoted by Zimmermann are not for piano duo, but we find that they have certain parallels with the other pieces on this recording. The cocky, unpredictable, whimsical aspect of Mozart's C Major Sonata is also present in Zimmermann. It is fascinating to note how he quotes Debussy's prelude Feux d'artifice in the 4th and 5th Monologues, thereby transplanting that shimmering French flair into his own musical environment. Debussy, for Zimmermann, is more than just a source for quotes. The frothy, pastel sonorities in the Monologues are so untypically German, so much more beautifully poetic than anywhere else, except in Debussy."",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=AVI%208553406&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Germany,"2018 Avi-Service for music, Cologne/Germany",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nothing has changed in his attitude since then. Fabian Müller has embarked on a promising career which has already been full of thrills and continues to progress very favorably. In 2017 he was the first German pianist in this millennium to win a second prize at the ARD Music Competition as well as being awarded both the Audience and Busch prizes. He gave his debut at New York's Carnegie Hall in the spring of 2018, and at the Elbphilharmonie in Hamburg in September that year. The Bonn-born pianist demonstrates Brahms's calm, introverted pianistic approach in his recordings of the Ballades op. 10, the Piano Pieces op. 76 and the Intermezzi op. 117. This is an unusual choice for such a young artist: Müller's playing style eschews sensational pianistic virtuosity, instead evincing heartfelt musicality, especially in the soft tones. In "piano expert" Stefan Knüpfer, who is known from the film Pianomania, he has found the perfect technical partner, who knew exactly how to react to his ideas and wishes. The result is a sound that is almost inimitable. On his debut album for Berlin Classics he can be heard inviting listeners to totally immerse themselves in the music.

And when one of Germany's most renowned trumpet virtuosos speaks of concentrated sound, then you can be sure he means a really phenomenal sound. Matthias Höfs has brought together current and former students from his trumpet class at the Hamburg Music College for this project. This gathering of colleagues, companions and friends who play for a number of the big German orchestras, make this album into something of a student reunion. Matthias Höfs thrills audiences, both alone and in various ensembles, playing works that are rarely given a hearing: be it Janácek's Sokol Fanfare from the Sinfonietta, Strauss's Festival Music for the City of Vienna (featuring 10 trumpets, 7 trombones, 2 tubas and timpani), two fanfares by Stravinsky or the Sinfonia & Caprice by the Japanese composer Itaru Sakai. The central focus is on Wolf Kerschek's ""The Trumpets Shall Sound"" for solo trumpet, nine trumpets and orchestra - a large-scale work which Kerschek, who is most at home in the fields of jazz and film music, wrote specially for Matthias Höfs. ""What work calls for so many trumpets? As a composer, I had to come up with something special,"" says the composer, who also teaches at the College of Music and Drama in Hamburg. That is why his composition features a whole raft of different influences and approaches to the instrument. From trumpet signals and fanfares from a military context, echoes of ethereal, celestial heavenly realms and the trumpets of Judgment Day that brought down the walls of Jericho - all of them intellectual points of departure for the composer who has found in Matthias Höfs the perfect musical partner.",bit.ly/hoefs_kindofgold_yt,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=0301129BC&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Germany,2081 Edel Germany GmbH,2081 Edel Germany GmbH,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The score, bought by Ricordi, started making the rounds right away and in a few years there was no Italian theatre which had not staged at least one edition. What did the public find in this opera? A kind of melodic idea, certainly not banal and often adequate and incisive, an insistent rhythm and a logical, feverish narrative movement. There was certainly a clear subjection to Verdi's expressive form; the score is entirely entrusted to the singing: the recitatives are short and the composer rarely makes use of declamatory or arioso parts.

It was Schubert's tenth opera, but it was the second and last one performed during his life. As writing for the theatre had been his greatest wish for some time, Schubert accepted with satisfaction the invitation to compose the music for the Magic Harp, even if he received it only two weeks before the staging of the opera. But, though it may seem inexplicable, it isn't an occasional page scribbled down quickly in order not to lose an engagement, but it is an opera quite new in the context in which it is placed, that Schubert wrote after various reflections as we can see from the drafts and preparatory materials left to us. In fact with this opera Schubert hoped to win the favor of the audience and of the Viennese managers who had completely ignored him till then; but it didn't happen, as after a run of seven nights the opera vanished from the re­pertory and from the memory of the posterity: more than a century and a half had to pass before it was revived in Berlin (1978), Kassel (1982) and Bologna (1983).

The sound and style of this music are somewhere between western contemporary and eastern traditional music, creating a unique fusion of musical and aesthetic elements. The piano songs are complemented with an epic piece for classical guitar solo by Ifukube, played by the Dutch guitarist David van Ooijen. Akira Ifukube was born in 1914 in Kushiro Japan. He was strongly influenced by the Ainu music, as he spent his childhood in Otofuke, where there lived a mixed population of Ainu and Japanese people. He decided to become a composer at the age of 14 after hearing a radio performance of Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring. He worked as a forestry officer until the end of the Second World War, when he suffered radiation exposure and had to abandon forestry work and become a professional composer and teacher.

Instead, the coupling is very clever since Prokofiev's First Violin Concerto, whose premiere was in 1923 (while the composer was still living in France, a few years before his return to Soviet Union) served as a much-admired model to Walton's Viola Concerto, whose first performance was played by Paul Hindemith in 1929. The similarities between the two works go beyond the three-movement structure slow-quick-slow and concern themes, accompaniments and the rondo form of the virtuoso central Scherzo. The smart idea of such unusual coupling came to one of the few great living violinists who can really play the viola with equal skill: Isabelle van Keulen. This glorious album is crowned by the orchestrated version of Vaughan Williams' masterpiece The Lark Ascending.

That, combined with our love for Schubert's music, sparked the desire to musically arrange and finally discover Schubert's world, not only as listeners, but as performers. We started out by arranging Moments Musicaux. It was with delight that we realized how well these pieces work for guitar: the intimacy, serenity and folklore in Schubert's piano music, so to speak, lived within the character of the guitar- and in order to move even closer into his world, we decided to play copies of guitars from Schubert's time, with the very sound quality Schubert would have heard in the Viennese musical circles." Elisabeth Leonskaja commented after hearing the duo: "Recently I experienced a magical moment of music: two fine musicians- Christian Fergo and Raoul Morat- playing Schubert on two guitars. I felt transported back to the time of Schubert and thought I was hearing pianos from his epoch.

The matury of Elgar as an orchestrator is obvious in both works on this album, notably, in 'The Music Makers' (1912), during passages in which he quotes from 'Sea Pictures' and the Violin Concerto, and in representing the sound of aircraft in 'The Spirit of England' (1917). Elgar uses self-quotation to reflect: 'The Music Makers' is a canvas of self-reflection, written quickly following a period of illness. The orchestral introduction is introspective, melancholic, and noble, before the words of Arthur O'Shaughanessy's poem and much self-quotation within the music offer an insight into the sense of nostalgia and awareness of the loneliness of the creative artist felt by the composer. 'The Spirit of England' reflects on the sadness and desolation of war felt by a nation, with the inclusion of quotations from 'The Dream of Gerontius' in some of the more negative stanzas that Elgar found harder to set.

Scriabin finished his piano concerto in only a few days, although it took months to orchestrate it before the 1897 premiere.

It was a strange thing to say given that Copland had already composed a variety of symphonies, albeit admittedly all more experimental than Barber might have preferred. The fourth volume in the highly acclaimed Copland series from John Wilson and the BBC Philharmonic opens with the resoundingly successful Symphony No. 3 (1944-46). The optimistic spirit of this work resonated perfectly with the euphoria of post-war America, resulting in its becoming an emblem of US nationalism. This lesser-recorded original version comes complete with the twelve bars which Bernstein later suggested cutting from the fourth movement. Three commissions complement the symphony: 'Letter from Home' (1944) reflects the feelings of receiving a letter from a loved on.

The consecutive Kochel numbers of the three piano works hint at a remarkable story: not only were they all written in the same extraordinarily productive year, but all were completed in the same month, March, when Mozart was just twenty-eight years old. The two concertos form a pair, and in letters to his father Mozart makes it clear that he wrote them for his own performance: "Nobody but I owns these new concertos in B flat and D," adding in another letter, two weeks later, "I consider them both to be concertos which make one sweat."

Each reflects characteristics of a different month, the style is simple, the mood introspective.

A new groove set off, sparked by the pizzicato violin of Max Baillie, then my 5-note riff on the keyboard. Sam came in with his version of Rambling Boys, and a touching performance emerged - and this album was born. We decided to go into the studio, switch on the red light and see if we could repeat this spontaneous process, starting with Rambling Boys and the theme of 'journeys to the other side'. Once more, this was almost entirely improvised, the band set off with grooves and textures and Sam added melodies. I steered the band into different areas, looping some music, isolating ideas then bouncing off from them into other directions, spending extended times getting absorbed in an idea. I have edited this six hours of adventures into the nine tracks for this album. The extraordinary backgrounds and flexibility of the band - classical, jazz, folk, Scottish music - enable us to draw on our experiences of music of the past as well as today, and then we search for a new music born of what each person brings into that studio - just like the club nights at Club Inégales."",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=CI003&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Jazz|Contemporary Jazz,United Kingdom,2018 Sam Lee & Peter Wiegold,2018 Club Inegales Label,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"We did not want to be as blatant as we used to be," saxophonist Christoph Irniger described the surprisingly multi-faceted development process of the trio documented in nine songs. If he, bassist Marco Blochlinger and drummer Chrigel Bosshard did it the hard way in the past, then that meant: "Wild at any price, complicated and full of biting humor. Of course, these are all things that still have a certain value for us. But in the meantime, we do not have to show that we can play really difficult stuff...

Daughter of Orazio Gentileschi, Artemisia was only remembered, until a few decades ago, for the scandal of the rape trial - filed against Agostino Tassi, one of her father's artistic partners, who raped her when she was seventeen - she had to wait over three hundred years to see her value as a painter fully recognized. The music is played by Accademia d'Arcadia, 13 musicians with period instruments and a singer. The 13 pieces performed correspond to 13 famous paintings of Artemisia. A full color booklet shows the 13 paintings with detailed info and texts, an interesting idea for a great emotional impact. An excellent lutenist, and fond of music, Artemisia Gentileschi had relationships with many famous musicians of her time. This program follows Artemisia's life through her stays in the major Italian cities (Rome, Florence, Venice and Naples) and features pieces by composers who were working in those cities in the same years.

The Five Tango Sensations were originally written for Lutz Mommartz's experimental film Tango durch Deutschland. In 1989, Piazzolla resurrected five of the original seven pieces in response to a commission from the Kronos Quartet, renaming them Five Tango Sensations. This work occupies a special place in the ocean of Astor Piazzolla's music for two reasons: it is his only suite for bandoneon and string quartet, and it departs from the standard Piazzollian framework in both form and language. The suite Les Hommes de Piaf was originally a series of arrangements for string quartet and bandoneon based on tunes from the repertoire of Edith Piaf. But the composer's pen trumped the arranger's, imposing a texture in which the songs no longer play the leading role. Neither descriptive nor abstract, the suite Les Hommes de Piaf is merely a fantasised expression of states in which love can be by turns paradoxical, destructive, idealised, impossible or sensory, through a kaleidoscopic 'Piaf filter'.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=FUG609&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Modern Era,Netherlands,2018 Negracha Productions,2018 Outhere Music,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is the original Florentine 1847 version of the work, shorn of the Paris revisions more typically found on record, which Fabio Biondi has opted to conduct, the director believing in its greater dramatic and stylistic coherence. Verdi was of the opinion that the Shakespearean tragedy was "one of the greatest creations of the human spirit" and set himself the task of rendering the fire of its drama into music during and following a period when his physical health had broken down. With its scenes of murder, battle and sleep-walking, brindisi and witches' choruses all creating a somber atmosphere drenched with paranoia and a lust for power, the dramatic flow of the opera places vast demands on the soloists, notably upon the unhappy title-role couple. Fabio Biondi's version comes with baritone Giovanni Meoni, a leading Verdi specialist as Macbeth whilst the larger-than-life role of Lady Macbeth is taken by a noted present-day Salome, Médée (and Medea), the soprano Nadja Michael. Bass Fabrizio Beggi assumes the part of Banquo, both when alive and as a ghost. Important also in the work is the chorus, a leading protagonist for the composer, and here the Podlasie Opera and Philharmonic Choir. Critical also is Verdi's orchestral writing for Macbeth, introducing rare and radical tonal colorings and Fabio Biondi, directing his Europa Galante from the violin, is just the radical, challenging musical spirit to breathe new life into Verdi's masterpiece and its search for dramatic truth.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=GCD923411&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Austria,2018 Note 1 Music,2018 Note 1 Music,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

His First Symphony was, according to Manfred Huss, written in Lukavec Castle near Pilsen in 1759. This is where Haydn served his second aristocratic employer (after Baron Fürnberg): Count Ferdinand Maximilian Franz Morzin. Haydn had a small orchestra of 15 to 17 musicians at his disposal there and wrote his early symphonies for them. The First Symphony is also the first to be listed in the catalogue of the Dutch musicologist Anthony van Hoboken (1887-1983, hence the abbreviation Hob.); however, the lack of accurate evidence made it difficult even for this great Haydn scholar to determine the chronological sequence of the remaining symphonies.

This attractive but difficult quest has unfortunately been marked by a lack of the necessary care, not to mention purely artistic deficiencies, so that none of the releases deserves the name "complete recording". Since Schumann published several works in two more or less different versions, it is not legitimate in a "complete recording" to include only one of the versions, let alone to amalgamate two of them. Moreover, works published at remote places as well as unpublished works and fragments that could easily be completed without too much speculation, have so far been taken into account only in exceptional cases. Florian Uhlig's 15-album set is the first genuine complete recording of Robert Schumann's works for solo piano. On albums sensibly concentrating on different themes, the pianist for the first time attempts to present all the original piano works between 1830 (Abegg Variations op. 1) and 1854 (Theme and Variations in E flat Major), using the latest critical editions and/or first editions. Several of those releases include first recordings. The introductory notes written by Joachim Draheim, who has discovered and/or edited a number of the works, throw light on the biographical and historical backgrounds of the respective groups of works.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=HC17038&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Germany,2018 haenssler classic; Profil Medien GmbH,2018 haenssler classic; Profil Medien GmbH,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This release is the culmination of a three-year project that included collaborative development residencies, workshops, performances, and recordings scattered between Huddersfield, Canada, Scotland, and Norway. The three compositions presented on Bozzini+ represent diverse aesthetic approaches and working methods. Bryn Harrison's Piano Quintet features rapid, tangled, filigree cycles and not-quite-repeating loops across its nearly hour-long duration, particularly through its dense, intricate piano writing. Continuing Harrison's interest in the role of memory in our temporal perception of music, these cycles are more varied than in his previous work - they are layered and intertwined, presented forwards, backwards, often at the same time or at subtly slower or faster rates to produce a multi-dimensional view of time passing. Mary Bellamy's 'beneath an ocean of air' draws its inspiration from the artwork of James Turrell, and specifically his Deer Shelter Skyspace from the Yorkshire Sculpture Park. Bellamy creates a musical analogue that replicates the experience of light and air inside of Turrell's sculpture through high, untethered whistles, flickers, wisps and slides, created through a collection of novel performance reworking of instrumental material composed for Summers and the Bozzini Quartet inspired by the Norwegian landscape where Summers lives as well as the Scottish and Norwegian folk traditions she blends in her work. Adkins takes these audio documents as a starting point and reuses, alters, effaces, and obfuscates the original material, extending freezing and stretching it into a texture that becomes suspended, glacial, and timeless.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=HCR19CD&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,,2018 University of Huddersfield,2018 University of Huddersfield,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At that time he had spent five years in Vienna, and the aristocratic circles were beginning to recognize his extraordinary genius. He gave solo piano recitals, worked as a conductor on a regular basis, rehearsed his own compositions, received private students, and was involved in the social life of the imperial capital. Two years later Mozart added three new grandiose piano trios to the repertory of the chamber music genre. They are preceded by two pieces: the first is one of the composer's early chamber works, followed by a piece compiled by Abbé Stadler from various musical fragments and entitled Three movements for piano trio.

His work springs out of the centuries long tradition of classical art songs and epitomizes the composer's life-long fascination with the intersection between words and music. About his many settings of poetry to music, Grill writes that "dating back into pre-history, poets and musicians have always been the ones to lift humanity up from the mundane and connect us with the deepest part of ourselves. I have always found the connection between words that go beyond words and music to be an inspiration. My favorite poets write words that seem to sing off the page and so setting their words to music is a necessary and natural response." In this album, the words and notes on the page spring into life with the commanding artistry of soprano Nancy Allen Lundy, pianist Stephen Gosling, and violinist Ralph Farris. Raised in New York City, Stanley Grill has spent a lifetime composing music as an act of translation, trying to understand the world and convey that understanding in musical terms.

Time appears frozen, restructured, and propelled forward by applying esoteric workings to the birth dates of performers, musical visionaries, and dates of political events. But the effect on the listener is to entangle them joyfully in vigorous syncopations of vibrant musical material. In the title track, 'Soul Doctrine,' a pulsating piano pushes the distorted electric guitar and fiery flute into a powerful and emotional journey consisting of dynamic turns and colorful collisions inspired by the sixteenth century music of the Reformation and Counter-Reformation. The rich sound world of 'Silent Crackdown' reflects the tragic events of the 228 Incident in Taiwan and the compelling music played at Taiwanese funerals to awaken the dead. In Flute Soldier, a magic square from 1514 provides for a percussive palette of punchy melodic loops.

All-purpose term for a person, place or thing. Sure, Christian McBride could have called his new ensemble the Christian McBride Quartet or the Christian McBride Group, or any number of other, somewhat more straitlaced variations on that basic theme. But this new chordless quartet - with trumpeter Josh Evans, saxophonist Marcus Strickland, and drummer Nasheet Waits - arrives with a bit too much grit under its fingernails to warrant a name quite that buttoned up. If there's one thing the acclaimed bassist knows, it's that when it comes to grit there's no better resource to draw from than his own hometown, Philadelphia. So, McBride turned to one of the city's most beloved colloquialisms to christen his latest project, Christian McBride's New Jawn. On the band's eponymous debut, these four stellar musicians ably walk the razor's edge between thrilling virtuosity and gut-punch instinctiveness. "I was looking for a new challenge," says McBride of the birth of the New Jawn. "I don't get the chance too often to play in a chordless group. Every major group I've been a part of for the last ten years, whether it's been with Pat Metheny or Chick Corea or my own projects, there's been nothing but chords. So, I wanted to see what happens if I just pull the chords out altogether." The result is a surprisingly bracing and adventurous outing for McBride.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=MAC1133LP&medium=phy,02 Jazz,Jazz,,United States,2018 Mack Avenue Records,2018 Mack Avenue Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the last few years he has toured around the world as a bandleader and recently appeared as a sideman on records by Christian McBride and Gregory Porter. After the one-two punch of Reach and Reach Further - EP, Sands' dynamic 2017 Mack Avenue debut and his live/unreleased studio tracks EP follow-up released earlier this year, Facing Dragons is Sands' return to the recording studio with an indestructible band and an unwavering allegiance to the groove. ""I like the freedom of the trio format,"" says Sands. ""It's more dramatic to me. It's a smaller entity but with a big personality. I can fit it into different situations dynamically, compositionally."" The opening track ""Rebel Music"" features Sands' wide-ranging scope at its most elegant, nimbly jetting through single unison lines and bright block chords. Here and throughout the record he is joined by bassist Yasushi Nakamura and drummer Jerome Jennings, the band that Sands has been relentlessly touring with. The two sensitive accompanists are locked in sync, joined occasionally by a powerhouse pair of horns, a sinewy guitarist and a fiery pair of percussionists. Saxophonist Marcus Strickland strikes first on the hard swinging "Fight For Freedom," unleashing a throaty cry over the churning band. "Marcus Strickland brings a certain fire to the band," says Sands. Trumpeter Keyon Harrold shares the frontline with Strickland, playing in effortless harmony on the melody before getting a little solo space near the tune's close. Throughout the rest of the album Sands evokes a spectral world without borders, drifting off like a satellite towards the next adventure. "Like all of my albums, I want people to feel connected through a story that I'm telling.

The album is named after the period of time between the late 19th and early 20th centuries in France when science, arts and economy were remarkably flourishing in Paris. The Exposition Universelle held in 1900 with previously unseen splendor and scope attracted millions of visitors. However, the Paris salons were the major points of attraction - the most serious issues of life and arts, literary and artistic novelties were discussed there. And, music played the central part in that special environment. The poetry of Charles Baudelaire and Paul Verlaine breathes music. Music inspired Marcel Proust's prose. But it is impossible to recreate the true picture of the era without recollecting the music itself. Many once-famous names found themselves in the shadow of the great innovator contemporaries. Ludmila Berlinskaya and Arthur Ancelle, who have successfully performed together for many years, offer a fascinating musical tour of Paris, the city that was a true capital of European civilization in those years. The piano duet presents music of the Beautiful Era written by French composers - Cécile Chaminade, Charles Koechlin, Louis Aubert and Reynaldo Hahn. These names are now little known to listeners outside of France, but their music was used to create that unique atmosphere of the Paris salons. Claude Debussy's suite En blanc et noir (1915) concludes the album.

His music is difficult to ascribe to a certain style and school. Being neither government-favored nor dissident, without cashing in on "socialist realism", he never flirted with avant-garde. Yuiri Butsko showed his worth in different genres - opera, symphony, choral and chamber music. This set features works reflecting the diversity of the composer's palette and simultaneously the evolution of his artistic way. The opera Diary of a Madman (1964), one of Butsko's early works, is still among his most popular ones. When he still was a sophomore student of the conservatory, he managed to feel the tragic eccentricity of Gogol's text so keenly that his mono-opera, which was sharply criticized by the establishment when it saw light of the day, became a classic of Soviet art during the composer's lifetime. Lacrimosa for string orchestra is the third movement of Chamber Symphony No. 3 (1982). It was subtitled "Holy Rhyme" and secretly dedicated to the Lykovs, an extraordinary family of reclusive Old Believers who were found in the 1970s by an expedition in Altai. The story of the Lykovs stunned the composer. The Canon to the Menacing Angel, the Commander and Guardian, an oratorio based on the texts of Ivan the Terrible for chorus, soloists and instrumental ensemble, is one of the composer's last works (2009). Butsko set an original Old Russian text about the cruel tsar's repentance to music. Without citing any Znamenny chants, the composer musically reexamines this deeply emotional text. Yuri Butsko's works are performed by the musicians who were the composer's close associates for many years - singer Sergei Yakovenko and the symphony orchestra of the Novosibirsk Philharmonic Society led by Arnold Katz, the chamber orchestra of the Moscow Conservatory conducted by Gennady Cherkasov and the choir of students of the Moscow Conservatory led by Stanislav Kalinin.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=MELCD1002556&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Russia,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Through an even more radical attempt to identify with the contemporary attitude of Weber's era, Pier Paolo Vincenzi places himself in the mind of the listener interpreting the message that Weber intended to communicate to his contemporaries, but with the awareness of having to translate that message to the modern listener. Born in Orvieto in 1980, Pier Paolo Vincenzi took piano lessons while still very young in his hometown with Elisa Attioli. By the time he was 20 he had obtained a first class Diploma at the Istituto Pareggiato G. Briccialdi in Terni, under Andrea Trevisan. He then studied with Pier Narciso Masi at the Sesto Fiorentino music school, also attending many of Masi's master classes, including those held at the Accademia Internazionale "Incontri col Maestro" in Imola, where he obtained a Masters Degree in chamber music. He also attended master classes held by teachers such as Massimiliano Damerini, Alexander Lonquich and Guido Salvetti, and the Wiener Meisterkurse under Martin Hughes.

'Liquid Strata' is an important work in Subotnick's oeuvre. Here the electronic component is what he calls "ghost electronics," and this is the first of 11 Ghost Pieces. In these works, Subotnick sought to address technology in a way that highlights rather than compromises the inherent features and strengths of acoustical instruments. In the Ghost Pieces, Subotnick pre-recorded the vocal "energy shapes" on tape. These audio signals were played back (but not heard), combined with sine tones, and sent to an envelope follower. The voltages generated trigger Buchla-produced pitch, amplitude, modulation and stereo panning. All of the Ghost Pieces are to be performed live on a proscenium stage, with speakers in front of the performer. 'The Other Piano is a continuation of the Ghost pieces. The composer refers to the electronics as "a quadraphonic sound painting [spread] throughout the auditorium, done on the spot, intuitively, by a sound painter. ... one always hears the real piano and the transformations are a fantasy, changing in time and space, whirling around the room ..." Subotnick drew conceptual ideas for Falling Leaves from Scarlatti sonatas, a "sense of Scarlatti, but not derivative," particularly repeated notes, the virtuosic crossing of hands, and the idea of cadences. The early Preludes Nos. 1 & 2 are post-Webern influenced works. Prelude No. 4 is the first piece where Subotnick worked with the Buchla synthesizer. The electronic component is composed onto stereo tape, which is played alongside the live piano.

This score, which deliberately withheld Wright and Carlyle's intentions - hence the work's title - was then interpreted by violinist Alison Blunt, pianist Claudia Molitor and trombonist Tullis Rennie, to form side B of this vinyl release. Carlyle and Wright say about the work: "We wanted to create a work that would somehow propel the immediate and futurological aspects of life on a damaged planet. There is a sense of environmental toxicity, debris, heat and movements of the human or more-than-human. Every sound was produced through experimental Foley (post-production) techniques, which seemed apt given the post-natural context we were working within; we were questioning notions of authenticity and the real within the framing and capturing of place. We are really excited to have contributed the first multi.modal record - taking the opportunity to divert Foley from its usual naturalisms, creating a score that disclosed as much as it dissembled, hearing Blunt's, Molitor's and Rennie's uncanny interpretation, working with a label who realize that graphic design forms part of a release's content."",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=MM01&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Contemporary Era,,2018 multi.modal,2018 multi.modal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Given dynamism by commercial exchanges thanks to the bustling activity of the port of Hamburg notably, the cities of the Hanseatic League welcomed many foreign workers, their customs inspiring the artistes of the Germanic tradition. At the end of the seventeenth century, Hamburg was a free city sheltered from war, a refuge for artistes and for great fortunes. It was then the most cosmopolitan city in Germany and its population included a great number of merchants, bankers, diplomats and senators, so many men who were rich and who had the time necessary for enjoying music and for encouraging this flourishing art. As close friends, Johann Adam Reinken, Dietrich Buxtehude - both admired by Bach - and Johann Theile belonged to the circle of contrapuntists of Northern Germany, finding inspiration, however, in the monodic stile nuovo of Italy, championing the idea that music should be at the service of the drama. This musical circle, both professional and friendly, met frequently at Abendmusiken, or musical evenings, created in 1646 in Lübeck by Franz Tunder, organist of the Marienkirche who was to be succeeded by Buxtehude. Organists, great improvisors, the music of the four composers of this programme often comprises suites of short movements in each of which occur identical or related harmonic and melodic elements, characteristics of improvisation and peculiar to the stylus phantasticus, a musical movement dear to composers of this period.

Brassens is above all a voice: an original voice, the voice of a storyteller, of a poet who lyrically relates stories that astonish. There is also the guitar that seems to be a mere accompaniment and yet the harmonies it offers are both effective and subtle, perfectly placed to bring out the power of the words. Yet Brassens is first and foremost this great 'chansonnier', in the purest tradition of his elders, going back several centuries: bards and minstrels, singers of texts and poems, admirers of Villon, Ronsard, Hugo, Nerval, Béranger, Vadé and Rousseau, who understood that the French language was so beautiful when it was sung. These text songs, ballades and complaints, chants and romances come from those practices of the troubadours, where the poet declaimed in music his literary diversions, and Monsieur Brassens is the transmitter of this vast, inexhaustible, indomitable encyclopedia that was the French 'chanson' for over a thousand years. With this 'singing tour' of the musical world of Georges Brassens, Arnaud Marzorati and La Clique des Lunaisiens, specialists in the historic patrimony of the French song, create an original and recent chapter of what was the favorite repertory of the French between 1960 and 1980. To be true, Brassens is the guiding thread of this programme, yet Arnaud Marzorati covers almost five centuries of songs to offer a programme that is original and colorful.

This work, no doubt one of the best known throughout the world, was, however, innovative when it first appeared, for Vivaldi showed himself to be highly precise in his writing, both in terms of the dynamics and the tempi (the term 'Allegro' has 18 different dynamics in his indications). A man born in the seventeenth century, he injected into his music the new dynamism of the following century, without ever neglecting the theatrical aspect of the writing, including the instrumental writing. Would the Venetian composer have really appreciated the performances heard over past decades, be they 'authentically baroque' or, provocatively 'rock-baroque'? The Italian violinist Daniele Orlando, accompanied by the Solisti Aquilani, 'read' and 'play' the contemporaneity of Vivaldi: here there are no effects without cause, never is there an overbearing taste for gratuitous stupefaction as though saying to the listener, "Listen how gifted I am". Instead it is as though restoring his own stupefaction: "Listen how this music is lively and varied". This new recording also poses another question: can one, today, given the state of our planet, interpret the Four Seasons as if our environment was not the result of the major wounds that man has inflicted on it, as if this Nature described by Vivaldi was not threatened? The response of Daniele Orlando is to be found in his musical choices that at times appear radical; yet there is always a pre-eminent care for the expressive dramaturgy in his performance. Lastly, and it is a first, this recording consists of two different mixes of these Four Seasons: a version with natural sound and a second, more contrasted version that will enable the listener to enjoy two different sound environments.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=MU-028&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Baroque Era,Austria,2018 Off The Records,2018 Off The Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Now he releases his debut album on the Neue Meister label. Metcalfe has always been surrounded by music. As a child, he would listen to his father sing opera, before a love of Kraftwerk and Joy Division led to a stint as a drummer in a high school band. But it was a move to Manchester that really accelerated his development as an artist, and led to him finding his true calling. Joining cult band The Durutti Column, then signed to legendary label Factory Records, brought him into the orbit of Tony Wilson and the Haçienda, formative events that would help foster his renegade spirit. Unimpressed with the strictures demanded by the classical recording industry, Metcalfe persuaded Wilson to launch the ground-breaking Factory Classical Label, aimed at unearthing exciting - and unconventional - new British talent. It was here that Metcalfe found a home, and the group that would come to define his musical career; the Duke Quartet. For nearly 30 years, they've existed at the vanguard of contemporary British music, innovating and delighting in equal measure. As a solo artist, Metcalfe explores electro-classical soundscapes and the boundaries between genres. His finely tuned compositions are neat yet grand in scale, both in terms of sound and the conceptual ideas underpinning them. Absence, the fifth record to bear his own name, is something of a departure for Metcalfe, framing bold images and themes with some of the most conventional song structures he's ever employed.

Together, with his well-trained classical composing technique and a sure hand for electronic sound creation, he builds touching musical landscapes. Through the last year, his concerts inspired audiences at the Barbican Center London, Manchester Camerata, Reina Sofia Madrid, Volksbühne Berlin, Elbphilharmonie Hamburg as well as the Enescu Festival Bucharest or Dresden Music Festival. Now, Sven Helbig is on tour with his Forrklang Quartet presenting new compositions and chamber music versions of his well-known pieces.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=0301134NM&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Minimalism,Germany,2018 Edel Germany GmbH,2018 Edel Germany GmbH,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Some songs really are lullabies, beautifully flowing odes that caress your brain and ease the senses. Others have a brightness and energy that's impossible to resist. Together, they make Lilith's Lullabies a thoughtful, contemplative listen, and mark a new chapter in the rise of one of the most talented contemporary composers currently at work. "I used simpler melodies, and harmonies and rhythms which are naturally less complicated, in order to achieve a more accomplished narrative structure, but there's a deeper meaning to this album which happens on the level of sound design. It's important to invite listeners to just enjoy the music, but if they are interested they can dig and find things for themselves", says the composer. Born in Minsk, Belarus, Marhulets has been surrounded by music since he was an infant. Encouraged by his father - his first teacher and role model - he excelled at oboe and piano; he played his first concert at five, and was accepted to the prestigious Minsk College of Music just one year later. He toured and performed with some of the most renowned orchestras in the country, but an adolescence spent focusing on traditional classical music left him restless and creatively unfulfilled. Abandoning the instrument that had been his life, he moved to Germany in 2000, immersing himself in composition and the underground experimental music scene.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=0301145NM&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Minimalism,Germany,2018 Edel Germany GmbH,2018 Edel Germany GmbH,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Padma Newsome was born in Alice Springs, Australia in 1961. He trained as a concert violist in Sydney, touring throughout Australia, China and the Pacific. In the mid 1980's, he left classical performance to spend six years on an ashram in New South Wales where he taught yoga, studied Indian classical music and participated in the center's musical activities. Newsome began formal studies in composition in the 1990's at the University of Adelaide and continued at Yale University on a Fulbright scholarship. His musical palette expresses colors of the modernist avant-garde, folk music from India and chamber music remnants along with energy of the pop/rock world. He composes for traditional large and small ensemble, the electro-acoustic medium, improvised chamber ensemble and music for dance, theatre and film.

Featuring music involving fixed and live interactive electronics, these pieces demonstrate varying contexts within the electro-acoustic medium, from tightly interwoven dialogues between live and pre-recorded material to establishment of acoustic environments within which a soloist steps to the fore. Gythfeldt's virtuosic and sensitive performances are present throughout as a constant on this dynamic release. Clarinetist Marianne Gythfeldt, a native of Norway, has distinguished herself in chamber music, orchestral and contemporary music performance on the international stage. She is equally at-home in traditional, contemporary and alternative/cross-over genres, as a result of the extensive experience and training as clarinetist of Ensemble Sospeso and former member of the Naumburg award-winning group New Millennium Ensemble. Gythfeldt's exceptional ability with contemporary technique, and as a clarinetist who sings through the instrument with a traditionally beautiful tone, led to many collaborations with great soloists and musical innovators such as Alvin Lucier, Peter Serkin, Petr Kotik and the SEM Ensemble, Ursula Oppens, and Paquito D'Rivera. As co-founder of PG2, a sound-art duo, she collaborates with visual artist Ashley Pigford to design original audio-visual pieces for presentation at multimedia conferences.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=FCR220&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Contemporary Era,United States,Marianne Gythfeldt,Marianne Gythfeldt,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When rock music became the music of the new generation, this type of composition was seen less and less. Due to its rarity it is an exciting opportunity to, after all these years, write music for that very composition again." This album features music written for this unique and rarely heard instrumentation composed entirely by Georg Riedel. Georg Riedel is a Swedish double bassist and composer. He migrated to Sweden at age four, and attended school in Stockholm. Riedel's profile as a composer derives almost exclusively from writing music for Astrid Lindgren films, including the main theme from the Emil of Maple Hills movies. He also composed the music for several films by Arne Mattsson in the 1960s as well as for film adaptations of novels by Stig Dagerman.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=NILCD1804&medium=phy,02 Jazz,Jazz,,Sweden,2018 Nilento Records,2018 Nilento Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

That's how the quartett itself characterizes Bach's masterpiece and opposes Stefano Pierini's Cantai un tempo (dopo una lettura di Monteverdi) to the magnum opus which was especially composed for the delian::quartett. The namesake of the delian::quartett is the Greek god Apollo who was worshipped as god of the fine arts, the muses and especially music, and also named Delian after his place of birth, the island of Delos. "What is outstanding about this Quartet", stated the Hessian Broadcasting Company in October 2008, "is, firstly, the absolutely vibrant, personal coloring of their interpretations and the ability to also spontaneously react with interest to what the public shows, to absorb their vibrations and energies and transform them into music.

For they are pieces that emerged spontaneously: nothing but duo improvisations, most of which were recorded on one and the same day in a Bavarian Radio studio in Munich. The lutenist Axel Wolf and the saxophonist Hugo Siegmeth who join forces here are two musicians with roots in completely different musical disciplines. A virtuoso on the lute and theorbo, Axel Wolf specializes in the Renaissance and Baroque periods, whereas Hugo Siegmeth, saxophonist and composer, is an expert on modern jazz and contemporary music.

Many composers have been drawn to the properties of these elements when seeking inspiration for their music, but Kosuge's theme goes deeper, dating back to her successful Beethoven cycle: "When you understand that Shakespeare's plays, read ardently by Beethoven, refer to Greek mythology, or that Beethoven himself composed some works based on the Prometheus myth, you would know that an artist who is searching for human nature would surely look to Greek mythology or philosophy..." In Water, Yu Kosuge interprets a rich array of repertoire, from Liszt and Wagner to acclaimed contemporary composer Dai Fujikura. The 'barcarolle' takes its rocking rhythms from the motion of a boat: we hear examples by Chopin and Fauré, as well as Venetian Gondola 'Songs Without Words' by Mendelssohn.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=ORC100092&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,United Kingdom,2018 Orchid Music Ltd,2018 Orchid Music Ltd,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among the foremost musical figures of our time, Vladimir Ashkenazy was born in Gorky in 1937. He began playing the piano at the age of six and was accepted at the Central Music School at the age of eight. He graduated from the Moscow Conservatory, having studied with Lev Oborin. He won second prize in the International Frédéric Chopin Piano Competition in Warsaw in 1955, first prize in the Queen Elisabeth Music Competition in Brussels in 1956, and joint first prize with John Ogdon in the 1962 International Tchaikovsky Competition. Since then, he has built an extraordinary career, not only as one of the most renowned and revered pianists of our times, but as an artist whose creative life encompasses a vast range of activities and continues to offer inspiration to music-lovers across the world.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=pmr100&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Germany,2018 paladino media,2018 paladino media,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To express oneself, one needs a language, a musical language which is personal and at the same time imparts itself by its own internal logic: to the musicians interpreting the music as well as to the audience listening to it... Anyway, curiosity is one of the most important traits of a composer: one should be aware of what has been achieved already but also know what does not fit into one's musical language. Students of music are often required to work with different styles, compositional techniques and musical languages. They analyze and imitate the music of the great masters also to gain practical experience. However, this may as well result in a high or sometimes exaggerated respect for certain kinds of music. And not without reason: After all, what can a young composer add to a repertoire already developed by the greatest minds through the centuries by writing new symphonies or sonatas? To devise my own musical universe in my work, I thoroughly went through the different aspects and elements of music. I wrote many little pieces which concentrate primarily on the melodic, harmonic, or rhythmical elements and studied possibilities for numerous new sound combinations with unconventional ensembles."",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=PN%201704&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Germany,2017 PN,2017,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This versatile musician's professional career consisted essentially in directing and playing the bombarde with his ensemble in the service of a number of doges and scuole.

It is this refined art that William Dongois and his musicians propose to revive here, drawing on a very rich repertory of dances, songs and madrigals. An ensemble that can vary from two to ten players according to the works being performed, the Concert Brise is made up of musicians who share a common approach to music and to its connection to historical sources. These links form one of the two reference points of the ensemble's interpretations, the other being the use of techniques of improvisation that have been taken from treatises of the period and also from jazz and from folk music. The musicians of the Concert Brise hope to communicate the pleasure that they experience in playing this music to their audiences, whilst at the same time they take the risk of introducing improvisation when it is required.

With the present recording, this musical treasure, which has slumbered in the archives for centuries, is being awakened from its beauty sleep. Although Bigaglia's number mass, which consists only of Kyrie and Gloria, is rooted in the aesthetics of the Baroque, it also reveals slight echoes of sentimentalism. The ""Missa"" is supplemented by Antonio Lotti's ""Credo,"" which with its eight-part, highly dissonant ""Cruzifixus"" forms a further highlight of the program. The Hanover Boys' Choir and La Festa Musicale will play at their usual high standard and create an impressive soundscape in the outstanding acoustics in the church of the Stephansstift in Hanover.

Even though bass is the instrument he prefers, his playing, undemonstrative and to the point, is simply the reflection of research into improvisation and precise writing. Ever since his musical beginnings, he has always been exploring new horizons, enlarging his perspective, going behind the decor and questioning his own music-making in order to draw up the map of his own inner world.

Both are united by their emergence in the atmosphere of the amateur orchestra founded by Otto Hatwig, in which Franz played the viola, and his brother Ferdinand the violin. This orchestra was a stroke of luck for the young Schubert, akin to a laboratory where he could thoroughly test his compositions against the works of composing contemporaries such as Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven and Méhul, and in real world conditions. Nevertheless, in their compositional intent, the symphonies are so fundamentally different that it is tempting to present these two dissimilar siblings on one album. Looking at the entire cycle of the Schubert symphonies, and the existential crisis in which Schubert found himself after 1818, this criticism seems in hindsight to be justified only to a certain extent. The creative chasm that opened up in front of Schubert is documented in his many symphonic drafts and abandoned works. In chamber music and in song composition, his productivity likewise decreased considerably. At that time, there was also the break with his father. Against this background, the Sixth seems like a charming "coming-of-age" work that demonstrated to the composer - with the utmost severity - the creative limits of youth-fuelled ardor.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=SM296&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Orchestral,Austria,2018 Solo Musica,2018 Solo Musica,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The new recording is the latest offering from a highly acclaimed partnership between SOMM and McCawley that has seen earlier albums devoted to Haydn, Chopin, Schumann, Brahms, Rachmaninov and Samuel Barber. Leon McCawley has been one Britain's foremost pianists since winning the International Beethoven Piano Competition in 1993, when he also took second prize in the Leeds International Piano Competition. Perhaps "the most enigmatic of all musical geniuses", as Bryce Morrison describes him, Schubert himself famously declared "I came into this world for nothing else but to compose". Two masterpieces are heard here. The Drei Klavierstücke saw Schubert reaching out in a radical new direction to deliver, says Morrison, something "wild, feverish, disjointed and intimate... visionary music with a vengeance". The Wanderer Fantasy is a luxurious display of virtuoso opulence - music the like of which wouldn't be heard again until Liszt at his most incendiary - that makes fearsome demands on the soloist. Four songs arranged by Liszt remain uncannily faithful to Schubert's originals while adding an extra dimension of drama and sophistication to show both composers at their melodic and dramatic best. Leon McCawley's previous recordings for SOMM have received wide critical praise. Gramophone hailed his complete Rachmaninov Preludes as "a distinguished issue", Fanfare described his playing of Brahms as "music-making of a very high order" with International Record Review adding: "When all is said and done, it is difficult to know whether McCawley's refined piano playing, his natural yet cultivated musicality or his boundless imagination warrants the greater praise. You must hear the recording". His recording of Haydn's Sonatas and Variations received a coveted Diapason d'Or and the "superb collection" of Barber's piano music was a Gramophone Editor's Choice.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=SOMMCD%200188&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,EU,2018 SOMM Recordings,2018 SOMM Recordings,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Volume III features pianist Andrew West and baritone Roderick Williams (both heard on Volumes I and II) and the return of soprano Sarah Fox (who appeared on Volume II). Composed between 1874 and shortly before Parry's death in 1918, the English Lyrics come from a time of immense change as old certainties gave way to new complexity and a global war that would utterly change Britain's standing in the world. Parry's riposte was the English Lyrics: a defiant assertion that English poetry was the equal of Germany's Lied and French mélodies and arguably created the template for the development of the emerging English art-song. The texts of many of the 25 songs - including some of his finest - on this recording carry deeply personal meanings for Parry, his response to them as varied as mood dictates and all realized with consummate insight and craftsmanship. Settings of AP Graves, Julia Chatterton and Julian Sturgis are to the fore, although lyrics by Herbert Warner and the American poets Ralph Waldo Emerson and Langdon Elwyn Mitchell are also to be heard in a spell- binding conclusion to an acclaimed series. Parry's only setting of Christina Rossetti, 'My heart is like a singing bird,' is delightfully effusive, 'When the Sun's Great Orb,' Wagner-like in its imagining of the end of days, 'The child and the twilight' vividly full of night-time fears. Reviewing Volume I, BBC Music Magazine praised the "many pleasurable moments in this richly enjoyable album" with Classical Ear summing it up as being "In a word: blissful". Of Volume II, Robert Hugill applauded "this enterprising and illuminating survey", while MusicWeb International said: "Lovers of English songs, and Parry in particular, should be in their element with this satisfying album on Somm".",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=SOMMCD%20272&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,EU,2018 SOMM Recordings,2018 SOMM Recordings,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The album takes the listener on a journey through Thorvaldsdottir's soundworld, where sounds and nuances are as much part of the meticulously structured tapestry of the music as harmonies and lyrical material. The works are performed by the International Contemporary Ensemble, with two works conducted by Steven Schick and a work for solo piano performed by Cory Smythe. "Internally, I hear sounds and nuances as musical melodies and in my music I weave various textures of sounds together with harmonies and pitched lyrical material. The music is written as an ecosystem of sounds and materials that are carried from one performer -- or performers -- to the next throughout a progress of a work. As a performer plays a phrase, harmony, texture or a lyrical line it is being delivered to another performer as it transforms and develops, passed on to be carried through until it is passed on again to yet another. All materials continuously grow in and out of each other, growing and transforming throughout the piece. My music is often inspired in an important way by nature and its many qualities, but I do not strive to describe or literally incorporate elements from nature in my music. To me, the qualities of the music are first and foremost musical -- so when I am inspired by a particular element that I perceive in nature, it is because I perceive it as musically interesting. The qualities I tend to be inspired by are often structural, like proportion and flow, as well as relationships of balance between details within a larger structure, and how to move in perspective between the two -- the details and the unity of the whole. The pieces for smaller forces on AEQUA orbit the largest work Aequilibria, which is written for a chamber ensemble of 12 performers. Aequilibria was inspired by various states of balancing forces -- by the natural breath between expansion and contraction, and the perspectives of translucence and opacity. This inspiration can be applied to the whole collection of pieces on AEQUA -- the works breathe in and out of focus, expand and contract within their individual characters but reflect on each other through their various internal connections from beginning to end.

The album reflects Vuust's love for the beautiful melodies in ""The great American Songbook"", but at the same time it carries a European tone that with the distinctive sound of the accordion brings to mind Italian summer nights and French chanson. The European tone is set by British trumpet player Gerard Presencer and Italian pianist and accordionist Francesco Calì, and through the almost chamber music like arrangements runs a somewhat melancholic vein that together with Clara Vuust's warm and alluring voice create a romantic and thoughtful atmosphere. The songs on ""Before You Walk Away"" are inspired by Vuust's fondness for the American Jazz standard repertoire, but also by her love for Italian evergreens and French Jazz by the composer Michel Legrand among others. Her voice and interpretations draw on inspiration from great singers such as Irene Kral, the Swedish singer Monica Zetterlund and Barbra Streisand. The title of the album ""Before You Walk Away"" is a line from the song ""I Wish You Love"". About the choice of title Clara says: "All the songs on this album are in some way or another based on the theme of saying goodbye and parting with the ones you love. The title ""Before you walk away"" is a reflection upon that moment where we go our separate ways - the bittersweet sorrow, but also the love, that lies in the departure...""",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=SVL1014322&medium=phy,02 Jazz,Jazz,Jazz|Mainstream Jazz,EU,Storyville Records,Storyville Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He wrote the first of his two piano quartets at the age of 34, by which time many a publisher was interested in his works. The Czech media voiced their satisfaction that Dvorák had moved beyond foreign influence, with the Slavic spirit having prevailed in his music. Cases in point include his Moravian Duets, Op. 20, and Serenades, Op. 22, created at the same time. The publisher Fritz Simrock bitterly regretted having rejected the first quartet, persistently reminding the composer: "I would gladly take a piano quartet, preferably even two". When in the summer of 1889 Dvorák got down to writing his second quartet, he complained of having a "slow hand", yet stressed that he had plenty of ideas: "My head is full of it ... I have finished three movements of a new quartet with piano, and the finale will be ready in a few days. It has gone smoothly beyond expectation, with the melodies rolling in to me." The sheer beauty of the piece was cogently described by the prominent Vienna-based critic Eduard Hanslick: "The quartet requires that the listener be considerably attentive and well informed, which, however, really pays off."
