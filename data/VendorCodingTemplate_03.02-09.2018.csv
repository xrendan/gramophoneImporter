Indeed, his intention to create a new era in art is here in full display, not only in the magical sonorities he managed to evoke from the instrument, but also in his revolutionary lyricism, present from the onset, in which operatic archetypes unite with completely new pianistic intuitions. Chopin’s nocturnes were the works of an inspired soul; in turn, they inspired future generations of composers. A prize winner in the XVI International Chopin Piano Competition in Warsaw, French pianist Francois Dumont presents a double album featuring Chopin’s complete nocturnes. Dumont brings years of life experience in this performance, playing with refinement and inspiration. In addition to the nocturnes that Chopin published during his lifetime, the present recording includes the Nocturne in E Minor, possibly written in Warsaw in 1827 and published posthumously in 1855 as part of Op. 72; the Nocturne in C Minor, B. 108, written in 1837 but published only in 1938; and a piece inscribed “Largo con gran espressione,” a work Chopin composed for his sister in 1830 as she studied his Second Piano Concerto (thematic material from the Concerto in F Minor is recognizable throughout the piece). The latter is perhaps one of Chopin’s most celebrated works, and was titled “nocturne” only upon its publication in 1875. Mr. Dumont’s recording of Chopin’s complete nocturnes took place on February 2017 and is recorded with 3 microphones stereo pair.",http://youtube.com/onclassical/,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=AE17044,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Romantic Era,,OnClassical,AEVEA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Expanding upon something as simple as a photograph or a memory, Miller's noir-influenced jazz expands his reflections beyond words, and instead creates story through moods. The album features both contemporary compositions, as late as 2017, as well as some that Miller had written back in the 1980s. Each track was inspired by snapshots in Miller's life, a soundtrack to a particular date in time with one of Miller's family members. The bustling, sweeping opener “Sebastian's Day Off” took its tempo from a day Miller spent in the park with his son. The composition makes quick jumps from energetic bebop to smooth lounge to bouncy jazz, providing readers with the breakneck direction changes that come with entertaining a small child. Meanwhile, the more solemn “Inky and Marie” carries a ghostly feel in its opening chords, alluding to the sorrow Miller felt when his Aunt Marie's dog Inky passed away one night during a visit. Like a photo album set to sound, Miller’s compositions lets the listener into some of his most cherished memories.

When a violin and a double bass come together, two sound spheres collide: particularly in recent times, many renowned composers have been inspired to create highly original realisations of such encounters. When a violin and a double bass perform chamber music together, it is a case of two instruments encountering each other when normally they are poles apart and play together only alongside additional parts and colours. This is where the composers who have come forward for this adventure of a violin and double bass duo link in: should contrasts be accentuated, or should the two parts be united to form one ""super-instrument"", as Erkki-Sven Tuur had in mind? Should the two instruments be protagonists in a ""narrative"", or do they appear as representatives of fundamental principles of human nature - as in the yin and yang, as drawn upon by the Korean composer Isang Yun? Whichever path is chosen, pairing the violin and the double bass is so fascinating that even busy composers such as Krzysztof Penderecki and Wolfgang Rihm have written magnificent and highly individual pieces for this combination. Violinist Elina Va¨ha¨la¨ is one of the most sought-after instrumentalists in the international music scene.

The movie won the Special Mention award at Golden Prague International Film Festival 2017 for exceptional artistic achievement as it ""excels in the exhilerating choreography, the vivid lighting, and the brilliant camerawork and editing.""",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=BAC149,01 Classical,Classical,,Austria,,2018 Bel Air Classiques,,5,Alexander Ekman; Frederik Stattin; Jenny Nilson; Joakim Stephenson; Nadja Sellrup; Nathalie Nordquist; Oscar Salomonsson; Par Isberg; Pontus Lidberg; Stefan Levin (Composer),Fredrik Stattin,1,,Bel Air Classiques,AT,NR,NTSC,0,DVD-9,Swedish,"French, English, Korean, Japanese","PCM 2.0, Dolby Digital 5.1",Color,16:9,132,2017,"Amazon VOD,iTunes,Naxos Video Library"
2018,BC,Berlin Classics,0301014BC,885470010144,Claude Debussy,Unfolding Debussy,Marina Baranova,1,CD,14.81,22.99,"Since Marina Baranova first played Clair de Lune as an eager nine-year-old a question had stayed with her: Was there another side to Debussy’s music, one influenced by his turbulent private life and tempestuous relationships? “When you think of the great impressionist painters, you think of light, and hope, and love,” she says. “But Debussy adored the darkness of Baudelaire, and was heavily influenced by Wagner. The titles he gave his pieces also hint at hidden meanings, so I thought it would be interesting to explore this ‘shadow’ side and my feelings towards it.” Now Marina Baranova's album Unfolding Debussy will be released to mark the occasion of the 100th anniversary of Claude Debussy's death in March 2018. Despite being “absolutely in love” with Debussy, Baranova had also grown tired of playing his work in the common, classical way. Coming back to his music, she resolved to discover new ways of playing while exploring this darkness, and set about deconstructing some of his best loved pieces. It was here she had a vision, and the concept of “unfolding” his work took shape. To emulate the richness of Debussy’s original compositions, Baranova sought a broader palette and different textures. “Every instrument has its own color,” she says, and so a number of different pianos and keyboards were employed to help to weave her magic. An Una Corda, a Fender Rhodes, midi keyboards and a C. Bechstein grand piano all feature, as do a number of delays and arpeggiators; anything to match the mood and the colours she could see in her head. Unusually for a classical pianist, she took it upon herself to both write and sing lyrics for various tracks, something she claims “wasn’t a decision, but an intuition. At the start, this wasn’t my intention, but the words just came.”",https://youtu.be/fTyLwCoD-Tc,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=0301014BC,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Piano,Germany,2018 Edel Germany GmbH,2018 Edel Germany GmbH,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Their St John Passion live from Dresden’s Frauenkirche enthralled audience and critics alike at Passiontide 2017. Release on a double album not only makes this great work readily accessible at home, it transports you directly into an unforgettable evening of drama. Matthias Grunert, the Frauenkirche’s Erster Kantor since the church’s rededication, is the seasoned Bach expert who leads the Chamber Choir and ensemble Frauenkirche Dresden through the Passion. These experienced musical partners are complemented by a group of internationally renowned soloists: Camilla Nylund (soprano) and Andreas Scheibner (bass), both Kammersanger of the Land of Saxony, Nicole Pieper (alto), Falko Honisch (Vox Christi) – and at their head Tilman Lichdi (Evangelist), one of the great recitative tenors of our day. Bach’s Passio secundum Johannem is the later of the two Passions of his that have come down to us complete. It portrays the dramatic turns of events and fateful inevitability of the last hours of Jesus, the Christ, “intensely, and altogether with genius, notably in the choruses,” or so Robert Schumann concluded. The city’s Frauenkirche provides the perfect backdrop to the intense drama of the Passion music, having a direct link to Bach: it was in this church, in the year 1736, that the great Thomaskantor played the newly dedicated organ in that sacred place where his “Passion according to John” was to be enacted almost three hundred years later.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=0300995BC,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Oratorio,Germany,2018 Edel Germany GmbH,2018 Edel Germany GmbH,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He left a large oeuvre comprising almost all musical genres and also had an interest in jazz all his life. He developed a ‘system of variable metres’ to berak musical form and rhythmic symmetry with numerous, arithmetically structured metre changes. Krebs, Sberk, Dugong and Prelude 16 are typical examples of this technique.” Those are four out of 16 compositions that Manuela Keller got her teeth into, both as a soloist and in a quartet. Three are written by Keller, the other ten are adaptations, some more subtle, others more extensive, of models from Blachers late 24 Preludes for piano, his piano cycle Ornamente, and his Second Sonatina. Thus, Idee manu’s second album fits perfectly into the programmatic line of Between the Lines, focusing on sound projects crossing styles and genres between improvisation and composition.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=BTLCHR71244,02 Jazz,Jazz,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is not “just another pops album.” Paley’s work is cool, clever, and ridiculously fun. Seven of the ten tracks on The More You Know are completely composed, arranged, and performed by Ron Paley. “Theme” is energetic, exploring elements of upbeat jazz and classic boogie woogie. Fast-paced, too, is “U of M” where the artist/composer delves into the genres of gospel and rock as well—surprising the listener at the end with his impressive talent for percussing vocally. “A Beautiful Soul,” and “P&Q” are exquisite jazz ballads that are par with the perfection of those Weill, Porter, or Gershwin. This is demonstrated, too, in Paley’s Ballad Trilogy. “Listen to the Sound,” explores the rhythmic character inherent in Latin dance genres. The title track, “The More You Know,” is fresh and improvisatory. Paley’s mash-up arrangement of Dietz and Schwartz’s “Alone Together” an Orbison’s “Pretty Woman,” is the most experimental track on the album and demonstrates Paley’s gift for transforming the expected into something altogether new. Paley’s arrangement of Tchaikovsky’s “Waltz of the Flowers,” is a lounge treat, unlike any other interpretation of the favorited Nutcracker tune. Paley brings the same sort of originality to his fabulous arrangement of Chopin’s Prelude in C-Minor, which concludes this treasure of a recording.",https://youtu.be/ZtoflXhF9_Y,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=BR8951,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Piano,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bach: Solo Keyboard Music, Vol. 35",Miklos Spanyi,1,CD,15.59,23.99,"As Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach published successive collections of the Kenner und Liebhaber series, he explored new genres and styles. In the second collection he added his idiosyncratic rondos, and in the fourth he included free fantasias. The fifth collection, composed between 1779 and 1784, contains no new genres, but displays more variety in terms of textures and thematic ideas than any of the previous volumes. In fact, Bach’s preoccupation with variation is almost obsessive – it is as if he cannot finish phrases without varying either texture, tonality, rhythmic pulse or dynamics. To the six Sonatas, Rondos and Fantasias that make up the collection, Miklos Spanyi adds two independent works. Bach initially composed 17 variations on the folk-like tune Ich schlief, da traumte mir in 1752 (included in Vol. 19 of this series) but returned to it almost twenty years later, publishing seven new variations. Closing the album is another set of variations, now on an original theme, an Arioso sostenuto in A major. Miklos Spanyi began his survey of the Kenner und Liebhaber collections on the clavichord but the following releases have featured the tangent piano. And 35 albums into this monumental series, individual volumes are still being warmly greeted, for instance on EarlyMusicReview.com where the reviewer of Volume 32 (BIS-2205) professed to be ‘invariably struck not only by the originality of C.

In order to celebrate the centennial of Bernstein’s birth in 1918, Christian Lindberg has gathered music from five different productions spanning a period of 13 years – from Fancy Free to the iconic musical West Side Story, premiered in 1957. The disc is bookended by the sparkling and witty Overture to Candide and Three Dance Episodes from the musical On the Town. Also included is the substantial Symphonic Suite from ‘On the Waterfront’, developed by Bernstein from the score he wrote for Elia Kazan’s classic film. The drama of this tale of love and betrayal set amid the docks of Hoboken in New Jersey is brought out by Bernstein’s music, which seethes with dramatic tension. Making its first appearance on BIS in these flamboyant and life-enhancing scores, the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra clearly relishes the opportunity to let its collective hair down.

The plan was for the mass to be ready for performance at the enthronement celebrations in March 1820, but one year proved to be too little time. It wasn’t until almost three years later, in January 1823, that Beethoven was able to complete the work. As might be expected, it was unparalleled in every respect – although composed for use during church services, even Beethoven’s contemporaries found that it exceeded the bounds of the genre. Beethoven himself was quite aware of both the dimensions and the importance of the work: in a letter he described it as ‘my greatest work’. It is also a work which over its course encompasses great contrasts: from the solemnity of the Kyrie and the intense excitement at the opening of the Gloria to the disturbing intimations of war during the closing Dona nobis pacem. Originally founded with the aim of performing the choral works of Bach, the Bach Collegium Japan and Masaaki Suzuki are now taking another great leap, after their recent release of Mozart’s Great Mass in C minor.

One way to do this is to forge a stronger bond between the players and the classical tradition, in the knowledge that the saxophone repertoire too is indebted to the great composers of the past. The most influential of them all is, without a doubt, Johann Sebastian Bach. The path to this recording was long, windy and fascinating. It started with the awareness that the cello suites provide exceptional playing material for saxophonists. But I long felt that for playing Bach on the saxophone, only the light-sounding soprano saxophone would do- which was, I believed, incompatible with the instrument for which the suites were written. During preparations for my previous recording of Bach’s partitas for violin, I discovered that the alto sax- fitted with an old-style mouthpiece- could reproduce the refined articulation of the violin. Vintage mouthpieces represent the sound ideal of days gone by. Then came the idea to play the suites on six different saxophones, each of which holds a unique place in the history of the instrument. After that, much time went into working out a usable assignment of transpositions and an appropriate choice of instruments, the resulting sound character being the deciding factor.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=CC%2072769,01 Classical,Classical,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It presents an enormous spectrum of sound colors as well as the possibility of polyphony when played in conjunction with a loop and other effect pedals. It has inspired me significantly as a classical musician and I cannot now imagine undertaking my compositions and improvisations without it. Improvisation directly engages intuition and spontaneity which in turn enlarges perspective. Following the improvisations which I combined with the Bach suites and works by contemporary composers, I felt the need to work on a larger piece. This has resulted in ‘STAGIONI.’ I could not nor have I wished to ignore Vivaldi and have woven several quotes from his masterpiece into my improvisations. Inspiration has also come from the medieval mystic and first recognized feminine composer, Hildegard von Bingen. Other primal sources which have fed me along the way include early polyphony, Sephardic folk music and Afro-American blues. This was not according to any plan, rather repertoire influences which are recognizable only in hindsight.”",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=CC%2072772,01 Classical,Classical,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

William Cornysh and Benjamin Britten were prolific in both sacred and secular music. Cornysh is actually two people, often confused with one another and quite possibly father and son. The matter of telling which man wrote which works is impossible to settle, so for the purpose of this album they are linked as one. So whether it be the Elder or the Younger, we are fortunate that they not only excelled at writing complex and adventurous antiphons for the church but also beautiful secular songs for the Tudor court. For Britten writing in the 20th-century life was very different; he is a composer who encompassed so many facets of music excelling in opera, solo song and all manners of vocal and instrumental music. This album looks at the way these composers mixed sacred with secular. Whilst Cornysh’s sacred music is elaborate and rhythmically complicated, his secular music is simple yet subtly evocative.

Mvravinsky adored him for his Tchaikovsky interpretations and the Neue Zurcher Zeitung called him respectfully “the Georgian Karajan.” And indeed, although most comparisons go lame there were some similarities: the economical gestures, the endless working on sound perfection, the passion for big dynamics and a great affection for the Golden Age of classic and romantic music. But other than Karajan he did not only put most of his emphasis on the sheer beauty of the orchestral sound but also investigated the disaccords in the music and did not hesitate to unfold it.

First of all, they share a process of writing that oscillates between monody and polyphony, where a motivic cell is elaborated in a coherent and essential language, apparently simple. Then, the improvisation is often the starting point of their compositions and the nurturing force that generates structures in a finely tuned form. The obsessive interest in geometric shapes and numbers is visibly present all along their work and spirituality inspires them to create music that reflects the transcendental.

With an ensemble of only 12-16 top-quality musicians, the Pocket Philharmonic Orchestra explores Beethoven's musical origins.  All the great conductors and orchestras have shown where Beethoven led: how his ideas paved the way for later masters like Schumann, Bruckner and Mahler. What hasn't been shown yet is where Beethoven was: where his musical language came from, how he shifted standards and developed techniques in a completely new and revolutionary way. The Pocket Philharmonic has a new approach to this idea: instead of a full chamber or symphony orchestra, the ensemble performs as a chamber ensemble in a symphonic manner – symphonic chamber music, or chamber music symphonies, so to speak. ""This is the most vivid performance of the Eroica you have ever heard"" said the critics. “It makes the revolution in his music audible.

Born Giovanni Francesco Grossi in 1653 in the Grand Duchy of Tuscany, Siface was acclaimed for his exciting musical performances, yet who became famous also for the tragedy of his love life. He was called upon to sing in operas and oratorios by the likes of Stradella, Pasquini, Bassani, Pallavicino and Agostini. For a long time in the service of Francesco II d’Este in Modena, Siface was an active member of the musical “ducal circuit” in the Italian peninsula, even, on one occasion, additionally being sent to England, where he performed before monarchy, and met and impressed Henry Purcell. Filippo Mineccia brilliantly captures the kaleidoscopic rush of emotions coursing through this selection of arias, which reflects the torrid and spectacular musical pace of life in late seventeenth-century Italy (as well as mirroring Siface’s own downfall on the road from Ferrara to Bologna). The Spanish ensemble Nereydas fully enter into the spirit of this, by turns, colourful, heartfelt, poignant and vivid celebration of vocal and instrumental music, which also features works by Alessandro Scarlatti (the emotive lullaby Dormi o fulmine), Francesco Cavalli and Purcell (My song shall be alway).",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=GCD923514,01 Classical,Classical,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nearly all the recordings were made during concerts in the cathedral acoustics of Ebrach’s abbey church. The location Schaller chose for the recordings of the F minor Symphony, the early D minor Symphony and the Fourth Symphony with its Volksfest  finale is the Regentenbau building in Bad Kissingen, which likewise has outstanding acoustics. What is special about this Bruckner cycle is that Schaller in some cases selected less well-known, “interim” versions or variants that had previously never been performed but give revealing insights into Bruckner’s compositional approach. Featured for the first time ever in this edition are Bruckner’s Third in its first revised form of 1874 and his Eighth in the interim version of 1888. The cycle of symphonies is supplemented by the F minor Mass, the rarely performed Psalm 146 and his organ works.

The four Russian composers are recent graduates of the Moscow State Tchaikovsky Conservatory, and have presented four small pieces that have the same instrumental line-up and creative challenge – they were to pick up a part of Austria as an inspiration. A small country of mountains and lakes in Central Europe with numerous wildlife, nearly untouched locations dazzling with virgin beauty, Austria is at the same time one of the centres for global music culture. Its capital Vienna is the city where some of the greatest composers lived and created. Needless to say that the Vienna State Opera and Philharmonic Orchestra still top the list of the world’s best music companies. Denis Khorov’s Music for Oneself is dedicated to Vienna; Anna Romashkova’s Partly Cloudy was inspired by the famous spa town Bad Ischl located in Upper Austria and associated with the names of Brahms, Bruckner, Lehar and Johann Strauss II; Kuzma Bodrov (arguably the best known of the four composers) dedicated his Partita to a steppe landscape of Burgenland, a state bordering with Hungary; the leader of a contemporary music centre Sanzhar Baiterekov built his structural composition Outlines of Steiermark having in mind the highest peaks of the largest cities of a southeastern state of Styria.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=MELCD1002511,01 Classical,Classical,,Russia,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Even the most partial of the reviewers noted their in-depth comprehension of styles, reflection of the composers' creative spirits in their interpretations no matter which of the periods the pianists would turn to. This album features four sonatas four-hands by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, including the unfinished KV357, and also his sonata for two pianos KV448, which stands out for its vivid, truly concert style what brings it closer to the genre of piano concerto.

To do justice to this perfection, the recording is also released in full-spectrum sound quality. Gulda, rebel among pianists, was a great admirer of Debussy’s music. As early as the 1940s, he proved with his recordings of “L’isle joyeuse” and “Reflets dans l’eau” his infallible sense of the composer’s music.

He died 4 August 2003. In his music everything flows naturally and authentically, albeit in simplicity. Everything originates in the understanding of the sacred text and in its musical thought, which are then expressed through a safe technique.

Rather than attempting to shatter musical boundaries, McEncroe focuses on the introspective, letting the listener’s stories and memories give the music its own unique life. Divided into two volumes titled “Reflections” and “Recollections,” Musical Images for Piano is performed solo by pianist Yoko Hagino. McEncroe draws his inspiration from the setting of his Japanese garden, but beyond that, the composer does little to share his own stories. Instead, he encourages the listener to create an atmosphere where they can turn inward to give the compositions depth by associating them with their own memories. Like paintings, McEncroe’s compositions begin simply with a title. “Daybreak,” the opening song in the second volume, the tender slur of melody brings to life a moment of renewal, almost as if you can hear the sun rising for a new beginning. On “Natalie’s Theme,” the melody wafts along sorrowful tones. The composition characterizes someone that feels familiar, knowing everything about her through song.

The composer, himself, likens its thematic content with “the continuity of a changing dream.” The string quartet Morceaux des Noces, is reflective of the Americana in early 20th century composition. Sonata “Los Dedicatorias,” for violin and piano is tentative, with the juxtaposition of the highest part of violin’s range against the warm, middle tones of the piano. Messiaen lovers will enjoy Variations for string quartet, which is reminiscent of Quatuor pour la fin du temp and the ethereal qualities within it.

The North Carolina-based composer is renowned for his original blend of South American styles, astonishing rhythms, and lyrical melodies with powerful evocative intensity. Rutty’s compositions explore ambitious philosophical queries ranging from the break-neck swells of excitement to the calm delicacy of wonder. Exhaling Space gracefully navigates experimentation and tradition. Works like Transparent Sun interweave piano and violin beautifully, building tension between the two instruments into an engaging conflict like staging a debate within your mind. The title track also inhabits a classically-infused world, yet the rhythms weave in South American tropes as if they were transported into a fourth dimension.

Led by Carmela O’Flaherty, the composer’s daughter, the project consists nearly entirely of previously unperformed and unrecorded works for piano. Pianist Benjamin Goodman masterfully interprets her vibrant, virtuosic music. Feigin’s music is full of formidable technical challenges for the pianist, most readily apparent in her breathless and frenetic Toccata, based on a folk theme from her native Latvia. Her interest in folk elements is inseparable from her concern with human suffering. Her Sonata is the best example of this. It contains some of her most visceral and emotional writing, building to the third movement, titled The Last Way. This movement was dedicated to the victims of Latvia’s Babi Yar concentration camp, and draws from Joseph Kuzkovsky’s painting depicting the carnage, “Led to the Slaughter – Babi Yar.” Goodman writes: “For the pianist, it is such an exciting and emotionally challenging experience to play such music – it demands every ounce of concentration and energy in order to play these sections successfully.” It is Feigin’s humanitarian approach to these topics that make the music resonate with the listener. Her lighter pieces are also a treat.

Intense and scandalous, Casanova’s extraordinary adventures take the listener on an incredible voyage across 18th-century Europe – from France to Russia, Poland to Spain and Turkey to Germany, with Venice at their heart. He falls madly in love, has wild flings and delirious orgies, and encounters some of the most brilliant figures of his time, including Catherine the Great, Louis XV and Benjamin Franklin. He holds a verbal dual with Voltaire, a pistol duel with a Polish noble, and finds himself hauled before the court multiple times, including in London, where the judge in question turns out to be none other than Henry Fielding. His appetite for life is voracious; for him, a life lived close to the precipice is the only life worth living. The book is divided into six sections. Volume 1 contains the first two sections: ‘1: Venetian Years’ and ‘2: To Paris and Prison’.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=NA0297,15 Spoken Word,Spoken Word,,England,2018 Naxos AudioBooks,2018 Naxos AudioBooks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In his musical depiction of these images, Hersch writes music that is at times aggressive and disturbing and at other times wistful, but always with the profound intensity of a deeply sensitive nature. Mazur wrote of Hersch’s music: “These compositions are filled sometimes with frightening sounds.

Schubert wrote two overtures ‘in the Italian style,’ in November 1817. No doubt they were inspired by the Rossini craze that was sweeping Vienna. In the C major overture an Adagio with Rossinian wind solos precedes the main Allegro which concludes with a lively coda. Throughout the overture the jaunty Italianate rhythms and robust harmonic patterns of Schubert’s model are apparent, but the composer’s own gifts are also in evidence. From an early age Schubert was interested in composing for the theatre. He was commissioned to compose incidental music for Helmina von Chezy’s four-act play Rosamunde, which premiered in December 1823 and was withdrawn after only one performance. Schubert’s music, however, was edited and republished, and has retained popularity. Finally, the album presents his Symphony No 8 in B minor, ‘Unfinished.’ The most remarkable of his aborted compositions, the work stands in powerful contrast to his other unfinished symphonies, as the first two movements, which he completed to the detail, were among the finest he ever wrote.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=NI7098,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Orchestral,United Kingdom,This compilation 2018 Wyastone Estate Limited,This compilation 2018 Wyastone Estate Limited,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It  includes Piano Concertos Nos. 2 and 4, two outstanding examples of Beethoven's writing. Conducting Royal Northern Sinfonia from the keyboard, Vogt’s fresh interpretations of Beethoven concertos have been widely welcomed, and recently he was nominated for Artist of the Year 2017 by the Gramophone magazine. Beethoven’s 2nd Piano Concerto was largely written before 1789. The work was premiered in 1795 with Beethoven debuting as piano soloist. This early work shows the influence of Mozart but at the same time it is a powerful evidence of Beethoven’s development as a composer towards maturity. Beethoven’s 4th Piano Concerto is considered by many as his best achievement in the field of piano concerto. Beethoven opens this work in a revolutionary way by means of a calm dialogue between the piano and the orchestra. The second movement includes some of the most dramatic music that Beethoven ever wrote – only to be contrasted by the boundless joy and freedom of the final movement. Lars Vogt was appointed the first ever “Pianist in Residence” by the Berlin Philharmonic in 2003/04 and enjoys a high profile as a soloist and chamber musician.

Bach - Reconstructed Chamber Music & Chorals,Michael Form; Marie Rowuie; Étienne Floutier; Dirk Borner,1,CD,14.81,22.99,"Johann Sebastian Bach’s chamber music was in constant transition. His few surviving trio sonatas, for the traditional combination of two melody instruments and continuo, likely date from his years in Weimar and Kothen. Bach revisited some of these works in Leipzig, reworking them for concerts at Zimmerman’s coffee house into sonatas for a melody instrument with harpsichord obbligato. Unfortunately, few of these manuscripts survive, leaving us with only later arrangements as rough clues to their original form and instrumentation.  Prominent Bach scholars agree that Bach, just as Handel and Telemann, must have made a major contribution to the main genre of 18th century chamber music. In view of this evaluation, there is a particularly unfortunate gap in the catalogue of the Thomaskantor’s works.

Aus der Ferne illuminates the Romanticism and lyricism of this great master. By combining string quartets with lieder arranged for string quartet, the members of the Signum Quartett aim to show how Schubert’s instrumental and vocal music cross-pollinate each other. The fact that Schubert quotes openly from his own songs in his chamber music underlines the strong connection between the two, and this album takes this connection a step further. The concept for the album grew out of the Schubertiad, where chamber music and vocal works would be heard side by side in an intimate setting. A further idea was to complement one of the late quartets with an earlier one - perhaps lesser-known but not a lesser piece. The B-flat major quartet and the Rosamunde Quartet, both featured on this album, share a delicacy and fragility of spirit; convey a longing from afar. These instrumental works gain significance by being accompanied by the lieder arrangements, created by quartet member Xandi van Dijk. These arrangements present quintessential Schubert lieder such as Du bist die Ruh, Wandrers Nachtlied and Lachen und Weinen in a new, fascinating light.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=PTC5186673,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Chamber Music,Germany,2018 PENTATONE,2018 PENTATONE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The pianist had intimate ties to the composer himself and his wife, Yvonne Loriod, for whom Messiaen wrote the Catalogue. Praised by The Guardian as “one of the best Messiaen interpreters around,“ this is Aimard’s first recording of Messiaen’s most extensive, demanding and colourful piano composition. The luxurious release set contains an accompanying bonus film, on which Aimard shares his vast knowledge of and love for Messiaen’s work from behind the piano. Due to its radical naturalism, the Catalogue d’Oiseaux is exceptional within the repertoire for solo piano. It is the grand hymn to nature from a man who never ceased to marvel at the stupefying beauty of landscapes or the magic of bird song. With his Catalogue, Messiaen tried – in his own words – “to render exactly the typical birdsong of a region, surrounded by its neighbours from the same habitat, as well as the form of song at different hours of the day and night,” suggesting an almost scientific approach to his subjects.

It was premiered at the Antwerp Flemish Opera in 1920, but was never performed since. The essence of The Children of the Sea is featured on this album.

The vast majority of the 51 he published were written as an homage to and reminder of his homeland, which he never saw again after the Russian occupation of 1830/31. The mazurka is an eastern European folk dance in triple time that originates from the Polish province of Masovia, where Chopin grew up. In many cases, a mazurka comprises various individual sections, the names of which are nearly always derived from a region or ethnic group. One such section is the polonez, which is rhythmically related to the ceremonious polonaise. Quite interestingly, Beethoven named the third movement of his Triple Concerto op. 56 Rondo alla polacca. The mazur has a rhythmic structure underpinned by numerous dotted figures or triplets. The kujawiak is a slow-flowing folk dance in triple metre. The krakowiak is characterised by much syncopation. The oberek is a feisty dance. Chopin wrote in total 13 cycles of mazurkas.

Already at the age of four to five, my Father and his brothers began to learn the essentials of the art of singing under my grandfather David’s solid guidance.” Utilizing David Bjorling’s singing technique, Lars brilliantly presents here a wide array of opera works and art songs.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=CDA1822,01 Classical,Classical,Vocal,United Kingdom,2017 Sterling Records,2017 Sterling Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

That puts him in a position to provide the individual members of the orchestra with helpful advice, which-nowadays- hardly any conductor is able to do. As these qualities go along with striving for the ideal, a rare capacity for enthusiasm as well as with an iron will he does not hesitate to impose, Hans Rosbaud is an inestimable and somehow indispensable institution.” (Bernhard Sekles, Rosbaud’s former professor of composition) This release is the fourth from SWR Classic focusing on the work of German conductor Hans Rosbaud.

Yet he not only impressed with works by Franz Liszt and related virtuoso composers. In 1927, he was the first pianist to record all 24 etudes Opp. 10 and 25 by Frederic Chopin. Still admired today, this documents his superb technique and simultaneously his temperament with its almost ebullient willingness to share. In the present documentation, we have the E flat Major concerto Op. 73 with the Stuttgart Radio Symphony Orchestra conducted by Joseph Keilberth in palpable accordance with the clear and clarified desires and wishes of the soloist. In respect, this recording is not only a confirmation of Backhaus as an absolute authority for the E flat Major, but also a clarion call in regards to Keilberth.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=SWR19057CD,01 Classical,Classical,,Germany,"1953, 1959, 1962 SWR Media Service GmbH",2018 Naxos Deutschland GmbH,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They are stylistically not only out of the ordinary, they also manage to bring large orchestras to perform artistically at high voltage, with an energy and at a creative level which is otherwise known only in much smaller ensembles. It is not the music alone that drives the participants, but rather the serene seriousness of a band leader who demands a maximum of intensity from her compositions and passes this premise on to their interpretation. It is impossible to conceive of compositions for jazz orchestras more stringently. The instrumentalists know this too, and therefore feel called upon not only to reproduce the charts accurately but to work out all the contained hints, implications, and visions of sound down to the deepest levels. This original recording was made in May 2000 when Schneider appeared alongside the SWR Big Band. And for the SWR Big Band, those days in May 2000 are some of the highlights of their orchestral history.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=JAH-469,02 Jazz,Jazz,,Germany,2000 SWR,2018 Naxos Deutschland GmbH,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rolla is hired as conductor by the Viceroy of France from 1805 to 1835; his music captures the peculiarities of the historical moment: the heroic, patriotic sentiment of a newborn homeland, the Mitteleuropean harmonic elegance, and the Italian belcanto. On the other side the surprising talent of Marianna Bottini is revealed by her intense compositional activity in the years between 1815 (when she was just 13 years old) and 1823, the year of her wedding; all her compositions have certainly been performed as evidenced by the existence of detached parts and evident traces of use on them. The soloists Remo Pieri (clarinet), Gianni Bicchierini (piano) and Tommaso Valenti (viola), accompanied by the orchestra of the “Luigi Boccherini” Institute of Lucca conducted by Gianpaolo Mazzoli, within this album are performing the concerts for soloist and orchestra by the two composers.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=TC800008,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Chamber Music,Austria,2018 Tactus Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Especially during the fusion boom of the 1970s, many expected the near demise of the unwieldy instrument that was patented in 1934. Gunter Kuhlwein, however, never believed in the fall of the electro-mechanical monster and has been working on the continued existence of “the Beast” (Jimmy Smith). Ever since he moved from the Hessian Viernheim to Switzerland, he has been teaching at the Swiss Jazz School and the Hochschule der Kunste Bern. When he was planning this recording, Kuhlwein chose partners whose merits and preferences he knew from countless earlier projects and performances. Opener and title track of this album is Seven Gates, like all other tracks an original composition by Kuhlwein.

The soprano Caroline Jahns and pianist Hedayet Jonas Djeddikar have intensively worked on these gems by Vesque and derived much pleasure from fathoming out the humor of this music for voice and piano. Both artists are united by a passion for the charm and delights hidden in the familiar circles of the Romantic art song. Unfortunately, developments in society toward the end of the 19th century heralded the decline of the salons and, with them, the audiences that relished Johann Vesque von Puttlingen’s satirical songs. So it is now our job to rediscover and appreciate the value of these rare works. The songs on this album present a composer who stands out from the multitude of song composers as one of the all-time greats.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=CTH2643,01 Classical,Classical,,Germany,2018 BELLA MUSICA,2018 BELLA MUSICA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

From the early sound tapestries of minimalists Philip Glass and John Adams, via David Lang and Arvo Part who combine repetition with melody and harmonic colors, to the atmospheric and quiet worlds of Ryuichi Sakamoto, Max Richter and Nils Frahm, what captivates the listener on these recordings is a sense of ambience, an evocation of space. Feico Deutekom breathes life and shape into these works, many of which have a delicately melancholy tone. He is able to convey both the rhythmic complexity and the panoramic quality of this music, where silence and the spaces lingering between the notes are often as important as the notes themselves. This release includes the world premiere recording of Philip Glass’s Mishima Sonata, an arrangement that Feico Deutekom made with permission of the composer of three movements from the movie soundtrack of Mishima, originally composed for strings.",https://youtu.be/__ixBJBvLgo,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=ZEF9654,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Minimalism,Netherlands,2018 Zefir Records,2018 Zefir Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
