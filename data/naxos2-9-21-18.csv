2018,Wiener Symphoniker,WS015,4260313960156,Ludwig van Beethoven ,Beethoven: Symphonies Nos. 2 & 7,Wiener Symphoniker,1,CD,14.81,22.99,"The first two releases in the Wiener Symphoniker's first full recorded Beethoven's symphony cycle met with universal acclaim from critics and audiences alike. Now the third part, in the form of Symphonies Nos. 2 and 7, is being released. The album is part of the Wiener Symphoniker's Road to Beethoven, a project to prepare for the year 2020, the 250th anniversary of the composer, a towering father-figure for classical music. With this new release, the Wiener Symphoniker are hoping to follow up on the great success of their first two albums in the cycle. Both the first release with Symphonies Nos. 1 and 3 and the second with Nos. 4 and 5 have been picked as "album of the month" by various international music magazines. Based on these releases, the British Gramophone magazine nominated the orchestra for "Orchestra of the Year 2018". In particular, the magazine praised Jordan's approach of combining the classic Viennese sound with a more modern, leaner interpretation, original tempos and insights from historically informed performance. For Jordan, the content of the music was paramount. His goal was not to revere Beethoven as a monument but rather to present him in a more "natural, direct and personal" way.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=WS015&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Orchestral,Austria,2018 Wiener Symphoniker,2018 Wiener Symphoniker,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He started learning piano at the age of six and won several regional piano competitions at a young age. He studied in Russia, Germany, and in the UK. As a soloist with orchestra, he has recently performed with Musikkollegium Winterthur, the London Soloists Chamber Orchestra, RNCM Concert Orchestra, the Gregorian Philharmonic Orchestra and with the Gulbenkian Symphony Orchestra. Mikhail lives in London and plays mostly in the UK and Europe. He is interested in historical performance practice and often gives recitals on fortepianos. The choice of instrument for this recording is the result of Mikhail's personal fascination with the spirit of fin de siï¿½cle, that period when so many musical styles emerged, coexisted, fused and challenged each other. It was an era in which the art of piano playing truly blossomed, and fortunately for us, the newly emerged recording technology documented and preserved this blossoming. The works on this release (with the exception of Mompou's Variations) were composed around the time this particular Bechstein was being built. So the pianistic sound worlds of Debussy, Ravel, Scriabin and Mompou are reflected in the sound world of this, their contemporary instrument.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=WHR054&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Piano,United Kingdom,2018 Willowhayne Records,2018 Willowhayne Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2018,Zefir Records,ZEF9657,8717774570517,Dick Kattenburg; Dmitri Shostakovich; Max Vredenburg; Mieczyslaw Weinberg ,Asdis Valdimarsdottir: Voice of the Viola in Times of Oppression,Asdis Valdimarsdottir; Marcel Worms ,1,CD,14.81,22.99,"The viola is surely not the most assertive instrument among the string family. It reaches neither the extreme height of the violin nor the rumbling depth and the strength of the cello and contrabass. Its role is more integrating than leading or polarizing; and in brilliance, maneuverability and sound projection the violin wins hands down. But if a composer wants to express his feelings with maximum intensity and depth, he chooses the viola remarkably often. The loss of a loved one, a repressive political system, persecution and war were more than once the motivation for the composing of music with the viola as the most important voice for expressing the underlying emotions. The dark, somewhat veiled sound of the instrument makes it particularly suited to such a role. The Polish-Russian Jewish composer Mieczyslaw Weinberg fled during the Nazi invasion. Dick Kattenburg was picked up in 1944 during a razzia and he died, only 24 years old, in Auschwitz. Max Vredenburg, being a Jewish artist, fled from the Nazis in 1941 to Indonesia but was there interned in a camp. Shostakovich's Sonata for viola and piano was his last composition. Notwithstanding that the pressures of the Soviet regime on the composer did not lead to his banishment or even his liquidation, the last stages of Shostakovich's life were far from uncomplicated. In all of these works, we see the viola utilized as the outlet of their suffering.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=ZEF9657&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Instrumental,Netherlands,2018 Zefir Records,2018 Zefir Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2018,Zefir Records,ZEF9659,8717774570531,Robert Schumann ,""...und ein Kuss auf dein Herz" - Myrten, Op. 25 & 4 Duets by Robert Schumann",Florieke Beelen; Hans Pieter Herman; Maurice Lammerts van Bueren ,1,CD,14.81,22.99,"Schumann wrote 26 songs and called them "Myrten," which means "Myrtles," as a wedding gift to Clara Wieck. Schumann, who grew up between piles of books in his father's bookstore, had developed a diverse taste in literature, and in Myrten his choice of poetry is not only adventurous, but above all remarkable. All texts of the cycle are in German, but three of the poets are English, Scottish or Irish: Lord Byron, Robert Burns, and Thomas Moore. Most English texts Schumann used for his Myrten were translated by Wilhelm Gerhard, a German salesman and poet, who lived in Leipzig and was friendly with many leading poets and composers. The other poems are written by Goethe, Ruckert and Heine, who are each represented in several songs. Only one text, which inspired Schumann to write one of his most beloved songs, was written by Julius Mosen: Der Nussbaum.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGOJVMR7t1E,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=ZEF9659&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Vocal,Netherlands,2018 Zefir Records,2018 Zefir Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
