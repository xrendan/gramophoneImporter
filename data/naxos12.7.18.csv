Jascha Heifetz's transcriptions of two numbers from the ballet Gayaneh were once ubiquitous, and David Oistrakh was the first champion of both Aram Khachaturian's Violin Concerto, and Karen Khachaturian's Violin Sonata. The Armenian-born Ruben Kosemyan follows in these distinguished footsteps with an urgent, lyrical strain of expression that has won him much acclaim both in Europe and in Canada where he now resides. In 2007 he was awarded a UNESCO gold medal by the Composers Union of Armenia on the occasion of the centenary of Aram Khachaturian's birth, and in 2009 he became leader of the Khachaturian State Quartet. Kosemyan is thus a uniquely well-qualified modern exponent of this music on record. As Karen's Op.1, the Violin Sonata of 1947 is a remarkably assured work, cast in a Romantic vein with a soulful slow movement and a dance-like finale full of potent rhythmic drive. His father wrote no violin sonata, but Kosemyan complements the famous 'Sabre Dance' and 'Ayesha's Dance' with his own transcription of a Song Poem, and a version of the voluptuous Adagio from Spartacus made by Henrik Smbatyan. To conclude the album, Kosemyan plays the rapturous slow movement from the Violin Concerto: "I wrote the music as though on a wave of happiness," Khachaturian recalled. "My whole being was in a state of joy, for I was awaiting the birth of my son. And this feeling, this love of life, was transmitted to the music."",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=BRI95357&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Germany,2018 Brilliant Classics,2018 Brilliant Classics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two further radio operas were comparative failures but it was with The Medium that Menotti really hit his stride. A tragedy in two acts for five singers, a dance-mime role and a chamber orchestra of 14 players, Menotti's opera is both dramatically astute in the Puccini tradition and composed with an acute ear for mood and mystery: the score, often quite dissonant, conveys an eerie, morbid atmosphere. According to the composer, "The Medium is actually a play of ideas. It describes the tragedy of a woman caught between two worlds, a world of reality which she cannot wholly comprehend, and a supernatural world in which she cannot believe." Premiered in 1945, The Medium received its first Broadway staging two years later, with a hugely successful a run of 212 performances at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre on Broadway. As a curtain-raiser for these performances (and a striking contrast), Menotti wrote a light one-act comedy in the opera buffa tradition, The Telephone, which he sub-titled L'amour à trois. The opera's central role of Lucy became a huge success for its first interpreter, Marilyn Cotlow, and now the young American soprano Elizabeth Hertzberg steps into her shoes with an assured portrayal. Made under studio conditions in Modena in 2018, these recordings took place in association with semi-staged performances given by artists on the distinguished Raina Kabaivanska Masterclass programme. According to the Giornale della Musica, Hertzberg was 'excellent' as Lucy, and more critical praise was directed towards the fluent and insightful conducting of Scogna. There are comparatively few modern recordings to rival the classic 1947 recording; an essential acquisition for avid listeners of 20th century music theatre.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=BRI95361&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Germany,2018 Brilliant Classics,2018 Brilliant Classics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The piano-accompanied sonatas are relatively well-known, so too the Trauermusik composed in a single evening to mark the death of King George V. The solo viola works have had less attention: Hindemith referred to them as Gebrauchsmusik, by which he meant compositions with simple, linear structures, often intended for amateur players: music that responded to a particular need or use. Their language owes something to the solo viola music by Max Reger, with which Hindemith was certainly familiar. However, Hindemith could draw on both greater individuality as a melodist as well as his own considerable skills as a violist to inform his idiomatic writing for the instrument. Op.11 No.5 (1919) has a Classical structure in four movements, concluding with a noble passacaglia: the work of a gifted 24-year-old who is still establishing his own path within the wider context of musical tradition. Op.25 No.1 belongs to Hindemith's Neoclassical period: spiky and witty with a whirlwind finale. Composed in 1923, the Sonata Op.31 No.4 evolves in more traditional fashion, from a perpetuum mobile opening movement to a grave but not melancholy song, followed by a theme-and-variation finale. The 1937 Sonata is much more searching and chromatic, doubtless reflecting its troubled times, and notably exploiting contrasts of sound and silence. Luca Ranieri is among Italy's most distinguished violists, having been conducted as a soloist by the likes of Mehta, Giulini and Sinopoli. His many recordings include the Cello Suites of Bach arranged for viola: "Ranieri plays with elegance and clean articulation, and his tone is clear."

The four sonatas on this release all come from different periods: The earliest (Op.5 No.3 in A flat) dates back to 1788, the threshold of the French Revolution, while the last (Op.61 in F sharp minor) was composed in 1807, in the midst of the turmoil of the Napoleonic Wars. The B flat major Sonata Op.24 reflects Dussek's time in London, and Op.43 in A major the period of his hasty departure from London, abandoning his young wife in London and fleeing to Hamburg to avoid his creditors, notably including Lorenzo da Ponte. In the sonatas from Op.24 onwards Dussek richly exploits the colorful sonorities of then-new-five-and-a-half-octave Broadwood grand, mingling flamboyant virtuosity and explosive rhetoric with a rhapsodic expansiveness and harmonic side-slips that foreshadow Schubert. The music is tautly structured and passionately argued, with richly imaginative textures and a subtle use of chromaticism for poignant effect. On this latest installment in a projected complete set of the sonatas, each album performed by a different pianist specializing in music of the Classical era, the Finnish pianist Tuija Hakkila plays two instruments: a Viennese five-octave instrument of anonymous manufacture dating from around 1800, and a modern copy of a Longman Clementi fortepiano (London, 1799) made by Chris Maene. Both pianos are ideally suited to the drama, virtuoso brilliance and often deep, rich sonorities of these sonatas.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=BRI95604&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Germany,2018 Brilliant Classics,2018 Brilliant Classics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As both a virtuoso violinist and composer, he was a product of his time and place, working in a musical culture dominated by opera. His 'Dance of the Goblins' has long been a mainstay of the recital repertoire for violinists seeking to send their audiences on their way with gasps of astonishment, but his transcriptions are much more developed and extensive pieces. They rework not only some of the defining passages of 19th-century Italian opera, but many themes and arias that are now less familiar. Bazzini found in the operas of Bellini a particularly fruitful source of inspiration, writing no fewer than three separate fantasias on themes from La sonnambula through the course of his career, as well as pieces based on Norma, I puritani, La straniera, Beatrice di Tenda, Il pirata and (when he was just 16 years old) I Capuleti e i Montecchi: an astonishingly vivid and precocious piece of work, handled here with sovereign mastery by the young Romanian violinist Anca Vasile Caraman. Accompanied here by the Mantovan-born pianist Alessandro Trebeschi, Caraman is equally impressive in Bazzini's extended, improvisatory reworkings of climactic moments in Lucia di Lammermoor and Anna Bolena by Donizetti. Having taken a cold attitude towards the young Verdi, Bazzini was later won over by the genius of La traviata, which resulted in a truly concerto-like fantasia as well as no less technically demanding fantasias on Attila and I masnadieri. In these works, as in the three fantasies on themes from Pacini's Saffo, Bazzini emulates Franz Liszt in venturing far beyond literal fidelity to the notes, towards an expressive fidelity to the original dramas.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=BRI95674&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Germany,2018 Brilliant Classics,2018 Brilliant Classics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2018,Brilliant Classics,BRI95741,5028421957418,Claude Debussy ,Debussy: Melodies,Lorna Windsor; Antonio Ballista ,2,CD,9.35,14.99,"Debussy wrote songs throughout his career, beginning at the age of 18 with Nuit d'étoiles, with which this collection also begins. Most of his vocal output was inspired by the singers he encountered as a young man in the fashionable salons of fin-de-siecle Paris, and in particular the soprano Blanche Vasnier: from that time, Debussy's songs resembled an amorous diary of dreams and desires of infinite sweetness, entrusted to a voice capable of the utmost seduction. The epilogue to his love story with Vasnier is heard in Apparition, after which Lorna Windsor moves to the years of Debussy in Rome, and in particular his sumptuous settings of Baudelaire. There follow the much more elusive settings of Verlaine and Rimbaud, dating from his 'impressionist' and even 'post-impressionist' late years, and often inspired by his encounter with the soprano Mary Garden, the first Mélisande. Lorna Windsor has established a reputation as a specialist in contemporary music: her catalogue on Brilliant Classics includes the songs with piano by John Cage (8850) and a more recent, wide-ranging album of solo-vocal music by Feldman, Kagel, Kurtág and others. She also has considerable experience in French repertoire, having studied with the doyen of French baritones, Gérard Souzay, and given performances in France of Offenbach and Satie, as well as recording the songs of Satie. A further point of interest to the album concerns the piano used by Antonio Ballista: a 1923 Pleyel. Ballista himself was born just 13 years after the piano was made, and for more than half a century he formed half of one of the best-known and most recorded piano duos of their time, in partnership with fellow Italian Bruno Canino. Though he has accompanied many eminent singers such as Cathy Berberian, Anna Caterina Antonacci and Kim Criswell, his work with singers has been very rarely represented on record, making this album a collector's item in Ballista's distinguished career as well as a ravishingly idiomatic record of French song.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=BRI95741&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Germany,2018 Brilliant Classics,2018 Brilliant Classics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Though many have only recently enjoyed a revival, they were widely admired in his day. Cimarosa specialised in comedies, the form known as opera buffa, and his greatest achievement, Il matrimonio segreto, represents the pinnacle of the genre and would influence his contemporaries and generations of composers to come. L'impresario in angustie (The Ruined Impresario), a one-act farce from earlier in his career, was also a resounding success, even capturing the imagination of that German literary giant Johann Wolfgang von Goethe when he saw it in Rome. Goethe would go on to join the many translators of the work who facilitated the opera's staging across Europe and its remarkable international popularity. An impresario and his cast and creative team are preparing a new opera for their theatre in Naples. The three leading ladies are each attempting to intervene with the impresario, the composer, and the poet in charge of the libretto, in order to secure for themselves the biggest role and best music in the new production. Each of divas, in turn, is the object of amorous attention from one of more of the creators. The impresario is bankrupt, however, and the work will never see the light of day.

He embodied the 18th-century homme du monde, and his music always reflects the conviviality and refined taste that permeated every aspect of the Parisian society of the time. This collection of Boismortier's chamber music opens with the Ballet de village in G Op.52 No.1, published in 1752. A traditional sequence of dance movements is treated in a subtle and charming manner and concluding with a flamboyant chaconne: a stunning example of the composer's refinement, grace and virtuoso writing for the flute which was his own instrument. This Italian early-music ensemble then explores a more Italian side to Boismortier's idiom with sonatas from the Opp. 34, 37 and 91 collections. They alternate with excerpts from the vividly pictorial Pièces de clavecin Op.59, which capture archetypes of contemporary French society with wit and even sympathy in works such as La Valétudinaire. The music fits perfectly under the fingers: for clarity, refinement and expressive power these pieces are comparable in form and inventiveness to the keyboard music of François Couperin. Also wholly French in idiom is the Suite in D Op.31 for viola da gamba and basso continuo: its flowing and sensuous cantabile style may even be heard as a homage to Marin Marais, who had died in 1728. This album is the latest in a series of critically acclaimed recordings made by the recorder and flute player and director Stefano Bagliano. Previous Brilliant Classics albums have included concertos and sonatas by Quantz, praised by MusicWeb International as "an excellent recording to become acquainted with Quantz...one might consider getting hold of other recordings of Bagliano after having been left spellbound by his rendering."",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=BRI95754&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Germany,2018 Brilliant Classics,2018 Brilliant Classics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many composers wrote for Heinrich, most notably Carl Maria von Weber, who composed his two concertos and chamber works with Heinrich in mind, impressed as he was by his 'homogeneity of tone from top to bottom'. Mendelssohn and Meyerbeer were among others who wrote for this 'Rubini of the clarinet', as he was known at the time. His son Carl was less talented as a soloist, though he accompanied his father on concert-tours playing the basset horn, and he turned both to teaching and to instrument-making: in 1860 he produced an 18-keyed Müller-type clarinet, which found favour with many players, including Richard Mühlfeld, for whom Brahms wrote several celebrated late works such as two sonatas and the Clarinet Quintet. Carl's own compositions run to 88 opus numbers in all, of which three are played here by the young Italian clarinettist Dario Zingales: two evocative tone-poems and the early but more extensive and demanding Fantasie brillante Op.7. These world premiere recordings are complemented by Carl's arrangements of six Schubert Lieder, including the evergreen Ave Maria, Gretchen am Spinnrade and Ständchen, in which the vocal line transfers beautifully to the solo instrument. Heinrich's own music is even less known but no less rewarding for collectors of little- known Romantic chamber music. Still unpublished, the Nocturne in F minor is as melodically memorable as it is superbly written for Baermann's own instrument. Dario Zingales presents its first recording here, as he does the Introduktion und Polonaise Op.25 and the sparkling Air Varié Op.12 No.2.

This remarkable set gathers together not only the monumental corpus of J.S. Bach's incredibly sophisticated organ music, but also that of the most noted (and best-known to today's musicologists) of four generations of his relatives, from great uncles and uncles to cousins and sons. The collection offers a rewarding opportunity to follow the stylistic evolution of organ music from the decades before J.S. Bach's birth through to the creative years of his sons and their younger distant cousin, Johann Ernst, each of whom witnessed the decline of Baroque complexity in favor of Classical balance and grace and conformed to this new trend to varying degrees. The other strand that can be traced in this set is the musical 'DNA' of a clan, whose members were taught by family elders, inherited compositions from them, and who studied and copied the works of their cousin contemporaries, creating a family school of impressive quality. Internal musical borrowing between the Bachs was such that musicologists are still unraveling the mystery of some works' true authorship, as well as identifying pieces by other composers, who borrowed the Bach name in hopes of attaining a share of their glory.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=BRI95803&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Germany,2018 Brilliant Classics,2018 Brilliant Classics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Colombano spent about two years there, during which he composed the Psalms for Six Voices (Harmonia super vespertinos omnium solemnitatum psalmos sex vocibus decantanda), his first work, which sets to music the Psalms of the Vespers liturgy for all obligatory feast days, as established at the Council of Trent, preceded by the introductory 'Deus in adjutorium' and followed by the Magnificat. The style is largely antiphonal, with alternating choirs in dialogue, and this collection presents as a kind of 'compendium' of the features of polyphonic psalms of the time: from homorhythm with rather strict syllabic declamation, to close imitative polyphony akin to Flemish models. This variety of approach gives insight into the structure of psalmodic recitation and its polyphonic treatment in the late 16th century. This world-premiere recording is based on the score edited by Denis Silano for the series 'Bibliotheca Musicalis Ecclesiae Vercellensis' published by Vox Antiqua. Monsignor Silano leads the Cappella Musicale of Vercelli Cathedral, whose elite ensemble aims to revive the Vercelli Cathedral's 16th- and 17th-century heritage of manuscripts and printed music.

Having written a part for the recorder virtuoso in his opera about the life and times of the philosopher Spinoza, Loevendie has proceeded to compose several other works which marry the Baroque idiom of the recorder's natural home with his own, jazz-inflected idiom. Most notable among them is the recorder concerto Nachklang, dedicated to Bosgraaf like several other works on the album. Bach's Brandenburg Concerto no. 3 is the origin of a sparkling composition for recorder, three violins, three violas, three cellos, double bass and harpsichord. Both musicians celebrate music as a vital, living language, both of them have an affinity with improvisation; Loevendie's musical roots lie in the jazz tradition, and the freewheeling nature of their partnership can be sampled live in an Amsterdam cafe where they regularly play jam sessions together with the violinist Oene van Geel. For this recording Loevendie, Bosgraaf and Van Geel headed for the studio, which resulted in four improvisations, each based on a passacaglia theme. Having been the intended soloist for Nachklang, Bosgraaf commissioned the solo Reflex from Loevendie, and this too works outwards from lively Baroque-era rhythmic impulses. Dance for Three is a composition which, in its original form for violin, dates from 1986. It is one of Loevendie's most frequently heard pieces.

They are notable for mellifluous themes, sophisticated structures and, at times, a lyricism that seems to foreshadow the youthful works of Schubert. This unique recording draws on the original sources and corrects a number of mistakes encountered in previously published versions. This second volume of the complete edition of the symphonies of Leopold Kozeluch follows a first that was released in March 2017 and given a 9/9 score by ClassicsToday.com with plaudits for both conductor and orchestra: "Marek Stilec leads lively, smartly paced performances, and gets fine playing from the ensemble."",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=8573872&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Germany,2018 Naxos Rights (Europe) Ltd,2018 Naxos Rights (Europe) Ltd,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

String Quintet No. 28, with an especially beautiful Adagio with more than a trace of the influence of Mendelssohn, combines Baroque poise with expressive Romantic writing, while String Quartet No. 29 is light-hearted and good-natured, with hints of Schubert in its melancholy lyricism and unexpected key changes. In praising the Elan Quintet's first volume, a MusicWeb International reviewer declared, "I cannot fault their playing: their tonal quality is ravishing, their ensemble perfect." The combination of string quartet with double bass has opened up a richness of tone and distinct soundscape that the Elan Quintet has dedicated itself to exploring, celebrating works by renowned composers such as Schubert, Dvorak, and Cambini, working with contemporary artists in creating new works for quintet, and rediscovering neglected masterpieces by composers including Onslow and Bridge.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=8573887&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Germany,2018 Naxos Rights (Europe) Ltd,2018 Naxos Rights (Europe) Ltd,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There are several settings of Marian antiphons- Latin hymns to the Virgin Mary- as well as settings of sacred poetry. Elements of the writing point to his operatic experience, with rich and varied use of accompanying winds, songlike themes, and a wide vocal range. Conductor Franz Hauk has been responsible for reestablishing the music of Johann Simon Mayr, one of the most significant operatic and vocal composers residing in Italy before the rise of Rossini.

This album reflects these changes. Haydn probably wrote the charming 5 Variationen in D major for the harpsichord around the mid-1759s while the Fantasia in C major, with abundant hand crossings and effects, was intended to exploit the particular sonority of the fortepiano. In 1792 he wrote new dances for a Viennese masked ball and the Empress herself asked for keyboard arrangements which Haydn provided in the shape of the sparkling Deutsche Tanze and Menuetti. Hungarian pianist Jeno Jando has won a number of piano competitions in Hungary and abroad, including first prize at the 1973 Hungarian Piano Concours and a First Prize in the chamber music category at the Sydney International Piano Competition in 1977.

Kierkegaard examines the biblical story of Abraham, instructed to sacrifice his son Isaac, and forces us to consider Abraham's state of mind. What drove Abraham, and what made him carry out such an absurd and extreme request from God? Kierkegaard argues that Abraham's agreement to sacrifice Isaac, and his suspension of reason, elevated him to the highest level of faith. He explores more comprehensible alternatives, but in each one Abraham fails the test of faith, thus showing that true faith cannot be explained, understood, or made rational. His thesis is a compelling counterpoint to Hegel, who maintained that reason was the highest form of thought, and proved a significant source of inspiration to later existentialist philosophers such as Camus and Sartre.",https://soundcloud.com/naxos-audiobooks /fear,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=NA0327&medium=phy,15 Spoken Word,Spoken Word,United Kingdom,2018 Naxos AudioBooks,2018 Naxos AudioBooks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thesiger documents the tribes' conflicts, traditions, cuisine, relationships, justice systems and art, and reveals how they built their unique water-borne society, with its beautiful canoes (taradas) and stately guest houses (mudhifs) - it is a remarkable familiarity gained through Thesiger's innate understanding of tribal ritual and etiquette, and the trust he earned through the use of a basic medical supply kit that he brought along with him.

There is suffering and squalor: criminal gangs are on the rise, along with typhus and black market commerce, and the female population is forced into part-time prostitution, simply to obtain food. Corruption is rife as a Genovese crime family member makes his way into the US army administration, and local hospitals, short on supplies, buy equipment back from those who stole it. There is farce and humor too, witnessed in the Roman uncle paid handsomely to simply appear at funerals and lend an air of gravitas, and in Lewis's own experience of vetting proposed marriages between British soldiers and local women.

Following that particular competition success (one of many, including the Sydney International Piano Competition in 2016), Gugnin recorded Pictures at an Exhibition, which has become a tour de force for Gugnin on recent tours of Europe, America and Asia. Glenn Gould, Emil Gilels and Sergei Rachmaninov are Gugnin's 'piano heroes': the last two noted exponents of Franz Liszt in their own right, and among the composer's vast output, still only a fraction of which is generally known, the Transcendental Etudes are the pre-eminent works to embody the contradictions and contrasts at the heart of the man and his music: 'transcendent' both in terms of the demands they make upon the performer and yet, at points, in their spiritual aspirations. 'Half Franciscan, half gypsy' was Liszt's own description of himself, not entirely ironic, and it chimes with the extraordinary variety of these studies, encapsulated by the expressive distance between the last two, the visionary 'Harmonies du soir' and the unstoppable force of 'Chasse-Neige': 'a sublime and steady fall of snow which gradually buries landscape and people' according to Ferruccio Busoni. In Andrey Gugnin these studies find a pianist with both the technique and the sensibility to encompass the precipitous leaps of 'Wilde Jagd' and the Mendelssohnian eye for landscape in 'Paysage'.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=PCL10158&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Germany,2018 Piano Classics,2018 Piano Classics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Viner has now made his own selection from the hundreds of piano pieces, some light, others more serious, composed by Cécile Chaminade (1857-1944). Periodically revived in tokenistic ways, Chaminade's output is now being seen in the round, and it reveals a voice of not only feminine delicacy and charm, but also a melodist of refinement whose gift for a well-turned tune never left her in a career spanning over six decades. The Pierrette, air de ballet Op.41 may be an attractive trifle, but the Six Etudes de concert present a stiffer challenge for the pianist: the first of them, 'Automne', was one of her best-loved pieces at a time when her music was ubiquitous in the smart salons of Europe. The brief Les Sylvains gives the impression of having been conceived at a single sitting, so engaging is its suggestive portrait of wood-nymphs. Once described as 'nearly a genius who knew what and how to write for pianists of moderate ability,' Chaminade produced countless miniatures of gentle pleasures such as La Lisonjera Op.50, the Arabesque Op.61 and the Songs without Words Op.76. However, the four-movement Poème provençal Op.127 is far more substantial: 'among Chaminade's most inspired final productions' according to Viner in his invaluable booklet essay. His survey concludes with the scintillating Thème varié Op.89 which, like several other works on this album has previously received very few recordings.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=PCL10164&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Germany,2018 Piano Classics,2018 Piano Classics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
