Maalismaa and Holmström have worked as a duo since 2011. They are co-directors of both the Ristiveto Festival, which specializes in performing late 19th-century music on period instruments, and the Classical Hietsu concert series in Helsinki. Finnish violinist Eriikka Maalismaa plays in a variety of ensembles and collectives and visits frequently as leader of orchestras. She is fascinated by saying Yes to things that scare her. Performing music of our time as well as collaborating with composers is one of her biggest interests. She finds it a musician's duty and a privilege. As a quite natural part of the profession, Eriikka loves setting her violin up with raw gut strings and finding sounds and colors that are no longer available to listeners of modern-day instrumentalism. Emil Holmström has performed as a soloist, chamber musician, and ensemble keyboard player throughout Europe, the Americas, Japan, and Australia. He appears frequently at Finnish music festivals and concert series and has been a featured soloist with the Finnish Radio Symphony Orchestra, the Lapland Chamber Orchestra, and the Lahti Symphony Orchestra. An ardent champion of new music, Holmström is a member Finnish groups defunensemble, the Uusinta Ensemble, and the Tristero Piano Trio, and plays as a regular guest with the Avanti!

For decades after his death his reputation remained that of a lightweight, humorous composer, although more recently attention has been paid to his serious works including chamber music, choral music and opera. Jack Mattsson was a Finnish church musician, conductor and flautist from Åland. His easily accessible music has gained great popularity amongst a broad range of listeners. Although primarily known for his choral compositions, Niels Burgmann also composes chamber music and solo works. His music is characterized by an interest in the exploration of timbre, combined with a profound feeling for melody. Also originating from Åland, Lars Karlsson is one of the most renowned living Finnish composers. For many years he taught composition and music theory at the Sibelius- Academy in Helsinki. His oeuvre contains chamber music, works for organ, two symphonies and the opera Rödhamn. The French organist and composer Jehan Ariste Alain was born into a family of musicians - his father and siblings were pianists and organists. He was influenced by both the French musical scene of the time, and by his interest in the music and philosophy of the Far East. As such he is sometimes considered an oddity amongst French composers.

Composed over a period of forty-six years (between 1875 and 1821), they bear witness to the composer's remarkable stylistic evolution. From a form of expression rooted in romanticism, to an aesthetic fully aligned with 20th-century modernity, Fauré can be said to have shaped his musical personality like a sculptor. His Nocturnes are not all of equal importance, but as a whole their diversity and development offer a perfect panorama of his art.

Through these preludes and fugues, she reminds us that far from being technical exercises, the Well- Tempered Clavier is a work of pure pleasure and constant renewed discovery.

Instead it is an important record, dedicated to a monumental figure of 17th century music... The wide range of expressive possibilities in these works is fully explored, developed well beyond a simple reading... Hats off to Maurizio Schiavo and the excellent vocal soloists who joined him in this fine production.' On their latest album, Schiavo and his ensemble dedicate their energies to the 18th-century virtuoso and composer, born on the coast of what is now Slovenia, who became a reference point for violin-playing in Venice, in Padua and then across Europe. The four-part sonatas and sinfonias for strings gathered here may not have been 'chamber music' in the pure sense of the term as we understand it today, but these highly attractive works certainly played a seminal role in the development of the genre before it was crystallized by Haydn and Boccherini in the form of the string quartet. Some of the sonatas are recorded with basso continuo in the Baroque style, some without; all of them have a lively, galant style, abounding in the kind of elaborate violin figurations that made Tartini famous with his 'Devil's Trill' Sonata. There are close-knit dialogues and intricate imitations as well as gravely beautiful slow movements; anyone who wishes to join the dots between Bach and Haydn will delight in the scholarly and stylish work of Il Demetrio.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=BRI95398&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Germany,2019 Brilliant Classics,2019 Brilliant Classics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He died as master of music at the ducal palace of Genoa, an eminent role he had held for a decade. Born into a musical family, he trained as a church musician and took vows in the early stages of priesthood before begin dismissed in 1616 as Chapel Master of music at the Cathedral in Genoa, having the previous year married into local aristocracy. All the while he continued to play, to teach and to compose on his principal instrument, the theorbo. This book of dances, fantasias and intabulations was published in 1599 and it demonstrates a comprehensive knowledge of the instrument and its repertoire. The rich and challenging chords and fingerings demonstrate Molinaro's own virtuosity as a performer. There is something quintessentially noble about Molinaro's work as a composer. Although his idiom is that of the Renaissance, his musical ideas reveal the sort of horizontal, linear development that owes much to Flemish counterpoint. In Ugo Nastrucci's careful ordering of the volume, moments of strict counterpoint alternate with lighter virtuoso variations in the extended passamezzi which contrast with elegant galliards and sprightly saltarellos. Nastrucci closes the album with what is probably Molinaro's most famous piece, the Ballo detto il Conte Orlando which was transcribed over a century ago in modern notation by Oscar Chilesotti, and rearranged by Ottorino Respighi in the first suite of his Antiche arie e danze of 1917.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=BRI95401&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Germany,2019 Brilliant Classics,2019 Brilliant Classics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Afforded the opportunity to exercise his perfoming skills and creative imagination upon a particularly impressive example of contemporary Italian organ building, installed nine years previously by the firm of Camillo Guglielmo Bianchi, Pelazza composed most of the works on this album for use during and after services in the church. He later moved to Marseilles, and then in 1898 emigrated to Buenos Aires, becoming chapel master to a church which served the local Italian community. He died there in 1936, having thoroughly reformed and improved the standard of sacred music performance in the city. As a church and instrumental composer Pelazza was more original than most of his local contemporaries. The collection of 12 Suonate su varii tuoni demonstrates a reduction in the hitherto dominant influence of Rossini and the bel canto tradition upon non-vocal Italian music, and at the same time an awareness of the organ's potential as a symphonic instrument. The collection opens in the grand manner with a majestic Allegro sinfonico and thereafter supplies voluntaries for use during and after the Mass, including a solemn Adagio per l'Elevazione and a fun Polka-finale. Making his debut on Brilliant Classics, Fabio Macera has also chosen extracts from Organ Masses in C and D major by Pelazza, and three further sonatas written for the feast of the Holy Sacrament. On this new recording he plays a stylistically appropriate organ built in 1821 by the Serassi firm for the Parish Church of St Bartholomew in Borzonasca, near Genoa.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=BRI95516&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Germany,2019 Brilliant Classics,2019 Brilliant Classics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The practice of writing studies for the perfection of a particular pianistic technique developed in the 15th century, but the name 'study' or 'étude' only really came into its own in the 19th century with the rise in popularity of the piano as a domestic instrument. Works of particular importance were Clementi's Gradus ad Parnassum, Moscheles's Opus 70 Studies, Czerny's Art of Finger Dexterity and Liszt's Transcendental Studies, the latter even more extensive and complex than Chopin's Études Opp. 10 and 25, which transformed the humble piano exercise into concert-worthy material. While each of Liszt's and Chopin's études examines a particular aspect of technique, these magnificent works never feel like drills. They remain amongst the most popular works written for piano, regularly recorded and performed in concert. In the 20th century, studies gradually evolved into compositions that were music first, only secondarily exploiting a specific technical challenge for the pianist. Notable composers were Claude Debussy, Sergei Rachmaninov, Alexander Scriabin and Leopold Godowsky. Godowsky's Chopin Studies push fingers and feet, mind and imagination, physicality and finesse, fitness, to the outer limits of possibility. By mid-century composers had almost completely abandoned the old tradition. Olivier Messiaen's 4 Études de rhythme are not didactic compositions but experiments with dynamics, figurations, pitches, etc. - exercises in composition rather than performance. Friedrich Gulda intended his Play Piano Play as exercises in learning the jazz style and improvisation, contrasting traditional neo-Baroque with various jazz traditions. Philip Glass abandoned bar lines to convey his concept of the flow of rhythm, and John Cage's Études Boreales, initially deemed unplayable because of the wholly unorthodox techniques they explore, require the performer to play, beat or generate sound on various parts of the instrument. These studies represent some of the most innovative and imaginative writing in the modern and contemporary piano repertoire, exploring to the fullest extent what the instrument is capable of.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=BRI95571&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Germany,2019 Brilliant Classics,2019 Brilliant Classics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2019,Brilliant Classics,BRI95661,5028421956619,Claudio Monteverdi ,Monteverdi: Madrigali Libri I-IX (Complete Madrigals),Le Nuove Musiche; Krijn Koetsveld,12,CD,36.65,56.99,"The Dutch musician Krijn Koetsveld has often conducted Bach, and he was founder-director of The Netherlands Bach Ensemble. However, it is the name of Claudio Monteverdi with which he is indelibly associated: he first encountered the composer's music in 1972, and describes it as 'love at first sight, which never passed'. This relationship matured over time into the foundation of a soloistic vocal group, Le Nuove Musiche, with the technical skills, the scholarly understanding and the musical sensitivities to do justice to the highly intimate, sophisticated genre of Renaissance madrigal, of which the nine books by Monteverdi represent its summit and fullest flowering. Recording all nine books, and several other mini-dramas and vocal chamber works which fall within the genre but outside the books themselves, began in 2004 and was only completed in 2018. Koetsveld contributes a lively and authoritative introduction to the whole project in the booklet. He remarks: 'Nine books of madrigals, all of them unique, contributing to the transition from the Renaissance to the baroque, a musical history in sound.' As the series has been released, its importance has been widely recognised in the critical press. In 2017, Fanfare observed: 'Il Combattimento di Tancredi e Clorinda is representative of Koetsveld's approach. The harmonic outline of the continuo is restrained and precise, the tutti playing of the strings articulated clearly. Both instrumental and concerted textures are so transparent one could take dictation to the recording. In a luminous performance as the narrator, Falco van Loon is focused and crystalline; Wendy Roobol is a clean, nimble Clorinda. Arnout Lems is the most dramatic of the soloists, voicing Tancredi in a rich but gentle baritone.'",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=BRI95661&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Germany,2019 Brilliant Classics,2019 Brilliant Classics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A single performance was given on 7 February 1901, after rehearsals of which Louÿs wrote: 'I'm spending every afternoon with naked women. It's nice.' The poems were spoofs on those by Sappho, supposedly a friend of the non-existent Bilitis, and a review praised the music as 'ingeniously archaic'. Debussy's scoring evokes the imagined sound of ancient Greece: the two flutes represent the aulos, associated with satyrs and the Dionysian cult; and the two harps speak for the kythara, associated with Apollo. Interwoven with the music is the bright sound of the celesta, the metal instrument patented by Auguste Mustel in 1886 that constitutes a meeting point between the Apollonian and the Dionysian. The missing celesta part of the incidental music, no doubt taken by Debussy himself, was recreated by Arthur Hoérée. In 1914 Debussy reworked passages of the music in his Épigraphes antiques for piano duet. Although the Chansons and the Epigraphes have often been recorded, they are very rarely recorded together with the incidental music, making this new album a uniquely cohesive and attractive album presenting Debussy at his most sensuous and Orientalist. There is a postlude to the album which continues its theme with Syrinx for solo flute, Debussy's dreamy evocation of the god Pan that also had its origins in music for the stage. Distinguished Italian musicians have joined forces to form the Magadis Ensemble. The ensemble's flexible line-up and wide repertoire focuses on vocal and instrumental chamber music by 20th- and 21st-century composers such as Debussy, Ravel, Dallapiccola and Scelsi.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=BRI95678&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Germany,2019 Brilliant Classics,2019 Brilliant Classics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The first was of guitar music by another relatively forgotten figure, Alexander Tansman, and it was enthusiastically reviewed by Classical Guitar magazine: 'Highly recommended!' Like Tansman, Carlevaro studied with Andres Segovia, the father of the modern guitar, during the 1930s. However, he broke away from his master's teachings in order to make his own experiments in both guitar manufacture and composition. His music caught the ear of Heitor Villa-Lobos, another South American innovator, and it embraces the widest stylistic range captured by Poli Cappelli on this album, from the delicate watercolours of the Preludios Americanos (1969-74) to the vivid brushstrokes and abstract form of Cronomias (1972). Carlevaro's later music returned often to the milonga, a tango-related dance popularised in the classical sphere by Astor Piazzolla. Milonga para Ling (1999) is brief but saturated with melancholy, while to the Milonga Oriental (1994) belongs one of the composer's happiest melodic inspirations. Later still, a pair of milonga suites describe a peaceful return to the composer's heritage. An essential acquisition for guitar aficionados, but also a collection of beautiful South American melodies that deserve to travel more widely.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=BRI95684&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Germany,2019 Brilliant Classics,2019 Brilliant Classics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The composers here recorded were at the forefront of the achievements of Neapolitan music in the first half of the 18th century, the golden age of music production in the southern Italian centre. And the Neapolitan style at this time was fashionable beyond the borders of Italy, as well. Among all the composers presented, only Mancini lived and worked almost all his life in Naples. The others spent their lives travelling or serving foreign courts. This programme exploits the felicitous pairing of the voice with flute, two instruments similarly tied to the expressivity of human breath. Throughout this programme a baroque transverse flute, or 'traverso', is used, either called for specifically or substituted for the recorder. When these pieces were written the two types of flute still existed alongside each other as equals, as they had done for centuries before the transverse variety began to dominate later in the 18th century. Use of the viola da gamba for the bass part also finds justification in Naples. While in Rome the instrument had almost completely disappeared by the first half of the 17th century, it endured in Naples and continued to be used. Several mid-18th-century viole da gamba, preserved to this day, in various sizes by luthiers from the Neapolitan Gaglian family attest to the much later persistence of this instrument in that area.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=BRI95778&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Germany,2019 Brilliant Classics,2019 Brilliant Classics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was with the sonatas on this album that the cello first sang with its own true voice. Gabrielli and Jacchini celebrated the nimble and athletic character of the instrument, in music that leaps and dances as much as it sings. Several previous albums on Brilliant Classics have demonstrated the stylish feeling and polished technique of Ensemble Cordia in Baroque and early-Classical-era chamber music. Their album of chamber music by Platti received rave reviews: 'Platti here receives authoritative interpretations by some of the greatest players in the business. If you want to get acquainted with Platti's music - and there is every reason to - this album is the best possible way to start.' The ensemble's recording of string trios by Anton Wranitzky was similarly welcomed by MusicWeb International: 'A well-judged recording, allied to stylistically apt performances.' The discography of this north-Italian chamber group also includes Telemann, a collection of 'Passionate Baroque Arias' and more Platti, an album of cello concertos with the ensemble's director Stefano Veggetti as soloist: 'These are all really interesting and worthwhile works... enhanced by the excellent playing of soloist Veggetti, who handles both the lyrical parts with a singing tone and the sometimes fiendish virtuosity of the bookended movements with ease and grace..'

It was Beethoven's far more renowned teacher, Christian Gottlob Neefe, who wrote a biography of Luchesi and described his early training in music at home, then his move to Venice, and his early success as an opera composer. As a keyboard player and member of a Venetian opera company, Luchesi travelled to Germany in 1771 and made his career there, being appointed the Kapellmeister to the Prince Elector's court in Bonn as successor to Beethoven's grandfather. He attracted favourable mention in the journals of the English musical commentator and traveller Charles Burney, and the piano-maker JB Cramer also praised him as one of the best Italian composers of his day as well as an excellent organist. There have even been far-fetched claims that Luchesi was the true author of some of Mozart's best-known works! The six sonatas recorded here and published in Bonn in 1772 as Luchesi's Opus 1 were originally designated as sonatas for the harpsichord with violin accompaniment, much in the style of violin sonatas by Mozart and Beethoven. Luchesi, however, reduced the violin part to a marginal role, mostly doubling the keyboard's right-hand part; Roberto Plano has accordingly eliminated it altogether in this recording, saying that 'I believe it to be closer to the composer's original intention.'",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=BRI95811&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Germany,2019 Brilliant Classics,2019 Brilliant Classics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

From start to finish, this finely polished score, with its astonishing orchestration, is full of spectacular effects that clearly look forward to Les Troyens of Berlioz.

This stage is incredibly special to Lea, as it is where, at age 7, she made her performance debut as a member of the company of The King and I and, at age 18, she first sang the song "I'd Give My Life for You" in public, just prior to leaving for London in 1989 to take on the role of Kim in the West End production of 'Miss Saigon'. Of this performance with the BYU Chamber Orchestra, Lea writes: ""This collaboration with the BYU Chamber Orchestra was a special one. I vividly remember stepping onto the stage for our first sound check surrounded by young, eager musicians with their instruments at the ready. And then they played. The sound they produced was magnificent, but it was more than that. You could hear their enthusiasm and excitement in the notes, but, more importantly, you could feel the heart and soul they had poured into the program. Being able to perform in Manila with these talented musicians was such a treat, and I'm grateful that my hometown audience got to experience their superb musicianship. I hope this won't be the last opportunity we'll have to perform together.""As you listen to this concert recording, which features songs handpicked by Lea as well as stories from her life, you will get to know this world-renowned singer and actress in an intimate and personal way.

But multiple identity was neither his problem nor his horizon. What he felt committed to was independent thinking and truth. This is obvious when one considers the literary and public activity he engaged in after having given up composition in 1967 - an activity that is reflected in the seven books he published between 1977 and 1983 by the London editor Oficyna Poetów i Malarzy. He wrote against censorship, against anti-Semitism, against political lies, against linguistic incompetence, and nobody could ever convince him that Chopin had broken the logic of harmonics by writing an accord of 6th instead of a 4th in measure 7 of the first Ballade in G minor, Op. 23 not the Institute Fryderyk Chopin, not Paderewski, not Bronarski, not Turczynski. In this case as in more important ones, his byword was "szargam swietosci" [I tarnish sanctity] - the title he gave to the book he published in 1980. As far as music is concerned, "sanctity" was in this period on the side of multi-faceted post-serialism and experimental music. He never believed that these trends had a future. He went on composing, during the years he composed, the music he believed in, which does not mean that he thought of it as having future either. But he did think that music should not be boring.

The cycle consists of seven meditations on the wounds of Christ which are brought into the context of the suffering and death of the Redeemer in a similar manner to meditations on the seven sorrows of Mary or the seven last words of Christ on the cross which were intended to enable believers to experience vicarious suffering in contemplation of the events of the passion.

The harmony and the instrumentation leave little doubt about its source of inspiration in Wagner. The suite from the incidental music to Strindberg's Dream Play is a series of short, atmospherically dense musical pictures, and in terms of its compositional history the Carnival Suite is a symphonic intermezzo dividing the opera Gondoliere des Dogen into two parts.

This Italian opera by Heinichen, one of the most valuable documents of its times in matters of compositional history, had been forgotten for some three hundred years until the ensemble premiered it in 2016. The historical circumstances behind this opera are very special: a quarrel involving the two world-famous castrati Senesino and Berselli caused a scandal that prevented the premiere of Heinichen's opera at the Dresden court. Some anecdotes relate that the singers accused the composer of imperfect knowledge of Italian and tore the score to shreds during the rehearsal process while he looked on. Others state that Handel had wooed away the Dresden singers during a journey from Italy to London. The score is a masterpiece. To be specific, Heinichen selects a highly exquisite instrumentation in order to depict the purity and fragility of the female character Elena: in the orchestral ritornellos three sorrowful oboe voices are heard without any sort of bass foundation - their song of lament itself is accompanied by the quiet pizzicato of the strings and in our interpretation of the basso continuo by harp arpeggios.

Giovanni Ristori was regarded as a talented composer, pianist, and organist, and obtained the post of »compositeur« with the Italian court acting company in 1717. He later received the posts of chamber organist in 1733, church composer in 1746, and the Dresden court's assistant chapel master under Johann Adolph Hasse in 1750. Unfortunately, more famous names, like Jan Dismas Zelenka and Johann Adolph Hasse, currently obscure Ristori's contributions in the public's perception of the Saxon court ensemble in the eighteenth century. The reason for this is simple: although the court acquired the composer's papers after his death, many manuscripts, including his complete church music, were removed from Dresden during World War II and never brought back there. Isolated new performances of extant compositions of high quality nonetheless have led to inquiries concerning the existence of other works by him. Therefore, the quest for Ristori manuscripts marked the beginning of the present recording project; and so it is that it is now our privilege to hear three top-quality sacred compositions by this talented composer.

One doesn't miss the violin." This is of course a controversial statement, especially since it refers to the embodiment of the sensuous romantic violin sonata. "The fact is that Franck almost always thinks starting from the organ," thus Korstick's argument continues, "and Cortot so genially distributed the voices of the octaves that the polyphonic structure becomes clearer."

Michael Korstick regards this work as Franck's "most important, central solo piece," and the Franck expert Jörg Demus views the Prélude, Aria et Final as one of the few "lucid" compositions of the late romantic period and pardons it for its difficulty in playing technique: "But what do difficulties mean when the emotional content compensates one for it in such a rich way!"",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=555242-2&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Piano,Germany,2018 cpo,2018 cpo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This month cpo is presenting three of his concertos on our fourth Graener album. Once again it is shown that this music more than deserves to be rediscovered. Hardly any other companion of Paul Graener's so intensely supported his oeuvre as did the cellist Paul Grümmer, the dedicatee of this composer's Cello Concerto and the soloist at its premiere in 1927. The critic Adolf Diesterweg wrote in a review: "Graener's new Cello Concerto contains naturally invented, succinctly formed music enabling the cellist, thanks to the transparent orchestral part, to sound his instrument effectively. In my view the most beautiful movement is the highly cantabile and atmospheric Adagio. The Violin Concerto has harmonically original, fascinating sound elements showing us Graener at an absolute creative summit. The time of composition of Graener's last finished composition, his Flute Concerto, coincides with the increasing bombardment and destruction of Berlin. Here it is above all the last movement that stands out and attracts our attention - and does so not so much because of its neoclassical guise, something already to be encountered in Graener's works of the 1930s, but rather on account of his choice of the life-affirming folk song, which displays a cheerful mood that can be harmonized neither with the difficult circumstances of Graener's life nor with the wartime events taking place at that time."",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=777965-2&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Germany,2018 cpo,2018 cpo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The illustrious organ builder Cavaillé-Coll promoted Widor's career while he was still a student and recommended him for the post of titular organist at St-Sulpice. Widor quickly gained renown as a composer, and his ten symphonies for organ solo are regarded even today as the non plus ultra of the virtuoso French school. Christian Schmitt's release of Widor's first four organ symphonies immediately demonstrated that this musician ranking as the most outstanding German organist of the younger generation was their congenial interpreter. Now Schmitt interprets the six other symphonies on the St-Ouen Abbey Church constructed by Cavaillé-Coll from 1888 to 1890. Widor is said to have described this instrument as "Une orgue à Michel-Ange" - a reference to the universal artist Michelangelo that may be interpreted to mean that for him this organ was just as multifaceted and perfect. The St-Ouen organ was one of the last instruments designed by Cavaillé-Coll. Since it has been preserved without changes, it is of great historical significance. And the opportunity to experience this music and the organ in spectacular SS makes for magnificent listening. In formal respects not so much changes in the fifth and sixth symphonies. Both continue to have five movements and adapt to the "classical" orchestral symphonic formats only in some passages. The rich sound palette of the organ, which leads to a majestic tutti, plays a more important role than in the orchestra. In his organ symphonies Widor seems to assign central importance to the presentation of the organ's infinitely combinable tones in the context of the most very different forms. Another Widor speaks to us in his late organ symphonies. Albert Schweitzer described them (1906) as "transitional works. They are designed for the organ and yet boldly orchestral in their conception. At the same time, however, the austere element increasingly comes into the foreground, the austere element that then led Widor back to sacred art in his last two symphonies [Nos. 9 and 10]." Here the Protestant Schweitzer meant the Catholic Widor's ultimate return to liturgical sources, in particular to Gregorian chant.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=777706-2&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Solo Instrumental,Germany,2018 cpo,2018 cpo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rather than following the order of the printed edition, La Venexiana has preferred here to arrange the sequence of pieces into three substantial liturgical settings, each one equipped with its own self-governing character.

Four of the works are recorded here for the first time. Inspired by the poetry of Jalaluddin Rumi, Liza Lim's violin concerto Speak, Be Silent, featuring American violinist Sarah Saviet as soloist, explores ideas of union and connection, as well as the ecstasy that comes at moments of change or transition. The atmospheric Ró - the Icelandic word for serenity - by Anna Thorvaldsdóttir is a piece of quiet but threatening moods that eventually comes to convey a fragile sense of identity and wholeness. In stark contrast, Mirela Ivicevic's Baby Magnify/Lilith's New Toy features the capricious demon and seductress Lilith experimenting her way through a series of alchemical transformations. Raw sonic materials come to the fore once more in Chaya Czernowin's Ayre... a study in forms of instrumental resistance, friction, and flow. Despite its title, it is not a song in any conventional sense but is instead a bare impression of musical line, extended, elongated, and unadorned. Finally, Rebecca Saunders' Stirrings Still II continues a longstanding fascination with the writings of Samuel Beckett, sharing its title with Beckett's final work of prose. Through its fragile and haunting soundworld, the piece's brittle textures and distant keening explore minute musical activities on the edge of extinction.

Because, in this point, a new mystery emerges: what happened to all those acquaintances that Scarlatti had the opportunity to find in Rome or Venice? Did he keep in contact with other European composers, such as Thomas Roseingrave, once at the service of the court in Madrid? What happened to the bridges built with London?

After studies in Japan with Auguri Suzuki and Yasuko Ohtani she made her concerto debut aged eight, and enrolled in Zakhar Bron's prestigious Academy in Interlaken, Switzerland. At age 10, Hattori became the youngest ever winner of the Karol Lipinski/Henryk Wieniawski Competition. Her debut recording featuring Franz Waxman's virtuoso showpiece Carmen-Fantasie is technically brilliant as well as being a rarity on record. The work is part of Waxman's score to the 1946 movie Humoresque which received an Academy Award. It was initially meant to be played by Jascha Heifetz but he was replaced by Isaac Stern for the film soundtrack. After seeing the film, Heifetz asked Waxman to expand the work and it was premiered on September 1946. Shostakovich's magnificent Violin Concerto No. 1 completes the album, with the Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester under conductor Alan Buribayev. The album was released in Japan earlier, and received enthusiastic reviews: "I was reminded of the debut of Hilary Hahn... her outstanding talent really comes across clearly... listening to her play Shostakovich's great cadenza, I'm sure I am not the only one who felt a shiver run down their spine."

The record bridges a number of disparate genres including experimental music, cowpunk, post-punk, Mexican folk music, mariachi music, and "spaghetti western" and giallo film scores. These Wicked Things began after Carpenter was commissioned by the Berkeley Repertory Theater in Berkeley, California to compose music and lyrics for Dominic Orlando's play The Barbary Coast in 2014. Based on the true crime book by Herbert Asbury, The Barbary Coast detailed the violent rise of San Francisco in the late 1800s. The play centers around Joaquin Murieta, a Mexican who went on a revenge spree after his wife was killed by miners. Two versions of "Rosita" and some incidental music from the play are included. After recording These Wicked Things with Beat Circus at the legendary Q Division Studios in Boston, Carpenter flew out to Tucson, Arizona to mix the record with esteemed producer Craig Schumacher. Carpenter worked with Schumacher previously on his singer/songwriter outing The Far End of the World.

The six "Haydn" Quartets were written between 1782 and 1785, while Mozart enjoyed great popularity in Vienna. Mozart had written a series of quartets in his youth, but it had been almost ten years since he wrote the last one. With the "Haydn" Quartets he makes quite different demands on himself, the musicians, and the audience. The structure is not so surprising- here we find fast first movements in what is today called sonata-allegro form, singable slow movements, minuets with trios, and often finale-rondos. But what he fills them with woke Haydn's admiration and now awakens ours. Haydn's admiration for his colleague 24 years his junior was expressed through the following words aimed at Mozart's father Leopold: "I tell you by God as an honest man, your son is the greatest composer I know in person or by name; he has taste and furthermore the greatest compositional knowledge." Haydn supposedly uttered this after having heard three of the quartets at a house concert at Mozart's residence, where both Wolfgang and Leopold most likely contributed.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=LWC1167&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,,2019 Lawo Classics,2019 Lawo Classics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The 20th anniversary of the composer's death was marked last year, while 2019 will be the year of the 100th anniversary of his birth. For many years the figure of Weinberg stayed in the powerful shadow of his senior friend and like-minded man Dmitri Shostakovich. Although Shostakovich himself thought extremely highly of Weinberg's composing talent, the latter was assigned a part of nearly an imitator. Only nowadays the wide audiences in Russia, the USA, Israel, Germany and other countries have a chance to comprehend the scale of this distinctive figure of 20th century music, a figure that stood on the border of three cultures - Jewish, Polish and Russian. Weinberg was a remarkable symphonist indeed leaving a large footprint in music theatre as well. But chamber music holds the key to discovering the genuine force of his creative gift and true understanding of his composing stylistics. His explicitly subjective and intimate message, the naked nerve of his emotional statement is what gives the impression of the music "written with blood of the heart," as Shostakovich said about one of Weinberg's compositions. "An artist's power and impotence are about his ability or inability to express the eternal, commonly known truth, casting new, his own light on it," Weinberg wrote. The set features Mieczyslaw Weinberg's ensemble and solo sonatas for violin, viola and cello, Quartet No. 7 and Concerto for trumpet and orchestra. The performers are the composer's contemporaries, prominent musicians of the 20th century - Alexander Brusilovsky, Fyodor Druzhinin, Alla Vasilieva, Timofei Dokschitzer, the Borodin Quartet, Rudolf Barshai and the author himself.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=MELCD1002519&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Russia,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Anton Batagov performs works written in different ages - Jean-Philippe Rameau's and John Bull's pieces, Bach's chorale preludes, Michael Nyman's soundtracks and Mozart's fantasias. "I'm not trying to find an answer to the question to which there's no answer - about the ratio of the so-called earthly and the so-called heavenly, serious and frivolous, true and contrived. The questions that sound in every note do not imply the "one and only right" answer. For example, one of Bach's preludes is named Herr Gott, nun schleuss den Himmel auf ("Lord God, now open the heavens"). Probably, the stereotypes of our consciousness immediately draw in mind some sort of a light and solemn image. But not so fast. What is in this music is an endless stairway, and every step on it is taken with incredible difficulty, because a person who asks to open wide heaven to him seems to be taking a new look at his life seeing it "from there". And Mozart knocks on this "heaven's door" without hiding his confusion and being afraid to seem sentimental, but occasionally, out of habit, wearing a theatre wig. As for Rameau and Nyman, they agreed they would wear wigs without taking them off, and let the distinguished audience decide what it's all about", Anton Batagov said about the album.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=MELCD1002572&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Russia,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ives has enjoyed far greater recognition in the vocal repertoire than Cowell, largely due to the latter's lack of published songs. The songs chosen for this collection offer a glimpse into one aspect of the remarkable output of both composers. Charles Ives (1874-1954) is rightfully called the father of contemporary American music. Fiercely individual as a composer, he was an innovator and a loner with a brilliant, creative mind. The songs chosen for this album range from the simplistic to the most complex, and represent the eclectic range of styles Ives used in his vocal compositions. His use of jazz idioms, pop songs, religious revival tunes and much more - often overlapping - created a unique style which has never been successfully matched. Henry Cowell (1897-1965) was deeply interested in spiritualism and mythology, served time in prison for child abuse (later pardoned and released) and wrote over 180 songs, most of which are unpublished and secreted away in libraries. Several manuscripts were obtained with the help of researchers to make this recording possible. Aylish Kerrigan is one of the foremost interpreters of contemporary Irish vocal music, and of Brecht, and her one-woman Broadway-style shows won acclaim when given in New York, Paris, Berlin and Dublin.

After all, much of the Croatian composer's style and techniques would be right at home in Rachmaninoff's concertos, Tchaikovsky's works, or Prokofiev's neoclassicism; and the name of the album's first work, Danube Rhapsody, naturally evokes associations with Smetana's similarly river-themed Vltava. Add to all of this that Mestrovic, like most of his great musical ancestors, is a talented virtuoso pianist, and it's easy to see why 3 Rhapsodies is bound to meet with enthusiasm. Of course, a skillful composer like Mestrovic doesn't confine himself to mere epigonism. And indeed, there is an original voice which constantly rises out from tradition. This is partially achieved through Mestrovic's clever instrumentation: the Danube Rhapsody's scoring includes, among others, a cimbalom and a tamburitza (the Croatian long-necked lute), which immediately tells the listener that he or she is hearing the Balkans, not Russia or Czechia. Similarly, the Chinese Rhapsody employs traditional Chinese instruments such as the pipa, erhu, and zheng, gorgeously contrasting them against the tremolo strings of the Zagreb Philharmonic Orchestra. American East Coast natives will find themselves swept back home in Mestrovic's New England Rhapsody, a composition initially as comforting and sentimentally heart-warming as the Transatlantic accent in a 1940's film. It's a deceptive respite, however: the final movement, interspersed with jazzy rhythmic elements and Mestrovic's resurfacing Croatian voice, takes the listener right back to the exalting ardor of the album's beginning. Instead of fizzling out like lesser compositions might, it finishes with a bang. There is no way around it: 3 Rhapsodies is a triumph. It is not at all unlikely that future generations, when asked to name the first famous Croatian composer that comes to mind, will exclaim with conviction: ""Mestrovic, of course!""",https://youtu.be/64NlWmz3l2o,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=NV6219&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Contemporary Era,,,2019 Navona Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

If Mahler and Prokofiev had collaborated on a composition, it would probably have sounded a lot like this: pensive, evocative, and nostalgic. Song of Eternity describes the eternal renewal of nature with cinematic impact. It is inspired by an ancient Chinese poem, as is the next piece, I Seek Rest for My Lonely Heart for A-Cappella Choir. This work continues the subject of nature, albeit in a more individualized fashion, capturing the sentiment of a distressed soul in search of peace in a pastoral setting. But it isn't just Far Eastern poetry which Dal Porto sets to music. Western verse receives due attention as well, and it's quite a trip through the ages: Spring, the Sweet Spring is an enthusiastic anticipation of the end of winter, based on a poem by Elizabethan poet Thomas Nashe. On the other hand, German Romantic poet Clemens Brentano laid the conceptual groundwork for Dal Porto's musical adaptation When Your Song Rang Out to Me, an unbridled, joyful choir supported by a lively piano accompaniment. Dal Porto strikes a more personal note with Romance for Oboe and Piano, dedicated to his beloved wife, oboist Tracy Carr. He also demonstrates considerable humor in his Exotic Animals Suite for Woodwind Quintet, depicting warbling birds, crawling reptiles, and growling big cats. The final piece, Mystic Mountain, evokes the sublime sensation of one overlooking a vast landscape after a breathtaking ascent to a mountaintop - with an intensity that is both uncanny and awesome. Caspar David Friedrich's ""Wanderer Above the Sea of Fog"" immediately springs to mind, and indeed, if one were to liken the Romantic painting to an album - The Music Of Mark Dal Porto would be it.",https://youtu.be/Os4W8kclAkg,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=NV6220&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Orchestral,,,2019 Navona Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2019,Navona,NV6215,896931005159,Mark John McEncroe ,McEncroe: Live in Ostrava,Janacek Philharmonic Orchestra,1,CD,11.69,17.99,"Mark John McEncroe, who started his musical training in his late 30's, had always exhibited a varied, profound interest in music - one that led him to work as a major music label manager over the course of two decades. No doubt that it was partially this section of his professional career which formed the basis of his personal compositional language. Unimpeded by the constrictions of a musical academic career, he developed a style which is unapologetically concrete and evocative. Live In Ostrava sets out with a work titled Symphonic Poem - The Passing, a piece which chronicles the renewal of attitudes and ideas; a process that may, at times, be painful, but remains an inevitable part of the human condition. There are wistful moments, too, but the outlook is quietly courageous: like someone who has made peace with his or her fate, The Passing concludes in a soft melancholia. While it draws on the same idea of the cyclicality of life, the initial mood in the following work, Symphonic Suite No. 1 - A Modern Medieval Tale, could not be more different. "Entrance of the King" is expectedly majestic and proud, at times even martial, as is "Strutting Peacocks - Hangers On at Court." Ever present is the truculent struggle against humanity's universal inner demons. "Rising Discontent" evokes the quiet before a storm, which gets unleashed in a fortissimo tutti in "Peasants Uprising" - the latter intriguingly interspersed by a lone violin as if to remind the listener of the individual being amid a common destiny. "An Uneasy Truce" and "A New Way Forward" both seem to evoke the inner turmoil of grappling with compromise and an uncertain future. The final movement, "The Quest - A Search for Truth," bears a transformative power reminiscent of that bestowed upon a soul which has found its true purpose. This finale in particular seems to ring true for the composer: while composing music may have been a late vocation for Mark John McEncroe, it is a vocation nonetheless.",https://youtu.be/Hm2mndvyr98,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=NV6215&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Orchestral,,,2019 Navona Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2019,Navona,NV6216,896931005166,Michael G. Cunningham; Ssu-Yu Huang; Beth Mehocic; Bruce Reiprich; Rain Worthington ,Croatian Chamber Orchestra: Beneath The Tide - A Collection of Concertos,Croatian Chamber Orchestra,1,CD,11.69,17.99,"PARMA Recordings, together with the esteemed Croatian Chamber Orchestra, is proud to release Beneath the Tide, a reflection on human emotion and experience through a collection of five concertos. As the title suggests, Beneath the Tide looks under the surface, examining underlying human realities that rise to the surface with the arrival of life's changes. Beneath the Tide starts off with Clarinet Concertos by Michael G. Cunningham. A weighty, dissonant performance, the solo clarinet is carried by the sometimes urgent, sometimes quietly brooding harmonies of the orchestra. Clarinet Concertos is followed by Rain Worthington's In Passages for string orchestra, where the solo violin and orchestra pass the lead voice back and forth. Ssu-Yu Huang's Guitar Concerto No. 1 is a reflection on nostalgia after moving to a foreign country. The guitar's voice, which sings a motif inspired by a Hengchun folksong "Nostalgia," is balanced by the accompanying orchestra, conveying the sudden outbursts of suppressed emotions that one in the midst of melancholy may experience. Bruce Reiprich's Lullaby, written upon the birth of a friend's child, is a harmonically lush composition for violin solo and orchestra. Tender and sentimental, the piece reflects on the wonder of new life and the love that comes as people gather to help a child grow. Beneath the Tide concludes with the triumphant Concerto for Piano and Orchestra by Beth Mehocic--triumphant not only in character, but also for the fact that the piece has finally been brought to life after its creation 40 years ago. The piece, which had been considered "too conventional" by Mehocic's instructors, is a grand, thematic performance with bright brass, lively percussion, and swooping piano gestures, and its entry into the listening sphere is not to be missed. Beneath the Tide provides a stunning look into the minds of five composers, as well as a reflection on the human experience itself. Demonstrating the multifacetedness of the recording orchestra, and the limitlessness of the denotation "concerto," Beneath the Tide is a first-rate classical experience.",https://youtu.be/ONh281MnnJs,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=NV6216&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Chamber Music,,,2019 Navona Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He became interested in composition whilst studying for his undergraduate degree at the Dublin College of Music, and in 1998 he moved to Glasgow to study for his Masters Degree at the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland with James MacMillan. He is now a composition lecturer there himself. He has been described as a 'composer of deep sensitivity, style and a knack for doing imaginative things with old samples' and this album displays a broad range of Fennessy's music, from purely acoustic chamber works to pieces for large ensembles involving electronics. The title track Panopticon is scored for cimbalon and string ensemble; the name refers to an 18th-century prison design in which cells were arranged around a circular central chamber from where a governor could keep an eye on prisoners at all times. Fennessy's Piano Trio features conversations from the late 1960s between John Cage and Morton Feldman, the music punctuating the extravagant gaps in the conversation. 13 Factories is performed here by Ensemble Modern under Johannes Kalitzke and includes electronics plus 4 hand-held speakers playing the sounds of old looms traditionally used in the Outer Hebrides to produce Harris Tweed.

His extraordinary achievements in the fields of Lieder and string quartet composition tend to overshadow his orchestral output, and his symphonic contributions have sometimes been viewed as marginal in comparison to Beethoven's, but judged on their own merits, these works display a high level of sophistication indeed. The repertoire featured on this release shows Schubert's symphonic development, from the Mozart- and Haydn-influenced first two symphonies to the masterful Third, in which his compositional voice is clearly perceivable. These three symphonies, all composed when Schubert was still a teenager, are complemented by works related to the stage. While the Overture in Italian Style in D major highlights Schubert's fascination for Rossini, the Incidental Music to Rosamunde contains some of the composer's most appealing melodies.

The 13 compositions of the Catalogue are very different from one other, in length, form and intent. L'alouette lulu is a kind of antiphonal poem. La chouette hulotte boldly maps out territory for experimentation. Le chocard des alpes and Le buse variable are mostly articulated by shouts, where we are close to noise. The material is often raw and dissonant, but Messiaen often uses what are traditionally blocks of dissonance to create consonance. There are pieces full of melody - Le loriot or La bouscarle - and songs rich in timbre but not saturated with color like La merle de roche. He liked to convey the impression that he composed music in isolation from the world around him, inspired first and foremost by God and by the birds whom he called God's musicians. The Italian pianist Ciro Longobardi has made a specialty of 20th and 21st-century music. He won a major piano prize at the crucible of European modernism in music, Darmstadt - only the second Italian pianist to do so - and he has given Italian premieres of significant works by the likes of Ives, Kurtág and Xenakis.

Is the motivation behind the works selected for this program entirely personal? Of course. This (always!) plays a role. It also plays a role that, since he began playing them, he has become attached to the pieces over the course of time. Despite all the personal interconnections, the works are very different. Three of them were practically written at the same time, but they represent three very different approaches to composing. And yet there is one thing in common in all the differences. All five composers do not aspire to a revolution; their pieces are rooted in the European tradition, ranging from Dittrich's "quasi-Sarabande," Flammer's extensive organ points or Huber's need for sections with a more personal character. On the other hand, none of the five pieces remain stagnant. Instead, the composers expand upon the possibilities made available to them. Herchet's piece is based on the traditional "beautiful" cello sound but is increasingly interrupted by deviations until this can be equated with the normal sound. Pagh-Paan combines Korean tradition with European avant-garde, and Flammer embeds a tour de force of cello performance in his clear structure.

Susanne Scholz and Michael Hell, both professors at Kunstuniversität Graz in Austria, share a common and fundamental interest in the strong statement of performance practice. It determines and reinforces their musical expressions and turns this recording into an experiment. The hypotheses that they establish here, which are based on different versions of Arcangelo Corelli's well-known op. 5 sonatas, focus on instrumental technique, the selection of instruments and the realization of the harpsichord part. The differences, which can be heard in each version through the appropriate choice of these historically informed methods, create a kaleidoscope of musical expressions and soundscapes. This release thereby has no intention of depicting a homogeneous representation of Susanne Scholz's violin sound and Michael Hell's continuo playing, but rather of showing how different stylistic differentiations can sound using the most popular violin sonatas of the 18th century as a starting point. The different handed down ornamented versions of the sonatas by Corelli himself, or by Geminiani, or by Roman or an anonymous master reflect the stylistic changes during the first half of the 18th century as well as the different characteristics specific to each country. In this recording, we take these differences into account by switching between three harpsichords and three kinds of violin bows.

He had already been carrying around his musings about arranging the Lutheran hymn "Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott" symphonically for some time. For this work, the composer created a symphonic model, which on the one hand emulated Beethoven, and on the other hand reached far into the future in terms of its conceptual disposition. The formal structure of the symphony stringently leads to the daring and monumental last movement - an extravagant choral arrangement of "A mighty fortress is our God." Before this powerful finale, the first three movements seem as if they were preludes. With the version on this release, arranged by Torsten Sterzik, the work had a musical and textual extension bestowed upon it, which proceeds very sensitively, and hardly influences the musical structure. Only in the third movement does Sterzik insert two arioso solo parts, which are based on the psalm text "Herr Gott, du bist unsere Zuflucht". Then he repeats the first part of the fourth movement - the theme of the hymn is first matched by the flute, and then taken up by the orchestra - and adds in the choir part Colla parte. Later in the fourth movement, the hymn is always heard, when the harmonic development of the original composition allows a connection with the melodic progression of the hymn "A mighty fortress is our God".

Two years later, the music-loving and cello-playing count of Schönborn, Rudolf Franz Erwein, had managed to secure him as a musician for his own household at his small residence in the county of Wiesentheid. Platti composed - in addition to his ordinary ouptut for worldly and spiritual occasions - for the cello, the Count's favourite instrument: a dozen sonatas, 28 concerti, 6 duets and over 21 trio sonatas in which the two melodic instruments are not playing at the same height. The music collection of the counts of Schönborn-Wiesentheid very probably consists of Erwein's personal music library and is today an important historical music archive.

That pioneering spirit has inspired this programme devised by InAlto. Among the manuscripts in the church's library is an anonymous source, probably dating from the very beginning of the 17th century, containing a complete cycle of settings of those seven psalms that ever since the time of Saint Augustine have been called the 'Penitenial Psalms'. This Roman score is absolutely unique of its kind, being monodic, and composed in the early operatic melodic narrative style of recitar cantando. InAlto presents here a completely original approach, one that puts this early 17th century repertoire in its context by recreating, in the tradition of the Oratorian spiritual exercises, an imaginary ritual that might unfold in the days preceding Holy Week, one in which each of the penitential psalms takes on its full meaning; while the extraordinary musical dissonances encoded in this manuscript are guaranteed to shock the listener.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=RIC399&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Netherlands,2018 Outhere,2018 Outhere,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One of the pinnacles of nineteenth-century pianism, Modest Mussorgsky's Pictures at an Exhibition broke new frontiers in its writing for the piano through its use of ringing bell-like sonorities, dramatic juxtaposition of registers and dynamics, its approach to resonance, percussive octaves and rapid hand-alternations, and sheer grandeur of sound. Introducing new ideas about virtuosity that owe much to orchestral thinking in the ways the full range of the piano's tone-colors are explored, this work requires immense stamina through combining great finger dexterity with unbridled power. Mussorgsky's masterpiece is coupled here with works by Ravel and Messiaen - composers who were indebted to the innovations of their Russian predecessor. Miroirs comprises a set of five pieces evoking contrasting moods and pianistic characters. Far from being Impressionist - a movement with which Ravel had little real affiliation -the 'Mirrors' of the title suggests more Symbolist associations in that the individual pieces explore ambiguities between supposed reality and 'reflected' simulation. Ravel was particularly fascinated by a line from Shakespeare's Julius Caesar: 'the eye sees not itself, but by reflection, by some other things.' An unusually non-descriptive work for Messiaen, without religious references or bird- song, Cantéyodjayâ is about musical process and is constructed as a mosaic-like collage in which a jaunty rhythmic refrain is contrasted with a multiplicity of contrasting ideas, many of which are re-workings from his gargantuan Turangalîla-Symphonie.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=SIGCD566&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Piano,Czech Republic,2019 Signum Records,2019 Signum Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This release contrasts Shostakovich's first two string quartets with the seventh - composed in memory of his late wife Nina. In composing his quartets prior to No. 7, Shostakovich had scrupulously followed a predetermined sequence of keys: according to this, the work should have been in E flat major. However Shostakovich, significantly, chose to break this pattern by writing his new quartet in F sharp minor, the key associated with such anguished music as Peter's remorse in Bach's St John Passion, and - particularly close to Shostakovich's heart - Mahler's unfinished Tenth Symphony.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=SIGCD559&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Chamber Music,Czech Republic,2019 Signum Records,2019 Signum Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Alwyn's position as a leading British composer was cemented by his prolific output (totaling more than 500 scores) while Carwithen abandoned composing altogether to act as Alwyn's amanuensis and secretary, eventually becoming his wife in 1975. Composed in 1948, Alwyn's atmospherically charged Three Winter Poems are charming works that benefit from the evocative, emotional immediacy that characterized his cinema scores. His last major work, 1984's String Quartet No.3, was a valedictory celebration of what the composer called "this most perfect of mediums". Unexpectedly animated (Alwyn was 79 at the time), it ends, says the William Alwyn Foundation's Andrew Knowles in his authoritative booklet notes, "in peaceful serenity, providing a moving and fitting swansong to Alwyn's composing career". While the prolific Alwyn composed 16 string quartets, Carwithen produced just two, both early in her career, both displaying, says Knowles, "a remarkably sound technique and a natural sense of warm emotion and drama", and both heard here in only their second recording. Composed in 1945 while she was still a student at the Royal Academy of Music, the String Quartet No.1 is a work of striking contrasts, the restless key signatures, variegated rhythms and stretched dynamics of the first movement complemented by its chiaroscuro-like companion conveying, by turns, moods of gentle tranquility, passion and austerity.

Joining the ensemble are soprano Elizabeth Cragg and composer-pianist Huw Watkins, whose Shakespeare setting The Phoenix and the Turtle (2014) moves puissantly from monotone chanting to solemn chorale for an allegorical poem mourning the passing of ideal love. Commissioned by Bath Camerata to mark its 30th anniversary in 2017, the disc's title track is a three-movement choral suite by Will Todd reflecting his interest in jazz music and featuring lyrics by the composer and former UK Poet Laureate Andrew Motion. The earliest work, Jonathan Dove's The Passing of the Year (2000), is a rich and varied tribute to the composer's late mother cast in seven sections and setting an eclectic array of texts by William Blake, Emily Dickinson, Thomas Nashe and others. To words by E.E. Cummings, Judith Weir's a blue true dream of a sky (2003) is, says English music specialist Jeremy Dibble in his booklet notes, "a revelation of the divine". Cecilia McDowall's Standing as I do before God is a moving centennial tribute to the British nurse Edith Cavell executed by the German army in 1915. Two pieces by long-time SOMM collaborator, composer-baritone Roderick Williams, complete the disc. The setting of George Herbert's Eucharistic poem Love bade me welcome (2007) is, in Jeremy Dibble's words, "an harmonically sumptuous, largely homophonic narrative" that speaks of atonement and redemption. Commissioned by Bath Camerata in 2018, Everyone Sang sets a familiar text by First World War poet Siegfried Sassoon in a poignant and powerful riposte to the futility of war that holds out the curative promise that "the singing will never be done".",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=SOMMCD%200195&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,EU,2019 SOMM Recordings,2019 SOMM Recordings,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

John Hosking accompanies on three rather striking instruments: an Italian replica harpsichord built by Goble, the Hill, Norman & Beard organ designed by George Guest and William Mathias at Bangor University, and a Steinway Model D concert grand. Olivia's naturally pure yet colourful tone shines throughout this recording, bringing a new lease of life to the later repertoire. Her effortless upper range and rich lower range make this essential listening. Olivia Hunt and John Hosking have worked together in various guises since 2013. They cofounded early music group Ensemble 1677 in 2016 with the objective of bringing early music to a wider audience. Since then they have performed numerous early music concerts as a duo or with the Ensemble, staged Purcell's opera Dido and Aeneas with professional soloists and a community chorus and undertook a successful tour of the South West of England.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=WHR055&medium=phy#,01 Classical,Classical,,United Kingdom,2018 Willowhayne Records Ltd,2018 Willowhayne Records Ltd,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is a journey of discovery through Jean Barraqué's piano works, deeper and deeper through quasi-archaeological layers that bring us closer to the arcana of creation. The Sonate pour piano (1950/1952), masterpiece and experiment at the same time, here recorded for the first time in the definitive recast version, demands of us that we break all boundaries, as far as our conception of tempo, dynamics or agogic is concerned, that we create and explore new imaginary spaces. The deeper we go back in time, the more mysterious and gloomy the early pieces (1947-1949). All of these works are premiere recordings. The prelude to the third act of Tristan [Richard Wagner] -- like a ghostly and fragile motto [of the young Barraqué] -- throws on the whole program its pale, nebulous light.

A Lebanese singer, a baroque musician and a jazz musician united in their love for beautiful songs that enable and inspire them to sing and play their best. Songs from the West and from the East, both old and new. Music by Dawud Hosni, Michel Lambert, Khaled Abou El-Nasr and Constantijn Huygens go side by side, with new lyrics in Arabic fitted to 17th Century Baroque songs and innovative arrangements for the classical Arabic ones. With this bold move these three musicians are setting the pace in crossing the borders between jazz, classical European and Arabic music.",https://youtu.be/rQTwRwIBSYs,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=ZEF9662&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical|Classical Crossover,Arabic,Netherlands,2019 Zefir Records,2019 Zefir Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
