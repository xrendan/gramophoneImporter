Introduced by an idyllic horn call motif, the Fourth Symphony - Bruckner's first in a major key - is characterized by a warm, natural, luminous underpinning. Both the slow movement, with its funeral march character, and the sometimes frighteningly dark and powerful final movement are in stark contrast to the symphony's initial warmth. As was often the case, Bruckner revised the symphony numerous times in the run-up to its premiere, which was given by the Vienna Philharmonic in 1881. Fabio Luisi recorded the 1878 version, with the finale from the 1880 version, with the Philharmonia Zürich. This version has long-since established itself as the official concert version of Bruckner's Fourth Symphony.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=PHR0110&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Orchestral,Switzerland,2018 Philharmonia Records,2019 Philharmonia Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It forms a part of the 'Cavalli tetralogy' of the past few years, conducted by the man who has become Cavalli's great ambassador: Leonardo Garcia Alarcón. Il Giasone, Dramma musicale, in a Prologue and Three Acts, first performed on 5 January 1649, alternates the tragic with the comic, with no concern for fidelity to the mythological legend of Jason and Medea. Francesco Cavalli's opera, composed for the carnival season in Venice, presents a mosaic of contrasted episodes, rich in musical emotions. His music here attains a remarkable degree of evocative power, with la musica having the upper hand over la dramma. Il Giasone represents the subtle equilibrium between lyricism and narrative. The comic, the tragic, and the supernatural all meet and mingle, and Cavalli's Lamenti - forming the climax of the work - are particularly unequalled,. Resolutely burlesque and zany, Serena Singaglia's production celebrates the opera's sensuality. Le Temps commented: 'In the pit, the Cappella Mediterranea with Garcia Alarcón pursue a sense of musical flux with delicacy, lightness and quick-footedness, ideally responding to the score's demands. With an instrumental sound that is both round and sprightly, they succeed in capturing the ludic dimension of the work, its melodic freshness, and its harmonic tensions.

All of the parts of the Requiem composed by Mozart himself exist in a complete four-part vocal score with organ bass - only the first movement is fully orchestrated - and contain virtually all of the key musical aspects: theme, harmony, melody, dynamics and modulation. According to Haas, "Mozart sketched out the main musical voices for the whole piece, producing almost a skeleton to the work" - in other words, fragments of sound. This was the approach used by Haas for his Klangräume (Sound Spaces): " In between these fragments of sound, I was able to add a different sound world - one in the style of the early 21st century." Haas responds powerfully to the nature of the fragments. Haas regarded the Requiem fragment as "sacrosanct". The only aspect that Haas adopted from Mozart was his orchestration: mixed choir, mostly with four voices, but also extended to include as many as 16 voices for the spoken passages, but no vocal soloists. Haas does not use any musical material written by Mozart. He only uses the key signature of D minor on which he builds a series of harmonics for his composition. However, Haas responds powerfully to the nature of the fragments. The choir does not sing any of the words from the Requiem. Haas used the letter from the City Council of Vienna answering Mozart's petition for the Position of assistant to the Kapellmeister at St. Stephen's Cathedral. "Although Mozart is offered the position, he is granted it with such administrative brutality, which shows a total lack of understanding of everything related to art." Haas uses the orchestral instruments to echo and foretell the moods in Mozart's fragments, adding intricate tonal contrasts to the polyphonic richness of Mozart's music. He adopts completely different compositional methods to establish connections to Mozart's composition.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=BVE08047&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Germany,,2018 Internationale Stiftung Mozarteum,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Beethoven's own instrument was the piano, and in his improvisations - which made him the darling of the Viennese salons - he merged virtuosity and unbridled expression. The piano concertos give a clear idea of these performances. At the same time, they are prime examples of Beethoven's ability to create large orchestral works with seemingly endless arcs of tension. The complete recording of all five works with Mitsuko Uchida and Sir Simon Rattle was one of the most spectacular projects of the Berliner Philharmoniker during the Rattle era - and at the same time the highlight of the collaboration between the orchestra and the pianist, which began in 1984. The performances were given a rapturous reception in the auditorium and in the press - as one critic wrote, the audience was overwhelmed by a "collective sense of happiness". With vibrant freshness, the performances brought the whole combative energy of these works to life. At the same time, they revealed Beethoven's incomparable spirituality, which - according to Mitsuko Uchida - "allows us to see to the end of the universe".",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=BPHR180241&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Germany,Berlin Phil Media GmbH,Berlin Phil Media GmbH,,,,,,,,,NR,NTSC,0,DVD-5,,,,Color,,1,2018,

Green opens the album with the title track, A Bissel Rhythm, a reworking of the George Gershwin standard, "I Got Rhythm." Already interpreted by such astounding jazz players as Charlie Parker and Sonny Rollins, Green turns the song into a Jewish expression by using traditional Hebrew scales, placing it in a minor Jewish-sounding key, and giving it a joyful, freilach (merry) fast tempo. That same joyful feeling is expressed in My Own Freilach, which should be familiar to anyone who has ever attended a Jewish wedding or bar mitzvah. Here, it is performed at near breakneck speed, leaving it to the players to see who can maintain the pace, whether they're playing the tune as written or improvising their own licks. With Doina and Ramble, the composer reimagines the funeral traditions of New Orleans, by placing the Doina, a klezmer form, in the context of an imagined New Orleans funeral. In this tradition, the slow funeral song would be followed by a joyful performance, which Green depicts in his piece Ramble. The Jewish March hearkens back to the time when Jewish musicians in Russia were often prohibited from playing loud instruments. When those musicians arrived in America, they let loose with drums, wind, and brass instruments. The Jewish March is a recreation of an early 20th century piece, complete with drum rolls - courtesy of Peter Sweeney - and plenty of loud, exuberant playing. This energy and spirit permeates the album as a whole, making for an experience that is as impressive as it is enjoyable to hear.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJ-8msL_EAQ&feature=youtu.be,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=BR8955&medium=phy,02 Jazz,Jazz,,,,2019 Big Round Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Completed in 1888 - one year before Richard Strauss's Death and Transfiguration - it echoed the composer's vision of seeing himself lying dead in a funeral bier surrounded by flowers. Deciding to use it as his opening movement, Mahler didn't finish the complete five-movement symphony until more than six years later, the longest time he spent on any work. The huge scale of the work apart, its weighty subject matter may well have contributed to the slow progress: Mahler himself outlined a scenario making references to the ultimate meaning of life and death (first movement), recollections of lost innocence and the desperation of unbelief (second and third movements), the return to naïve faith (fourth movement) and final redemption from the last judgement (finale). To convey this he took recourse to the human voice: incorporating a solo alto in the 4th movement Urlicht, he went on in the finale to risk comparison with Beethoven's Ninth Symphony by introducing a choir, as well as a soprano and alto soloist. Minnesota Orchestra and Osmo Vänskä have received praise for their previous Mahler recordings ('Vänskä and the orchestra are among the finest exponents of Mahler's music...', allmusic.com).

Both sets differ from the 'normal' configuration in that they allow a double bass to take part, albeit in different roles. Rossini, who composed his sonatas at the age of 12 (!), left out the viola and gave the double bass a more or less conventional bass role - apart from the occasional virtuosic outburst. The sonatas were first published in an arrangement for traditional string quartet and are often heard performed by string orchestras. In Vienna, where he was active as a composer and music publisher, Hoffmeister (1754-1812) chose a different solution than Rossini and gave his double bass player a leading role in the ensemble, letting it replace the first violin. It was no coincidence that this happened in Vienna - considering the amount of solo works for the double bass composed there, the standard of playing must have been exceptional. On the present recording, it is the Dutch player Niek de Groot who takes up Hoffmeister's challenge in the company of a Finnish trio consisting of Minna Pensola, Antti Tikkanen and Tuomas Lehto.

But the album - which includes some of the composer's earliest works - also features one of the very few, if not the only, compositions that Bach specifically dedicated to the harpsichord, namely the Sonata per il cembalo a 2 tastature. In it, Bach makes colorful use of the instrument by specifying various detailed and idiosyncratic harpsichord registrations. Spányi also performs two of the few fugues - in F and A major respectively - that Carl Philipp composed: besides the general shift in fashion away from intricate counterpoint to melodic simplicity, it is possible that he found father Johann Sebastian's achievements in that particular genre too hard an act to follow.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=BIS-2331&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Baroque Era,EU,"2018 BIS Records AB, Sweden","2018 BIS Records AB, Sweden",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the Finale of the sonata we hear a young man enjoying himself as he experiments with a Haydnesque idiom; a few years later there are traces of Mendelssohn and Schumann in 3 Romances, and of Chopin in Mazurke - also a world première recording. Especially when it comes to the choice of genre, Chopin is still an influence during the 1870s and Nocturne No. 1 and the Ballade, but both works testify to a composer finding his own voice. Fauré went on to compose another 12 nocturnes and two of these, No. 6 in D flat major from 1894 and the aforementioned Nocturne in B minor, serve as snapshots illustrating Fauré's later career and the composer's path towards increasing abstraction and a style characterised by timelessness and a detachment from fashionable trends.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=BIS-2389&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Piano,EU,"2018 BIS Records AB, Sweden","2018 BIS Records AB, Sweden",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both have strong roots in the traditional music of their native countries, and out of this meeting between traditions a fruitful collaboration has developed which also involves an investigation of the music that happens here and now. In Hemsing's words, the encounter 'opened up my musical horizons' and she has since performed a number of the composer's works involving the violin. Fire Ritual, the concerto that lends its name to the present album, was composed with Hemsing in mind. It exists in a version for violin and Chinese traditional orchestra, as well as the one recorded here, which Hemsing and the Oslo Philharmonic premièred in September 2018, conducted by the composer. For Eldbjørg Hemsing, Tan Dun has also created the concerto that opens the disc, Rhapsody and Fantasia, based on earlier works. Both works reflect the composer's memories of growing up barefoot in the countryside, and his later experiences of bringing together the shamanistic and spiritual world of his childhood with the discipline and philosophy of Peking Opera. Or in the composers own words: 'a reflection of those early memories of my youth, but through the lens of my current musical soundscape'.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=BIS-2406&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Orchestral,EU,"2019 BIS Records AB, Sweden","2019 BIS Records AB, Sweden",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There is no doubt that the mellow and warm resonance of the Bassoon, its technical elasticity, and its potential expressiveness come together harmoniously in these musical jewels. Was it due to the fashion of the time or the need to satisfy a patron that these were written and printed for the string instrument? It is difficult to say. However, we should never forget that authors such as Galliard, Boismortier, Corrette, etc. published their Sonatas with the captions: "for cello and bassoon," "for bassoon and cello," and "for cello, viola, and bassoon." They would not limit their execution to one single instrument: the composition itself would leave the option open. The compositions of Geminani, Boccherini, Breval, and others would not allow this possibility: the constant use of chords and the range would impose the string instrument. In these six Sonatas by Vivaldi too, we find the use of some chords and bichords, but these seem to be added to justify the caption "Sonatas for Cello" rather than for a real musical necessity.

An increasing number of music lovers have found in the tango an art that cuts across barriers of language and culture and the genre has made its mark forcefully in the media and mass communication. The prime mover in this was Astor Piazzolla who broadened the horizons of the tango by taking it out of Argentinian folklore and into concert halls throughout the world. And audiences everywhere have been won over by the richly passionate character which has ensured the tango's universal appeal. "Not Just a Tango" is a crossover project for concert performance encompassing tango, classical music and jazz. The historical, stylistic and musical foundation is, of course, the tango of Argentina. A masculine element (the piano) and a feminine element (the violin) have been added to mirror this harmoniously sensual dance in sound. What makes "Not Just A Tango" special is that arrangements assimilated the tango of folk music and popular song and expanded it with variations that take in jazz and hints of musical forms which might at first seem unusual, such as the waltz or rumba. Yet the spirit of the tango always comes through in the ever-growing excitement of these brilliantly intense virtuoso musical dialogues between soloists who are fully each other's equal in timbre and line.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=GB5201-2&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Italy,Bongiovanni 2018,Areasonica Records 2018,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mascagni might well have taken for his own Puccini's famous quip, "Against everything and everyone, make a work from melody". And in Iris it is melodic invention which shows the composer's genius at its greatest. A melody by Mascagni is usually long, smooth and Italian-sounding; and Iris is full-on melody all the way, particularly in such crowd-pleasers as Jor's Serenade, the "Hymn of the Sun" or the duet in Act II "Oh come al tuo sottile corpo s'aggira", which includes the famous "Piovra". Furtheremore, with a little effort listeners can identify what would be the various musical "numbers".

He who wants to go beyond it must pass away. [...] Those who have written a Ninth stood too close to the hereafter."" Arnold Schoenberg wrote those words in reference to Gustav Mahler, who had just died without ever having heard his own Ninth Symphony performed. Bruckner was apparently afraid of the fatal number as well: ""I don't want to start on my Ninth at all, I don't dare". However, very soon after the completion of his Eighth Symphony in September 1887, Bruckner started on his first drafts. Overall, work on the Ninth then dragged on over the long period from 1887 to 1896, having to be constantly interrupted because of the composer's deteriorating health. Bruckner finally died while working on the fourth movement - and his masterpiece dedicated to ""the beloved God" remained unfinished. Even without a finale, the three-movement torso that survives is, of course, extremely impressive. The completed movements were first performed in Vienna on February 11, 1903, in an unusual personal version by the conductor Ferdinand Löwe. The actual first performance of the original score with its three movements only took place on April 2, 1932 in Munich. Ever since, Bruckner's Ninth has been an essential part of the Late Romantic symphonic repertoire - above all in its original version. In January 2014, Mariss Jansons and the Symphonieorchester des Bayerischen Rundfunks presented the original version of the three completed movements to the public in Munich at the Philharmonie in Gasteig.

He was also an accomplished performer on both violin and viola, and his own compositional output reflects his instrumental mastery, filtered through his experience of leading the Italian premieres of quartets and symphonies by Beethoven as well as operas by Mozart: he was a complete musician of his time. The F major Viola Concerto opening this attractive new album belongs to Rolla's apprentice years in service to the ducal court at Parma. With its uncompromising technical demands and unwavering focus on the solo instrument, the concerto represents a missing link between the idioms of Tartini and Paganini. The dawn of bel canto may be discerned in the slow movement of the album's concluding D minor Viola Concerto, which concludes with a charmingly bucolic Rondo. Dating from Rolla's Milanese years, the 1805 Tantum ergo also features a concertante role for the viola, in sinuous accompaniment to the vocal bass soloist: a highly original device perhaps prompted by Mozart's famous Sinfonia Concertante. As a performer, Rolla reserved the most haunting melodies and moments for himself: After a vocal cadenza on the closing Amen it is the viola that sets the seal on the work with an intensely lyrical phrase and a brilliantly virtuosic stretta. The D major Sinfonia likewise belongs to the first decade of the 1800s - infused with Rossinian verve and bubbling with operatic drama in the quick outer movements. The Milanese violist Simonide Braconi plays Rolla's music to the manner born, being the long-standing principal violist at La Scala. He is accompanied here by a chamber orchestra based in nearby Pavia and specialising in Classical-era works by neglected composers.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=BRI95504&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Germany,2018 Brilliant Classics,2018 Brilliant Classics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Some impression of his appearance may be inferred from the nickname widely bestowed upon him as 'Il gobbo della regina' ('the queen's hunchback') during his period of service in the city to the expatriate Queen Christina of Sweden. Working in Rome and Genoa in close partnership with his fellow composer Alessandro Stradella, Lonati left Genoa in a hurry after the unexplained fatal stabbing of his friend in February 1682. Titled as sinfonias on the manuscript, this collection of 10 trio sonatas probably dates from Lonati's Roman period, which means they were written before 1677, when he left the city. By no means generic in character, each of them searches for a new and personal stylistic identity within the conventions of the form. The first movements vary considerably in form and duration, often highlighting one or other of the instruments in concertante prominence. Lonati's flair as a performer transfers readily to his writing: this is music of sparkling temperament, highly polished expression and often formidably challenging technique. In his treatise Il trionfo della pratica musicale, Francesco Maria Veracini, one of the great Italian violinists of the 18th century, described Lonati as the 'foremost light among violinists'. This recording puts the most eloquent case for his claim. Founded in 2014 by the violinist Ewa Anna Augustynowicz, Ensemble Giardino di Delizie is a quartet of early-music experts based in Rome but working internationally, not only with each other but also within groups led by Christophe Coin, Amandine Beyer and other luminaries of modern Baroque performance.

The comparatively early Op.18 No.2 shares the modest dimensions of Haydn's early keyboard sonatas, though by then Dussek was 32 years old and Haydn had already paid fulsome tribute to the younger man's 'remarkable talents'. Upon his marriage to Sophia he ran a moderately successful music publishing firm with his new father-in-law, Domenico Corri, but when the firm went bust late in 1799 Dussek abandoned Sophia and their daughter and fled to Hamburg; during the following year he wrote a trio of sonatas published in 1802 as Op.45. These are all more ambitious in scale and expressive reach. The slow movement of Op.45 No.1 bears the significant marking of Adagio patetico, and it explores reaches of grave feeling through harmonies in advance of their time. The two-movement Op.45 No.2 opens with a Larghetto sostenuto of grave concentration, though the mood is lifted by a gently circular, almost Schubertian Andantino. A lighter, more cheerful character pervades the D major Sonata Op.45 No.3, which concludes with one of the effervescent Rondos for which Dussek was celebrated in his own lifetime. On this recording Wolfgang Brunner plays a pair of instruments from Dussek's time: an 1804 Broadwood, and a modern copy of a Viennese fortepiano originally made around 1810 by Michael Rosenberger. Once complete, the cycle will form the first-ever recording of Dussek's sonatas on historically appropriate instruments.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=BRI95605&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Germany,2018 Brilliant Classics,2018 Brilliant Classics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He wrote more than two hundred pieces for the instrument, both liturgical and secular, and explored most of the genres that existed at the time. He is considered to be the apex of the 17th century's south German organ school and generally one of the most important composers of the middle Baroque. His sphere of activity included central and southern Germany (modern Bavaria, Thuringia and Stuttgart), as well as important formative years in Vienna in his early 20s, during which he absorbed the Habsburg Empire's dominant Italian and south German influences. The southern organ-builders' emphasis on manual divisions is also apparent in much of Pachelbel's liturgical organ music, which is relatively simple and written for manuals only.

She studied piano, composition, counterpoint, harmony, conducting and voice at the Conservatorio San Pietro in Naples. While in Egypt on a concert tour, she met and soon married a Swiss man of means living in Cairo, Paolo Feninger. Settling there in the 1920s, Rogatis helped to found the National Conservatory of Egypt, where she also taught piano and guitar for over 40 years. Her husband's death prompted her retirement in 1963 back to Naples, where she lived quietly until her death in 1979. Her career as a teacher allowed little time for composition, but de Rogatis took a selfless attitude to her own work. 'If teaching hundreds of young people about the poetry and beauty of music, instead of composing works and symphonies, means giving one's life up, then that's what I've done. But if some of these young people, who are now adults, can understand a Beethoven symphony or sonata and find in it solace and a guide for their own lives, then I will live in their memories just as I would have done in my works, and my life will have been equally useful.' Her relatively slender output - 60 acknowledged works - is dominated by piano music, but de Rogatis also wrote instrumental songs and dances for the guitar, and a four-movement Sonatina of no less ready melodic appeal, all presented here by her modern-day counterpart, the Italian guitarist Cinzia Milani. In a personal introduction to the scholarly booklet note, Milani observes how de Rogatis 'reconciled brilliant virtuoso flair with an elegantly feminine touch, even when the overall tone is jocular or ironic.' Milani's decision to record this music on a distinctly modern instrument is part of 'an imaginary dialogue between different periods and the changes they heralded: like glancing backwards while walking towards the future.'",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=BRI95627&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Germany,2018 Brilliant Classics,2018 Brilliant Classics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The group also illustrates the variety of interpretative practices of the period. The concluding O quam suavis est Domine is sung by a single soprano while the vihuela accompaniment supplies the remaining five parts. Church choirs sang this music in the liturgy, but minstrels also played it during processions, and there was free traffic between sacred and secular contexts. Coro Victoria was founded by its director, Ana Fernández-Vega, to recover and preserve a native, historically informed tradition of singing Spanish polyphony from its Renaissance-era high noon, exemplified not only by Victoria himself but also his contemporaries such as the Seville-born and bred Alonso Lobo (indeed, Victoria considered Lobo his equal). He is now best known for a haunting, six-voice setting of the Requiem, and his magnificent motet for the obsequies of King Philip II, Versa est in luctum shares the Requiem's tone of mourning and remembrance, established by a dense mesh of overlapping counterpoint. Coro Victoria also presents other sides to a composer whose style is far more various than is commonly assumed. As well as the beautifully handled techniques of canon and counterpoint in Marian motets such as Ave Maria and Ave Regina coelorum, distinguishing features of Lobo's style are his jagged melodic lines, a far cry from Palestrina's smooth curves, and his more animated conclusions, both vividly demonstrated by Vivo ego, dicit Dominus. There is also a complete, portmanteau setting of the Mass, drawn from his Missa O Rex gloriae, Missa Petre ego pro te rogavi and Missa Simile est regnum caelorum, with the Credo filled in by the separate Credo Romano, which is underpinned by a figured bass and continued to be popular long after his death.

Ceìsar Franck (1822-1890), although considered one of the foremost 19th-century French composers, was not in fact French by birth, but Belgian. He only became a full French citizen in 1873 after he had been appointed organ professor at the Paris Conservatoire. His career can be divided into three distinct periods, each characterised by the production of very different types of music. From 1834 to 1846, under pressure from his father, he concertised as a piano virtuoso, and most of the works of this period were written with that purpose in mind. In the decade following his marriage in 1848 he composed virtually nothing but became celebrated as an organist, and he would bring the spacious dimensions of that instrument to his sound world in the years to come. His 'middle period' - from about 1858 to 1879 - was devoted to the production of works for organ, church music and a series of monumental choral pieces on religious or biblical subjects. In these three decades he wrote virtually nothing for the piano. From 1879 begins the decade of his late flowering in the great chamber and orchestral works, ushered in by his well-loved Piano Quintet and containing the pieces for which Franck is widely known.

Concerto, duos, songs and arrangements of Rossini, Cimarosa and others demonstrate Giuliani's verve and versatility in marrying Spanish guitar traditions to the emerging Italian bel canto style. Giuliani always had an ear for a memorable tune, whether his or someone else's. There are two versions here of The Last Rose of Summer, and one of The Blue Bells of Scotland, though the Puglian composer never travelled beyond the shores of mainland Europe. The fashionable genre of variations on an operatic theme - of which Giuliani produced some 60 examples - is represented here by a set on 'Io ti vidi e t'adorai', from the opera Amazilia by Giovanni Pacini, who enjoyed a vastly more celebrated reputation than he does today. Stefano Cardi has also made selections from longer collections such as the Divertimenti notturni, the Choix de mes fleurs cheries and Zwölf neue Wald-Ländler: all brief, simple and yet colorful melodies. He plays them here on an original 1821 guitar made by Gennaro Fabricatore. Though it now resides in the possession of a Genovese museum, the instrument was originally owned by the writer and political activist Giuseppe Mazzini, who spearheaded the republican movement towards a unified Italy.

Operas such as I quattro rusteghi and I gioielli della Madonna occupy a place on the fringes of the repertoire, and Brilliant Classics have made a persuasive case for him as a composer of chamber music in a post-Brahmsian mould with the release of his piano trios. This album was recommended by Classics Today for the 'eloquently sustained' performance of Trio Archè, displaying 'a whimsical discursiveness... that might be described as the lovechild of Schubert and Fauré.' Much the same might be said of Wolf-Ferrari's piano music on the evidence of this new recording by the Italian pianist Costantino Catena, who has made many well-received albums with the Camerata Tokyo. To open the album, Catena has made his own completion of an early, substantial (19-minute) Bagatelle that Wolf-Ferrari left unfinished. Theatricality and high contrast mark the Bagatelle throughout, as one would expect from an experienced composer for the stage, and they lend beguiling variety to the other first recordings here, of Variations on the minuet from Verdi's Falstaff, a Chopin-Phantasie in B minor and a Scherzino, all dating from Wolf-Ferrari's prodigious twenties when he was the toast of new Italian music. Wolf-Ferrari turned to the Romantic genre of character-piece in three Impromptus Op.13 (1904) and three Klavierstücke Op.14 (1905), but he addressed the form in a personal and authentic manner.

In fact the mandora has a far more mellifluous timbre than its instrumental cousin, and its subtle palette of tone-colors is heard to best advantage in solo repertoire, such as the pair of anonymous Suites and the G minor Sonata by Giuseppe Antonio Brescianello (1690-1757) played on this new recording by Gábor Tokodi. A closer comparison to the mandora would be with the lute. They share a transparent, silvery sound that is often lost in ensemble; the biggest difference is their outward appearance. An 8-course Renaissance lute usually has 15 strings, and a 13-course Baroque lute has 24, whereas the anonymous Budapest manuscript from which Tokodi has drawn this Suite in C major requires an instrument with only six. In fact, the mandora evolved during the 18th century into an instrument tuned to the same strings as the classical guitar. The mandora and its music were cultivated primarily in South Germany and in the neighbouring Danube region of the Habsburg Empire. One particular aristocrat of the region cultivated her playing of the mandora and accordingly accumulated a substantial library of music for the instrument, among which may be found 16 sonatas by Brescianello, which make demands far beyond the capabilities of a dilettante. Further library sources in Bratislava and Budapest supply the material for the other two composite works to be enjoyed here. A cellist by early training, Tokodi began to play the guitar at the age of 15, and it was with this instrument that he graduated as a performer, and has since toured Europe and further afield with distinguished early-music ensembles such as the Savaria Baroque Orchestra and the Baroque Ensemble of the Budapest Festival Orchestra.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=BRI95869&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Germany,2018 Brilliant Classics,2018 Brilliant Classics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

'Normally if you listen to a recording you would like to redo it immediately, because you discover so many mistakes or things you would have done better. But this one, it's OK. Recordings will not always make money or sell a lot of discs, but for an artist, they can be a wonderful memory of a certain period in your life.' For Klassik.com, these recordings were deemed a 'beautiful achievement': especially in 'Es träumte mir' and 'Unbewegte laue Luft' Op.57 Nos. 3 and 8: as exciting as it is atmospheric, reaching a climax of subtly varied timbre in the Vier ernste Gesänge. Volle also scores highly in Die schöne Magelone.' Volle is joined here by his brother Hartmut for the recitation of Tieck's complementary prose text, which many recordings omit. Klassik.com also drew particular attention to the sympathetic partnership of Volle with the mezzo-soprano Stephanie Irányi and Volle, 'perfectly coordinated' in the Four Duets Op.28 and a selection from the Deutsche Volkslieder WoO33, from which Brahms took particular pleasure late in life. Volle's 'warm, sympathetic baritone' (Gramophone) and personal conviction illuminate all the repertoire here, which is drawn from throughout the composer's song-writing career. 'When I sing Brahms,' reflects Volle, 'I feel the deep musicality and also humanity and maybe also unfulfilled love he was looking for. Like Schubert he puts his feelings in the music and it takes everything from me when I do it. For me he's a really great Lieder composer.'",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=BRI95916&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Germany,2018 Brilliant Classics,2018 Brilliant Classics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The trio's second release on Cantaloupe Music, American Dream, focuses on the work of composer Scott Wollschleger, and includes three new pieces: the epic title work, as well as Gas Station Canon Song and We See Things That Are Not There. Larson describes American Dream as "a reflection of the contemporary American state of mind." Rather than making a direct political statement, the album reflects the contradictory nature of the "American Dream" in our current socio-economic climate. "This music expresses the strongest sense of urgency I've experienced in my entire life," Wollschleger explains, "channeling feelings of doom, optimism, hopelessness, and the sublime. Much like a dream, these pieces weave an interconnected musical fabric of contradictory worlds." In essence, it's a direct reference to a modern American paradox: how the majestic and the repellent always seem to coexist in a state of flux, no matter the medium. American Dream is laden with rich melodies and jarring dissonances that interconnect throughout, creating a sonic experience that's by turns cinematic, surreal, contemplative, provocative -- and ultimately, empowering.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiBnXDuemFw,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=CA21145&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Modern Era,United States,2019 Cantaloupe Music,2019 Cantaloupe Music,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although he was not a revolutionist in terms of notation or performance forces, he was able to creatively subordinate all the achievements of modern musical language to innovative formal approaches. Hartmann wrote with extraordinary verve, creating artistic phrases with a broad ambitus, at the same time he could masterfully juggle short motifs, subjecting them to elaborate variational and contrapuntal transformations. In terms of harmonics, Hartmann's music is tonal, though strongly chromatic, which deprives the listener of a secure sense of anchoring in a specific key. The composer did not shy away from strongly dissonant sounds, sometimes close to clusters. Sound beauty in purely aesthetic terms was not his priority. He created music in the service of truth, uncompromising and authentic. String Quartet No. 1 'Carillon', dedicated to Hermann Scherchen, was awarded the first prize in the composition competition in Geneva in 1935. The first movement of String Quartet No. 1 opens with the famous Jewish melody Eliyahu Hanavi. The quartet contains numerous elements inspired by folk music. The contrasting second movement has a quasi religioso character. The third movement is very lively and energetic, and the glissando dialogue between the viola and cello against the background of semiquaver tremolo in the violin brings to mind the sounds of sirens alarming about the upcoming bombardment. String Quartet No. 2 was dedicated to Hartmann's wife Elisabeth. The work written just after the end of the war is full of images and memories from the time of terror. In terms of technique and expression, it is definitely a more mature composition. Alongside from Karl Amadeus Hartmann's string quartets, the album features a small piece Langsamer Satz by Anton Webern. This unusually beautiful work full of sophisticated sounds comes from the period when Webern still wrote tonal music, before becoming one of the fathers of dodecaphony. It reflects the soul of a 21-year-old man in love, his gusts of heart, euphoria and melancholy.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=ACD245&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Poland,2018 CD Accord,2018 Airis String Quartet,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recipient of a 2015 Avery Fisher Career Grant, Lipman has created an album of uplifting and spiritually transcendent works for viola and piano, dedicated to his late mother. Hailed by The New York Times for his "rich tone and elegant phrasing," Lipman is heard in the world-premiere recording of Clarice Assad's fantasy piece, Metamorfose, which the violist commissioned. It's a poignant commentary on grief and acceptance. Robert Schumann's Fairy Tale Pictures is dreamlike and fanciful. York Bowen's richly expressive Phantasy draws on the Russian Romantic tradition. Garth Knox's free-flying Fuga libre transfigures Bach-like fugal fragments through modern, coloristic performance techniques. The album's finale is the first-ever recording on viola of Hollywood composer Franz Waxman's popular violin showpiece, Carmen Fantasie. England's The Telegraph praised Lipman as "gifted with poise and a warmth of timbre" for his recording of Mozart's Sinfonia Concertante with violinist Rachel Barton Pine, the Academy of St. Martin in the Fields, and Sir Neville Marriner (Avie), which topped the Billboard classical chart.

When Arriaga moved to Paris to study under Fétis, Guérin and Baillot in 1821, he revised the overture, making changes to the instrumentation and removing a third theme group. It is the revised version heard on this recording. Air from Médée and Herminie form parts of the autograph volume 'Ensayos lírico-dramáticos' (Lyric-dramatic essays) that completes this release, here sung by one of Scandinavia's most sought after concert singers, Berit Norbakken Solset. Tonally ambiguous Symphony in D minor (which begins and ends in D major) alongside the Overture in D major, which was written 'without having learnt the principles of harmony' are proof that Arriaga's premature death aged 19 was a 'sad loss to Basque music'.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=CHAN%2020077&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,United Kingdom,2019 Chandos Records Ltd,2019 Chandos Records Ltd,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The programme is built around the Grand Sonata (no.3). This impressive, large-scale work was originally composed in 1834, later revised in 1853 and eventually premiered (6 years after the composer's death) by Schumann's young protégé Johannes Brahms. Jean-Efflam first discovered the work though a recording by Vladimir Horovitz in the 1980s, and got to play it to and discuss the work with Horowitz in Paris in 1985. Like Horovitz before him, Jean-Efflam combines elements from both the original and revised versions of the work on this recording. Bavouzet has chosen to couple this with another early work - the "Faschinsschwank aus Wein" - and then the much later work the "Drei Fantasiestücke". He closes with the "Gesange der Frühe" which were among the last compositions that Schumann wrote before his attempted suicide and incarceration in February 1854.

In the comment contained in the accompanying booklet, the Paduan pianist writes: "There isn't a red line linking the programme, I simply chose pieces that were important to me. The pivotal part is the Études Op. 25, a colossal challenge for me. I have played Chopin's Études since I was young, but they always lacked something, I was never convinced. Then finally I found the courage to really work intensely on Op. 25, I played it several times in concert and I felt the need to focus on them somehow. This was the right moment. The programme follows with Bach/Busoni's Chromatic Fantasia and Fugue, and Après une Lecture de Dante, la Fantasia quasi Sonata by Liszt. I am very attached to the Chromatic Fantasia and Fugue, it was one of the pieces I played for my graduation, the only suggestion from Palmieri. It was a truly important work for her. Then I discovered Busoni's version and I said to myself Why not? I included the Dante myself, well, basically because I like it! It hasn't been a walk in the park, actually, because of this reason, when I arrived at the point I was satisfied with my playing I decided I wanted to record it. To do this I chose to make this [video], also because I find it really beautiful to see the face of a musician whilst they are playing.

At the same time, the recording, which went on to win several awards, also marked the beginning of the career of the Sonatori around Andrea Marcon, now long famous.

Well, if that's the case, jazz is certainly my favorite dialect. The spontaneity and collaborative nature of jazz makes it ideal for swiftly building bridges between groups of musicians and audiences alike. Nothing is as musically exciting and refreshing as a newly forged relationship of outstanding jazz performers and composers, especially when brought together in the close comfort and proximity of one's living room. This was to be the beginning of what has now developed into a well-brewed and mature unity of musicians that have since then performed at jazz festivals in both Luxembourg and Reykjavik and have now recently recorded this outstanding album, featuring compositions from all four members." The compositions on this album provide a good framework for the musical dialogue. Ranging from melodic ballads such as Flosason's 'Father of Light' and Reis' 'Thank you letter,' the folkish melody and melancholy of Demuth's 'Dante' and Reis' 'Tundra,' to Flosason's more calculated and intellectually infused 'Counting sheep' and 'Forty-nine,' over to Herr's mystic and haunting 'Moonglow.'",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=DMCHR71360&medium=phy,02 Jazz,Jazz,,Austria,2018 Challenge Records,2018 Challenge Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the early 1970s, for example, he found an unpublished and thus unknown Double Concerto for two flutes by Franz Doppler, and recently - among several other works that were thought to be lost - a Sonata by the same composer. As if the Double Concerto had been just the composition the flute world was waiting for, it immediately became a standard work in the repertoire. It has been very frequently performed since then and was already recorded in 1976 by András Adorján together with the doyen of flautists, Jean-Pierre Rampal (ERATO). Now, these new Doppler ""Discoveries"" are also so attractive that the most eminent representative of the current flute scene, Emmanuel Pahud, enthusiastically agreed to help record them.

Bach's Partita in B flat major. When I first heard it in concert I knew immediately that this composition would work wonderfully for the harp. With the Gigue as my starting point, I began to arrange the Partita for harp. Of course, the instrument does have other tonal qualities than the piano - and, like any instrument, it has its technical limits when it comes to performance practice. When it comes to chromaticism, the mechanics of the harp are more limited than those of the piano, and one only has eight rather than ten fingers to play with. But it was precisely that challenge that fascinated me in the process of arranging the works: you first need to have a clear idea of the work's intention and to have formed your own view of its interpretation. The task then is to find ways and means to develop one's ideas and perhaps to achieve an even clearer interpretation than would have been possible on the original instrument. In this way, arranging the work for another instrument intensifies the performance, because the use of a new instrument allows other, new facets in the compositions to be illustrated and new tonal nuances achieved..."",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=HC19008&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Solo Instrumental,Germany,2018 Profil Medien,2018 Profil Medien,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I wanted to link my music with my painting, to connect the drummer's gesture to the painter's. I make no distinction between the two disciplines, I have always had a very close relationship with them and I've always felt an almost simultaneous desire to play/compose and to paint, to externalize a vision and an inner song.

S. Bach after candidates Telemann, Graupner and Fasch all declined for different reasons. The ensemble serves up Advent and Christmas cantatas by Graupner, Fasch and the great Bach himself, as well as a splendid Telemann concerto led by father and daughter Bernadini. Also contributing to the album are soprano Berit Norbakken Solset, mezzo-soprano Marianne Beate Kielland, tenor Anders J. Dahlin and baritone Halvor F. Melien- all with careers spanning the globe. Barokkanerne are an Oslo-based Early Music ensemble and one of the very finest independent professional baroque orchestras on period instruments in Scandinavia. The orchestra is Norway's most active baroque ensemble with concert series in Oslo, concert tours in Norway and abroad, countless festival performances, and continual efforts to improve competence within Early Music among youth, students, amateurs and professionals. Since 2009 Alfredo Bernardini has been a much-beloved guest leader for Barokkanerne, and he can also be heard on two of the ensemble's earlier releases. Cecilia Bernardini is widely considered to be one of the most versatile violinists of her generation and has won prizes on both the modern and baroque violin.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=LWC1169&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,,2018 Lawo Classics,2018 Lawo Classics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Wilsonw as an important figure in Scotland's musical renaissance, whose exceptional output established him as a composer of particular significance. Wilson completed five symphonies of which two are recorded here: Symphony No. 3 and Symphony No. 4 'Passeleth Tapestry,' both of which were premiered by the RSNO. The Third Symphony, a RSNO commission, was described in The Guardian as "one of the most impressive works written by a Scottish composer in recent years." The Fourth Symphony, written to mark Paisley's 500th anniversary, features masterly orchestration throughout and Wilson's treatment of the strings is especially fresh and inventive. Carillon was commissioned by Glasgow city council in 1990 as part of its European City of Culture celebrations, as the inaugural work to celebrate the opening of the city's new Royal Concert Hall, where the RSNO is now based.

The Suite presumably dates from 1901 or early 1902, shortly before its first known performance, which was given by the composer and Bertrand Roth on 20 April 1902 as part of Roth's regular series of salon concerts at his home in Dresden. An inscription on the surviving manuscript names two dedicatees: Lucy Bambring and Edith Hempseed, a pianist active in the UK from around 1900 until the 1930s. More ambitious than the Suite in terms of its scale and emotional range, the Sonata in C minor for two pianos was first performed by Sherwood and Hermann Scholtz under the auspices of the Dresden Tonkünstler-Verein on 27 April 1896. The work's gestation is documented in the autograph manuscript held by the Bodleian Library, in which Sherwood noted the dates on which he completed the second, third and fourth movements over the course of a few weeks in April and May 1890. First performed in 1877, the Duo appeared in print in the same year as part of Breitkopf und Härtel's high profile 'Klavier-Bibliothek' ('Pianist's Library') series - the first edition of Parry's music to be published abroad. Perhaps recognising the new opportunities that international recognition might bring, Parry also relinquished his insurance job in 1877 in order to focus his efforts on developing a career as a composer, teacher and writer. Despite inhabiting a quite different sound-world to Parry's later choral works - such as Blest Pair of Sirens, with which he is now indelibly associated - the Duo therefore emerges as a pivotal work in his early career and musical development.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=SRCD368&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Piano,United Kingdom,2019 Lyrita Recorded Edition,2019 Lyrita Recorded Edition,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The recording features the Boys' Choir of the Moscow Sveshnikov Choral College and the Leningrad Chamber Orchestra of Old and Modern Music, one of the best chamber collectives of the 1970s and 1980s in this country, led by Eduard Serov. All three musicians had been educated in the school of Alexander Sveshnikov, one of the greatest figures in Russian music culture of the 20th century. A prominent choirmaster, educator and tireless enlightener who was at the helm of the best choral collectives and music educational establishments of this country, Sveshnikov will also be remembered for his numerous pupils who continue the traditions of Russian choral culture. This 1981 performance of the St John Passion at the Grand Hall of the Moscow Conservatory was marked with the highest professionalism, a refined sense of Bach's style and in-depth comprehension of the performed music. It could be rightfully called a deserved monument to the prominent choirmaster's achievements. Among the other soloists, we should note outstanding interpreter of chamber music Alexei Martynov as the Evangelist and an owner of rarely beautiful and expressive bass Anatoly Safiullin as Jesus. The St John Passion was performed for the first time on Good Friday of 1724 in one of the churches in Leipzig shortly after Bach received the post of cantor there. For the composer, it was the first and extremely important opportunity to show his worth before the townsfolk and at the same time check the performing capabilities of the choristers and musicians he supervised. Later on, Bach performed the St John Passion on a number of occasions, but after his death the work shared the lot of most of his works and was consigned to oblivion. The St John Passion was performed again as late as in 1831.

Despite a 200-year gap between them, the music of these composers has much in common. It is the versatility of the genre palette, the combination of daring and bold innovation and the sense of continuity, an acute awareness of the tragedy of earthly existence while maintaining an objective attitude to the art. A deeply personal touch is heard in the chamber music of both composers, the music associated with the tradition of home music making and a leisurely friendly conversation. Mozart's Divertimento in E-flat major written in the year of the "Three Great Symphonies" (1788) is associated with the name of Michael Puchberg, Mozart's friend and patron, and also a fellow Freemason. What makes the piece unusual is its six-movement structure and a sad, almost tragic ending while preserving the major sound on the surface. Alfred Schnittke's String Trio (the composer was a close friend of Mark Lubotsky who was a dedicatee of his three violin sonatas) was written in 1985. This is a tragic confession of the artist, a synthesis of the sharpest sense of modernity and timeless, eternal values of being. The recordings feature Mark Lubotsky's long-standing ensemble partners who together have been known as "Lubotsky Trio" since 2003: the famous Swedish violinist, violist and conductor Katarina Andreasson, and the cellist and acknowledged master of modern music performance Olga Dowbusch-Lubotsky.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=MELCD1002566&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Russia,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"The great and noble human essence of Benjamin Britten equally nourishes any manifestations of his musical genius; Britten's works are his self-portrait of the man," wrote Mstislav Rostropovich about Britten. The most eminent English composer of the twentieth century, who, after a two-hundred-year hiatus, again raised the musical tradition of Britain to the heights of the musical Olympus, fulfilled his creative potential in a variety of genres. The composer's connections with Russian music and musicians were significant, but Rostropovich was the one with whom Britten had the closest friendly and creative contact. Under the influence of the genius performer's art, Britten returned to instrumental music. So, he wrote a cello symphony and a cello sonata for Rostropovich. The cycle of Suite (No. 1) for solo cello, which Dmitri Shostakovich ranked among to the best chamber pieces, followed. For a decade, Britten worked on a cycle of three cello suites, in which he combined the compliance with Baroque examples, echoes of European neoclassicism of the twentieth century and unlimited admiration for the art of Mstislav Rostropovich. Like Shostakovich's famous Eighth Quartet, Britten's suites contain self-citations from his other works, which help expose their figurative and symbolic programme; the last suite contains citations from Russian folklore and Orthodox songs as a sign of a profound creative connection. The art of the greatest representative of the Russian cello school inspired many composers and brought to life one of the brightest creative pages of the genius British composer. Benjamin Britten's cello suites are performed by Alexander Ramm. A graduate of the Moscow Conservatory where he studied with Professor Natalia Shakhovskaya, one of Rostropovich's students, Ramm, who recently celebrated his 30th birthday, is a prize-winner of the prestigious international competitions, including the prize of the Geneva-based Neva Foundation in 2011 and a silver medal at the 15th International Tchaikovsky Competition in 2015.

From the lyrical Trio, to the powerfully poetic title work for baritone and piano, to the romantically-inclined Sonata, From the Valley of the Baca demonstrates the composer's ability to express his artistic vision in a wide variety of musical genres. The harmonic language and brooding character of the Trio, which recalls the introspective character of Shostakovich's String Quartet in C minor, op. 110, is balanced by Carpenter's penchant for long, lyrical lines, particularly in the Trio's second movement. Carpenter cites two sources of inspiration for his song cycle From the Valley of Baca, one musical and one poetic: His work Job for baritone and piano, based on the book from the Hebrew Bible, sparked the idea of writing a song cycle based on the poetry of the Jewish-American author Emma Lazarus. One of Lazarus's, poems, "The Valley of Baca," which references the 84th psalm, also inspired Carpenter to intersperse the verses of this psalm, set in its original Hebrew, throughout the song cycle, serving as a counterbalance to the English texts of Lazarus's poems. In 2015, Carpenter composed a work entitled Rhapsody for pianist Katelyn Bouska as a companion piece to Chopin's Piano Sonata in B minor, op. 58, both of which Bouska performed at a recital in Paris that year. At Bouska's behest, Carpenter added two movements to this composition to form a sonata, employing a sighing, chromatic motive from the Rhapsody to bind the three movements together. Emphasizing again that the past informs the work of many artists, something of Chopin's musical style, as well as that of other Romantic-era composers, finds voice in this new work. While he has drawn musical inspiration from past masters, Carpenter's music is intended neither as a pastiche of earlier musical styles nor an anachronism.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwuUAbb-IKA&feature=youtu.be,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=NV6208&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Chamber Music,,,2019 Navona Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For most, creating art in the realm of somber moods poses challenges. For the Renaissance Men, the melancholic nature of their musical exploration is not only achieved individually but shared amongst the talents of the vocalists. The Renaissance Men approach these compositions with conviction. Darius Milhaud's Psaume 121 is no less expressive without the brass fanfare that listeners are used to. Between the powerful bass and towering high tenor, the Renaissance Men breathe life into the song, evoking emotions that only the human voice can bring to a listener. The Renaissance Men pay homage to compositions including Pablo Casal's O Vos Omnes; Patricia Van Ness' Psalm 3; and The Lamentations of Jeremiah by Thomas Tallis; among others. The ensemble approaches these compositions with the finesse employed by their composers. Compositions written by instrumental performers are translated by the choir, reimagining the intricacies of the string instruments with the rich power of the human vocals. But power also comes in the words expressed through composition. The religious text communicated by the choir tells tales of sorrow and faith, and of lessons found in the Old Testament.

This Navona Records release moves through waves of contemplation on life, history, and the evolution of spirituality through the performances of violin, cello, and piano by acclaimed pianist Karolina Rojahn. After a colleague of Vollrath's at Troy University listened to the pieces, he told the composer that the first Trio reminded him of images he had seen of ancient Peruvian cave paintings. Indeed, the moments of intensity paired with thoughtfulness in the first movement conjure up a feeling of awe, much like one might have when viewing these paintings created by hands thousands of years gone. Repeating motives with subtle differences, sometimes presenting deep, resonant tones in the lower registers of the strings, other times presenting brisk pizzicato, slurred runs, and climbs to the height of each instrument's voice, all form a sense of wonder and mystery. Trios II and III act in much the same way. Trio II is inspired by the ancient Egyptian ritual of bringing food to tombs to give meals to the deceased on their journey to the afterlife, with the idea being that the dead are not really gone but rather are in another place. Trio III looks into the Buddhist faith, reflecting on its extensive history and considering how religion evolves just as man does. Between Vollrath's balance of intensity and contemplation in his writing, and the dynamic performances of virtuoso Rojahn and the Summa Trio, Souls In Transitions is a moving performance that demonstrates the power of musical motives and the piano trio.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYmrvznrs5s&feature=youtu.be,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=NV6212&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,,,2019 Navona Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nonetheless, key similarities bind them together, and Sustain explores just that. The latest multi-composer release by Navona Records, Sustain presents works for various keyboards that explore not only the abilities of each instrument, but the varied approaches from five different composers. John Dante Prevedini's Lyme Sonata begins the album, looking at the sonic interplay between smooth and jagged musical voices on piano. Robert Thomas' Moto Perpetuo and Sixteen Lines Circling a Square create an audial puzzle on solo marimba and on marimba and vibraphone, respectively. Working through layered structures, each piece involves finding the answer to some mental and sonic games. Willem Van Twillert's Adagio for Piano and Andante for Antoinette presents the composer's serene, smooth, and in this case romantic, approach to writing music. Daniel Adams introduces Solstice Introspect for three vibraphones. Inspired by the feelings conjured up by the winter solstice, where the day is at its darkest and feelings of both peace and unsettlement are stirred up, the three vibraphones play with the opposing forces of movement and stillness. John A. Carollo's Piano Etudes and Piano Suite No. 9 take listeners on a multifaceted journey inspired by the romantic sensibilities of Franz Liszt, the intensity and mischievousness of author Edward Gorey's story Doubtful Guest, and more.

This dramatic performance, inspired by the hundreds of letters exchanged between Dunbar and his wife, Alice Ruth Moore, removes the masks of fame and social identity to investigate the psychological realities of the people underneath. Driven by pivotal moments in the poet's life, the chamber opera follows the arc of Paul and Alice's relationship, from their courtship through letters, secret engagement and marriage, to their final estrangement and Paul's death from alcoholism and tuberculosis at age 33. Throughout these moments, the audience gets a look behind the known storyline into the psychological challenges occurring beneath the surface for both Paul and Alice. Both characters grappled with the fact that they came from troubled relational backgrounds filled with abuse and apathy -- much of which was translated into their own marriage. In addition, both struggled with their racial identity in a culture that generally judged and discriminated before it sought to understand. The dramatic tension of their personal relationship and story, fused with the broader questions surrounding identity, appearance versus reality, and grappling with the person in the mirror, makes this a moving story on the operatic stage. Captivating, challenging, and compelling, The Mask In The Mirror is a necessary look into fame and identity as seen through this hero of African American poetry.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpLHd_kjldg&feature=youtu.be,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=NV6209&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Chamber Music,,,2019 Navona Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

And indeed, his new album Resistance may just offer the best of both worlds in one captivating experience. Each piece has certain features in common: they are immediately, intuitively accessible to the listening ear, and all of them draw upon Baxter's ability to evoke sincere emotions with every note. The compositions that make up Resistance each come with a story to tell. Starting off the album is The Silver Run, a soaring depiction of The Silver Run area in Maryland as told by the voices of flute and piano. This stunning soundscape is followed by the passionate Could You Dream What I Dream for violin and piano, matched only in romantic quality by Romance Without Words and Il y a Longtemps (""Long Ago""). This expression of love is followed by Des Larmes Encadrées ("Framed Tears"), a sentimental reflection inspired by his familial ties with a fellow artist who plays the saxophone. Resistance, the title track, is a triumphant stance in favor of tonal, lyrical music in an age of atonality and the breakdown of harmony. Its power is balanced by the dark yet deeply moving story of MacPherson's Lament, inspired by Scottish fiddler James MacPherson and his last composition, written just before his hanging. On the other hand, Ballade For A Princess, inspired by Chopin's Fantasie-Impromptu, reflects the beauty and romance portrayed in so many of that Romantic composer's compositions. These powerful, moving sentiments are tastefully balanced by the guitar duo Edgefield, in which Baxter melds traditional rhythms with a highly innovative yet understandable way of modulating through different keys. From the Headwaters aptly brings Resistance to a close, tying in the harmonies of its predecessor with the lyricism of the rest of the album.

The poems of Sarojini Naidu (1879-1949) cover a wide range of human experience, from love, ecstasy, delight in the natural world, loneliness, acceptance and praise. These five poems form a cycle of one Indian woman's experience. Her poetry pulsates with her love of Indian landscapes, seasons and flowers, simple joys, devotion and the splendor of Indian festivals. I chose an accompaniment of string quartet and clarinet to extend and enhance the richness of Naidu's imagery and the passion she evokes. In 1980 I discovered in an old bookshop a book of Chinese children's' songs in English translation called Chinese Mother Goose Rhymes. Published in 1900 it includes, as well as the texts in Mandarin and English, I chose fourteen poems to make a cantata for children, accompanied by two pianos with optional percussion, recorder and harp.

This album includes a rendering of the composer's magnificent violin concerto featuring star violinist Leila Josefowicz, orchestral score Photoptosis, as well as the first album recording of Die Soldaten Vocal Symphony based on an opera that is widely considered as one of the greatest German operas of the 20th century. Zimmermann wrote his Die Soldaten opera, one of his keyworks, during the 1950s and 60s. The premiere of the opera was cancelled, and upon hearing the claim that the opera would be 'impossible' to perform, the composer adapted parts of the opera into a 40-minute vocal symphony suitable for concert performance. This work, filled with power and drama, is much more than a description of the apocalypse of modern war, and deserves its rightful place alongside the operas of Alban Berg. Zimmerman's Violin Concerto is a relatively early work in the composer's oeuvre. It was premiered in 1950 but has suffered much neglect. The influence of Schoenberg, Hindemith, Bartók, Stravinsky and Prokofiev are visible in this work which we might consider to manifest echoes of war. Photoptosis (1968), 'Incidence of Light', is among Zimmermann's final orchestral pieces. Inspired by a painting created by Yves Klein for the Gelsenkirchen music theatre, this work includes quotations by Scriabin, Beethoven, Bach, and Wagner, among others. Yet, this "Prélude", as described by the composer, is not a collage, but a study in orchestral sonority and light. Recordings by the Finnish Radio Symphony Orchestra under Hannu Lintu on Ondine have gathered excellent reviews in the international press. Two of their recordings were nominated for Gramophone Awards in 2018.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=ODE%201325-2&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Finland,"2019 Ondine Oy, Helsinki","2019 Ondine Oy, Helsinki",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2019,Ondine,ODE 1314-2,0761195131428,Johannes Brahms; Hubert Parry; Arnold Schoenberg ,Brahms-Schoenberg: Piano Quartet in G minor; Parry: Elegy for Brahms,Gavle Symphony Orchestra,1,CD,13.25,20.99,"This new recording by Gävle Symphony Orchestra with conductor Jaime Martín is a tribute to the work of Johannes Brahms (1833-1897). The art of Brahms has inspired countless of artists and composers since the 19th century up to our times. Arnold Schoenberg was one of the composers who greatly admired Brahms' work. Schoenberg was particularly fond of Brahms' 1st Piano Quartet (Op. 25) and when Otto Klemperer suggested him to orchestrate it in 1937, Schoenberg took the task without hesitation. Schoenberg regarded his reworking of the Piano Quartet - often dubbed as 'Brahms' Fifth' - as an act of homage to Brahms, and he believed he had finally succeeded in addressing the composer's concerns about the original score. No wonder that Schoenberg's masterful arrangement has remained in the concert programs of symphony orchestras. English composer Sir Hubert Parry (1848-1918) wrote his orchestral work, Elegy for Johannes Brahms, in 1897 in memory of his recently deceased musical idol. This short symphonic movement, which makes some overt references to Brahms's music, was never performed in the composer's lifetime, and only received its premiere after Parry's own death in 1918. After that, it languished unplayed until it was again resurrected in 1977. After decades of neglect, this recording is a manifestation of the recent growing interest in Parry's music. Gävle Symphony Orchestra, founded in Sweden in 1912, has a long and exciting history. Since 2013, the orchestra has enjoyed a fruitful musical partnership with principal conductor Jaime Martín, but the orchestra has also collaborated regularly with renowned international conductors. This is the orchestra's fourth album to be released by Ondine. Jaime Martín became the Artistic Director and Principal Conductor of Gävle Symphony Orchestra in 2013. During recent years orchestral engagements have led the rising conductor to collaborate with several prominent orchestras around the world. Martín is also Chief Conductor of the Orquestra de Cadaqués and known for his active career as solo flautist.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=ODE%201314-2&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Finland,"2019 Ondine Oy, Helsinki","2019 Ondine Oy, Helsinki",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The honor included the opportunity for Harnoncourt to choose a piece of music which he could then perform with the orchestra in an ideal atmosphere. Harnoncourt surprised everyone by choosing Haydn's virtually unknown oratorio based on the apocryphal Bible story of Tobias, who goes on an adventurous journey with the angel Raphael in order to heal his blind father with the angel's help. In keeping with the spirit of the subject matter, the proceeds of the concert were given to a charity supporting war victims of Sarajevo. The work was performed under Harnoncourt's direction with an ideal lineup of soloists and the magnificent Arnold Schoenberg Choir at a 2013 Salzburg Festival concert in the Felsenreitschule. The release by Orfeo International of the live recording, which is almost devoid of background noise, is only the third-ever recording to have been made of this very seldom performed Haydn oratorio in the history of phonography. Yet again one is moved to ask why so many of Haydn's operas and oratorios are so rarely played.

After a thorough music education and a firm grounding in the art of conducting operas he soon began to assume more elevated positions on the music scene. The extent of his success in the 1950s was so great and indeed so rapid that by 1957 he was given the privilege of conducting at Bayreuth. That said, the most decisive period of his career was probably from 1971 to 1992, when he enjoyed huge success with the Bavarian State Opera in Munich, both in the city and worldwide. He was initially appointed General Music Director, and in 1982 was promoted to State Opera Director. It was in the Bavarian capital that he expanded his role as a highly diversified, top-notch musical director. His wide-ranging, active repertoire was founded on three mighty "pillars", namely Mozart, Wagner and Strauss, each of them very safe in his hands. One of his legendary achievements is his complete cycle of Wagner's operas, a feat he achieved in 1983, and the Orfeo catalogue includes excerpts from the first of Wagner's operas - Die Feen, Das Liebesverbot and Rienzi - which are now acknowledged as benchmark recordings. It is well known that Sawallisch was an excellent pianist who would play chamber music or accompany singers from time to time, and the Orfeo catalogue features Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, Hermann Prey, Bernd Weikl and the very first Orfeo album of all: Schubert Lieder with Margaret Price. Recently released excerpts from Don Giovanni and Così are proof that he was capable in the 1970s of conducting fiery Mozart performances, while his Puccini and Rossini recordings are testimony to his mastery of the Italian repertoire. What is more, the Orfeo catalogue contains several digital studio recordings of symphonic repertoire by Bruckner, Pfitzner and Weber as well as the Brahms Requiem, interestingly featuring the "colleagues" from the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra.

Richter approaches the notion of Heimweh from several perspectives: from that of queens, young girls and shepherds to that of soldiers, dwarfs and gravediggers. The repertoire consists of the original, German-language version of Ave Maria, three Mignon songs (Nur wer die Sehnsucht kennt, Heiss micht nicht reden and So lasst mich scheinen), the sinister Der Zwerg, the expansive flower ballad Viola and many others.

Cast in nine movements, divided into three parts, it paints a vivid portrait in sound of the Spanish region, its landscapes, its people, folk-culture and traditions. It is the major piano composition by Manuel Font y de Anta, who was born in the region's capital of Seville on 10 December 1889. He is still well-known in the region thanks to a pair of religiously themed wind-band marches, which are unofficial anthems for the city, particularly during Holy Week. Font y de Anta studied music with his father, the composer Manuel Font Hernández, with the Chapel Masters of the Seville Cathedral Vicente Ripollés and Eduardo Torres, and with Joaquín Turina. During his early twenties he toured the US as a pianist and conductor before settling in Madrid, where he became known as a composer of popular songs and marches. He died in the city, aged just 46, at the hands of Communist militia in November 1936. Andalucía mostly dates from 1913-14, except for two movements composed in 1918 and 1921. The cycle begins with an impressionistic evocation of romantic yearning, En el parque de Maria Luisa, and it's followed by two, briefer, more extrovert pieces. The central Cuaderno begins with Alhambra, an even more sensuous, nocturnal love scene set in the gardens of the palace. A dance movement with a central barcarolle is followed by the cycle's most ambitious and complex piece, Perchel. A sultry evocation of the mosque at Cordoba leads into the poetic masterpiece of Andalucía, En un patio sevillano. The cycle concludes with a virtuosic showpiece, En los Toros. The cycle as a whole is a worthy successor to Ibería and Goyescas. It is championed here by the Italian pianist Riccardo Schwartz, a pupil of Paul Badura-Skoda.

Schumann, Mussorgsky and Rachmaninov were the giants of the past who seized the young Shamo's attention, and traces of their impassioned, lyrically centered idioms may be discerned throughout the early works on the first portion of this new recording such as the Ukrainian Suite, Classical Suite and Shamo's own take on Pictures at an Exhibition in his suite of Pictures by Russian Painters. The second portion is occupied by two more substantial cycles, of 12 Preludes from 1962 and six impressionistic Aquarelles from a decade later - both the appreciation and execution of painting was important to Shamo throughout his life. The final portion gathers up piano pieces throughout Shamo's career, from the Marche fantastique, which so impressed the professors of the Kiev Conservatoire when the composer elected at the last minute to play it for his entrance exam, to three dances composed in 1972 and inspired by the folk culture of nearby Soviet republics, Armenia, Azerbaijan and Uzbekistan. A counterpoint to their uncomplicated charms may be found in the three Songs of Friendship from 1954, in which Shamo treats melodies from Poland, Romania and what was then Czechoslovakia. Though jazz and minimalist techniques periodically surface in Shamo's music, it bears the stamp of its Soviet times in its generally sunny character and clearly laid-out forms - though the serenity of the Ninth Prelude is answered by the machine-gun-fire Tenth, and Bartók casts a shadow over this music almost as often as Prokofiev. Dmitri Tchesnokov is, like Shamo, a native of Kiev, born in 1982 and long resident in France, where he pursues a career as both composer and pianist, as well as founding a directing a well-established festival of contemporary piano music in Paris.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=PCL10152&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Germany,2018 Piano Classics,2018 Piano Classics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He builds up rich musical textures by sampling violin and cello live and folding them back into the mix, influencing the performers in turn. German electric cellist Ulrich Maiss, a former collaborator of Lou Reed and Al Di Meola, joins Morris on B4ch1007 (""Bach Loot""). The piece is a vivid, glitchy fantasy on J. S. Bach's music, with inspiration from Lou Reed's classic Metal Machine Music and a video graphic score reminiscent of early experimental film by Hans Richter. Morris uses sound to visually distort the manuscript of Bach's famous Cello Suite, yielding a new musical score to read. This audiovisual reimagining is native to our time while gleaning some underlying musical intuition from the flow of Bach's music. Eric KM Clark (Southland Ensemble, California E.A.R. Unit) performs a tryptich of improvised works in different interactive environments: a virtual string quintet, a tangled strand of echoes, and a microscopic journey inside the materials that make up the violin itself. Morris controls these musical constructs live, which are inspired by a house of mirrors and Einstein's daydream of riding beside a beam of light. Using control interfaces like a gamepad and Nintendo Wii Remotes (Wiimotes), Morris takes a variety of roles in the music, ranging from a performer alongside Clark to a digital conductor of his own software orchestra.

Apparently a lot, provided they are cut from the same cloth as multi-faceted composer Phil Salathé, the brains behind Imaginary Birds: Music for Oboe and English Horn. The commissioned duet Mandarin Ducks is as much a natural observation as it is a musical piece of work: With the precise gaze of an ornithologist, Salathé illustrates seven enchanting anatine scenes. Fittingly, these short pieces roam about in free form - just as their natural subjects would. The title also nods to the recent marriage of the two performers, oboist Ling-Fei Kang and Charles Huang on English horn, as mandarin ducks are known for their lifelong fidelity. The upbeat start of the album soon grinds to a halt, however, in The Heart That Loves But Once. Inspired in title and style by the music of Robert Schumann and interspersed by the chilling whispers of a celesta, the rhapsodic work chronicles the disheartening state of a lover who finds his desires unattainable. Imaginary Birds of the Frozen North harks back to an avian theme, musically depicting three very different birds with an accuracy that is equal parts surprising, hilarious, and astonishing: a proud, leery ostrich, a dodo anxious of its forthcoming extinction, and an enigmatic screech owl. The Wood Between The Worlds takes the listener on a walk through a mystical landscape and conjures a cryptic, ethereal kind of beauty. The secret highlight of this mini-cycle is indubitably "IV. A World Shrouded in Forest," in which the composer fuses his multifarious musical influences into an evocative portrait of not only the world he is painting, but also of a highly recognizable compositional style. Expecting the Spring Breeze rounds off the album with Salathé's arrangement of a lyrical melody composed by Teng Yu-hsien, completing the overarching natural theme of Imaginary Birds.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8IT1ZTox_g&feature=youtu.be,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=RR8006&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Brass & Woodwinds,,,2019 Ravello Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Looking at their technical scope, it is not difficult to see why: Busoni, a true-blue composer in the original sense of the word, possesses an original, eclectic style that is difficult to categorize. Pianist-performer Svetlana Belsky, who first discovered her love for the musical creator during her doctoral studies, thus insightfully avoids any attempt at stylistic classification, but rather interprets each and every piece with great respect to the particular work's inherent nature. Since Busoni's pieces, individually taken, run the whole gamut from a late-Romantic, occasionally even classical aesthetic to borderline atonality, one would expect a coherent interpretation to be a truly fearful challenge. But this is where the magic sets in: Marrying awe-inducing technical capabilities to an artistic intuition of mind-boggling depth, Belsky manages to enter the inner sanctum of Busoni's creative thought, no matter the style, with miraculous panache. The pianist effortlessly captures the soul of the piece, regardless of whether the composer furiously tears down form and tonality in Sonatina Seconda, whether he reminisces in Chopin's lyricism in his Nine Variations, or whether he allows himself a rather off-color compositional remark by citing ""Greensleeves"" in Turandots Frauengemach. Belsky makes all these eccentricities sound perfectly plausible, imperative even; and she may well be the first pianist to accomplish this feat. Ferruccio Busoni: The Late Works, therefore, marks a new high point in the performance of the often- misunderstood composer; and Svetlana Belsky's innate understanding of her kindred spirit may well inspire a historic turning point in the public perception of Busoni's oeuvre.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRrfvgD4Igc&feature=youtu.be,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=RR8007&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Piano,,,2019 Ravello Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In 1739 he published Les Saisons amusantes, concertos by Antonio Vivaldi arranged for bagpipes and hurdy-gurdies. These transcriptions of concertos from Cimento dell armonia e dell'inventione include arrangements for the hurdy-gurdy of three concertos from the Four Seasons.

His anthem, The Call of Wisdom, was performed at the Queen's Diamond Jubilee celebrations with a TV audience of 45 million people. His breakthrough work, Mass in Blue (originally titled Jazz Mass), has been performed hundreds of times all over the world. Passion Music was commissioned for the choirs of St Martin-in-the-Fields and continues the fusion of jazz and choral music so successfully blended in Mass in Blue. The structure highlights different points in the Passion story, beginning with a new setting of 'Greater love has no man' and including an evocative Stabat Mater, a movement focusing on the seven last words of Christ, and a setting of 'Were you there when they crucified my Lord?'. The Jazz Missa Brevis gives new life to the sung Latin Mass texts in an accessible, short setting which embraces a variety of jazz styles, from the swinging jazz waltz Kyrie to the up-beat Latin-groove Gloria.

Religious conflict and wars that involve it are constantly in the news - but we rarely hear enough about the affirmative aspects of our many faiths, such as the phenomenal beauty of the varied cultures surrounding them. Exploring these cultures has unearthed a bounty of stunning chant and verse and has brought me closer to my own personal spiritual beliefs.' 'Each work on this release focuses on a particular mood or sentiment around the theme of love, expressed in a musical language that echoes the origin of the words. I've drawn on texts from different faiths, from the 15th century Zen Master Ikkyu Soyun to the well-loved 13th chapter of 1 Corinthians; from the Christian mass setting to the 14th Century Sufi poet and mystic Rumi, to the ancient Hebrew Psalm 136 (135). And I've married a traditional Anglican text with a Catholic one - creating a truly Ecumenical Magnificat. Within the music you will hear fragments of Spanish Sephardic chant, Christian plainsong, Sufi rhythms and a Japanese lullaby, to soothe the soul.'

Fresh from rave reviews for The Hills of Dreamland, a ravishing collection of Elgar's orchestral songs, Kathryn Rudge returns with a delectable recital of era-defining songs by the composer of the stirring The Dam Busters March, exuberant Knightsbridge march and the timeless By the Sleepy Lagoon, familiar to radio audiences around the world as the theme to BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs since 1942. The dreamy reverie of that signature song, so evocative of a more innocent age, is matched here by the carefree rustic knowingness of Reuben Ranzo, the Four Old English Songs, the affecting melancholia of The Green Hills of Somerset and the exquisite four-part song cycle The Mill o' Dreams. Coates belongs to an era of gentler music-making but a no less passionate and emotional one, as Rudge's ardent singing of Sea Rapture, her beseeching approach to I Pitch My Lonely Caravan and honeyed take on The Fairy Tales of Ireland eloquently testifies to. Kathryn Rudge has been described as "one of Britain's brightest young mezzos" (What's on Stage) with her voice lauded for its "tremendous reserves of power, impeccable intonation, the capacity for a gloriously sustained legato and, most interesting of all, a distinctive vocal quality" (The Times). Christopher Glynn is fast emerging as one of the most exciting young accompanists of the day. Opera News has described him as "an exemplary partner, by turns impossibly delicate, colourfully nimble and thunderously firm", while the Birmingham Post praised his partnering in concert of fellow SOMM artist Roderick Williams for its "reassuring authority and empathy".

Pairing the piano music of Arnold Bax and Harriet Cohen, his latest release includes eight first recordings and promises fresh insights into the music of a revered English master and revelatory performances of an overlooked composer who subsequently found fame as a pianist. The result, Private Passions, is an illuminating dialogue between one of the pre-eminent British composers of the last century and his muse who together shared a 42-year-long love affair. The eight first recordings here include Bax's vitally contrasted Four Pieces from 1947 and Cohen's evocatively colored Russian Impressions - the first documented public performance of which Bebbington gave in London in 2015 - a suite dating from around 1913 that variously hints at the influence of Mussorgsky, Debussy and Glinka. Heard here in its original version, Bax's E flat Piano Sonata of 1921 (which prompted the composer's First Symphony) is as vivid and rich a statement as he ever made. Completing the album is Bax's In the Night (Passacaglia), an evocative piece that owes much to the intimacy of his relationship with Cohen, and Legend, boasting music of grandeur and poetry wholly suited to its title. Mark Bebbington's previous release with SOMM featured piano concertos by Grieg and Delius - "A Grieg concerto the equal of any I have heard, the most enjoyable version of the Delius concerto I know and a novelty world premiere to boot.

From my very early age I experienced singing and music at home, but most of all, I remember visiting the Opera house when Father sang. As soon as Father began to sing, I recognized him, it was easy. He sounded 'different' than the rest of the ensemble. My Father was in his early 30s and had then been singing for 25 years. Already at the age of four to five, my Father and his brothers began to learn the essentials of the art of singing under my grandfather David's solid guidance. I have spent a great deal of my life exploring the secrets of the Italian bel canto, conveyed by David and my Father, and I have reached the conclusion that there are no secrets; it is just the natural voice that has to be heard, free from settings and so-called tone formation."",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=CDA1832&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Art Song,United Kingdom,2019 Sterling Records,2019 Sterling Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In 1726 Couperin published his own musical atlas. According to the most plausible reconstructions based on the surviving manuscripts, the author had picked up three sonatas from a series of six trio sonatas written on Corelli's model of "sonata da chiesa" (four movements, typically alternating slow-fast-slow-fast). These three chosen works were renamed this way: La Pucelle became La Françoise, La Visionnaire turned into L'Espagnole, L'Astrée into La Piédmontoise. To these three works Couperin added a fourth, the most extended of all, called L'Imperiale. To each Sonata, he further added a French Suite whose length suited diplomatic protocols: eight dances each for France and Spain, nine for the Holy Roman Empire, six for Piedmont. In all, four ordres for those Catholic powers that, in a typically French-centred perspective, were considered natural allies in the effort to break the siege by a hostile geopolitical bloc: Anglican Great Britain, Lutheran Prussia and Sweden, Orthodox Russia.

A thought that is at the same time permutating and persistent, attentive to micro variations and sensitive to the sudden cataclysms of sound. Its material aspect, of physical energy, is confronted with chemistry: a particular type of chemistry, electronic chemistry, that is, the informed use of contemporary technology as a support and extension of the possibilities of instruments, their dilation in the space/time of listening.

The composer would take Susil's extensive collection of traditional Moravian songs along with him wherever he travelled. The texts from the volume were used for the majority of the Songs on One Page, Songs on Two Pages and The New Chapbook. Just as Dvorák had done in his Moravian Duets, so Martinu conceived his own tunes and accompaniment, yet his having been profoundly impacted by folk music, its rhythm, melody and harmonic techniques is palpable. Created in the early 1940s, in the middle of World War II, during the composer's exile in the USA, the three song cycles represented for Martinu and his compatriots a connection with their beleaguered homeland. Jan Masaryk, a Czech diplomat and a skilled amateur pianist, often performed the songs together with the soprano Jarmila Novotná, a MET soloist. Owing to their elliptical expression and modesty, the three cycles may serve as the clue to Martinu's late works. The New Slovak Songs constitute a unique piece in the composer's oeuvre; he himself had collected them during his visit to Slovakia in 1920 and subsequently wrote for them piano accompaniments. Three renowned artists, bearing an authentic relation to folk music and Martinu's work alike, have made a benchmark recording, in which they have succeeded in highlighting the songs' tender beauty.

Adopting some traditional forms of the profane music of the Renaissance, such as the canto a ballo and the romanesca, and using ritornellos and refrains interspersed with different formal systematisations (nos. 1 and 5), Marini created complex, dynamic pieces, achieving a splendid synthesis of all the composition elements.

It refers to the musical reaction we can have vis-à-vis paintings or texts. Take the Five Meditations on Stained-Glass Windows, for instance: the original stained-glass windows featured scenes from the Old and New Testaments. My music is by no means an attempt to "describe" those stories; rather, it is the outgrowth of my very personal, individual thoughts and emotions. My approach is like that of a book illustrator. The music should not attempt to recount the story; rather, quite differently, it offers an independent commentary on the events. I apply the same approach in my "musical commentaries" on Dietmar Scholz's textual aphorisms. The music does not literally depict "the lonely hair that becomes important by falling into the soup", but tries to grasp the meaning hidden behind the text. This becomes particularly apparent in the case of Scholz's aphorism "In a mirror, everything is similar and everything is the opposite": this textual content can be musically depicted as a form. In the same way, my musical setting of the Romanesque Frescoes is not a description, but a commentary."",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=TLS244&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Contemporary Era,Germany,2018 Grill Medien,2018 Grill Medien,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During his time as a student, he was already making waves in the world of film composition, working on projects including the British comedy "Save Angel Hope" starring Billy Boyd, where he had the opportunity to record a feature film score with full orchestra at the age of only 21. Most recently he has written the score for I Krig & Kaerlighed, one of the highest budgeted Danish feature films of all time.

But Blitzstein was also a fine pianist and wrote for the instrument all through his career. This first album ever devoted entirely to his piano output offers a conspectus of 45 years of Blitzstein's music, from lyrical juvenilia via spiky protest pieces and jazzy dance numbers to intimate 'family' pieces for close friends. The pianist is the Blitzstein expert Leonard Lehrman, whom Leonard Bernstein called 'Blizstein's dybbuk', and who for decades has been one of the leading Blitzstein scholars.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=TOCC0438&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Germany,2019 Toccata Classics,2019 Toccata Classics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Celebrating Women, are both grand statements in a proud American tradition of Neo-Romanticism, accessible, direct and sincere. Of the premiere performance, one reviewer wrote: "Adsum-Celebrating Women was a tour de force, whose title comes from the Roman rite of ordination when candidates are called by name and answer "Adsum- Present!"

Most of Tod's handful of works for the organ - solo and as a duo partner - have not been recorded before; here they are joined by three other little-known German organ sonatas to give an overview of the genre as it evolved from its well-behaved Mendelssohnian origins into late-Romantic grandeur. International organ virtuoso Dr Jan Lehtola is one the most successful and progressive Finnish organists of his generation. He has appeared with the Finnish Radio Symphony Orchestra, Tapiola Sinfonietta, the Lahti Symphony, Tampere Philharmonic and Ostrobothnian Chamber Orchestras and the St. Michel Strings. He has performed at many international festivals, including the Lahti Organ Festival, Kuhmo Chamber Music Festival, and the annual Festival of New Organ Music in London. He has worked with conductors including Kent Nagano, Juha Kangas, Sakari Oramo, Muhai Tang and Osmo Vänskä, amongst others. Dr Lehtola has also given recitals in leading European concert halls such as Gewandhaus in Leipzig and cathedrals and churches such as La Trinité in Paris, St. Thomas Church in Leipzig, St Paul's Cathedral and Westminster Abbey in London.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=TOCC0505&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Germany,2019 Toccata Classics,2019 Toccata Classics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In "Clair Obscur - Colors of Saxophones", extreme contrasts play a defining role: beautiful and ugly, loud and soft, bright and dark - all these qualities are brought to life by the Berlin saxophone quartet, clair-obscur. The musical spectrum ranges from Old Masters to the extreme fringes of contemporary music.  Cri Muet for saxophone and orchestra brings together tender lyricism and machine-like rhythms, along with Beethoven quotations and contemporary atonal harmonies. As Times Go Bye for alto, tenor, and baritone saxophone plays with the concept of time using motivic material from Johann Sebastian Bach. In Pavane, old and new meet in the contrasting sounds of saxophone and English Horn as well as in references to the music of the Spanish Renaissance composer Luis de Milán. In Berlin Punk, Enjott Schneider attempts to transpose the attitude and character of Punk culture into a symphonic setting. Rough, loud, dirty, insolent, and aggressive, yet also lyrical, poetic, and yearning: this is the impressive emotional range that is radically achieved in the virtuoso performances by the members of clair-obscur.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=WER51192&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Contemporary Era,Austria,2019 Wergo,2019 Wergo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Apart from early works and large musical drama projects, his output consists primarily of two large-scale cycles. The first contains nine works, including Minnesang (1975-76) for twelve vocal soloists: a mystical and spiritual work that translates the medieval art of Minnesang into modern terms and whose musical effects are founded on the intelligibility of the texts. Nunes also composed a number of pieces not included in these cycles, among them the orchestral work Musivus, which was written for Expo '98 and premiered in a revised and expanded version in Cologne in 2001. Musivus is "a monument of spatialization" that can make the listener dizzy with its tiny fields of musical activity that bloom into a gigantic visual and acoustical mosaic that is extremely changing to a traditional, process-oriented way of listening.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=WER73782&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Contemporary Era,Austria,2019 Wergo,2019 Wergo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There are only 19 songs officially verified as Chopin's works, all of them inspired by lyrics of his contemporaries poets. Most of Chopin's vocal compositions were published after his death and combined as Op.74. The poetry of Adam Mickiewicz inspired Ignacy Jan Paderewski to work on a cycle regarding love, longing and passing of the time. Six songs were created between 1887-1893. Paderewski died in New York after having a remarkable European and American career as an outstanding pianist, composer, philanthropist and politician. The Twelve Kurpian Songs, by Karol Szymanowski demonstrates the composers fascination in simplicity, vitality and energy, going side by side with an expression of the Kurpian dialect. In the cycle, Word Songs to words by Julian Tuwim, the listener can hear a fantasy world, hidden between music lines and lyrics by Julian Tuwim. Word Songs were composed in the summer of 1921, Karol dedicated them to his sister - Stanislawa Korwin-Szymanowska, who was also the first interpreter of these vocal works.",https://youtu.be/KZeBKiwwF90,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=ZEF9661&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Vocal,Netherlands,2018 Zefir Records,2018 Zefir Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
