They're typically Handelian in character, in that the upper voice is very vocal, like his operas. The melodies are truly captivating and remarkable for their "simplicity" which demands far more virtuosity than simply moving the fingers quickly. The goal of Stefan Temmingh, one of Germanys most renowned recorder players of the younger generation, is to come as close as possible to the greatest of all instruments - the human voice. The bass line makes an equal counterpart to the recorder part; it's opulent, virtuosic and full of variety - much more than in comparable pieces. It's executed without cello only by harpsichord, performed in an outstanding way by Wiebke Weidanz.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=ACC%2024353dig,01 Classical,Classical,,Austria,2019 note 1 music ,2019 note 1 music ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The two artists had grown close. A memorial exhibition was quickly planned, and over four hundred of Hartmann's works were displayed. Some of the paintings and sketches exhibited were the source of inspiration for Mussorgsky as he set out to compose "Pictures at an Exhibition," a suite of brief movements penned in June 1874 - three months after the exposition took place. Seemingly depicting the viewer wandering through the gallery, moving from one painting to the next, the piece has become one of the giants of the piano repertoire, and has been orchestrated by a number of composers, including the splendid version by Maurice Ravel. "Pictures at an Exhibition" is one of François Dumont's warhorses. In the present album, alongside the celebrated suite, the French pianist offers a selection of rarely heard piano works by Mussorgsky. They hail from two very different periods - his early years, and the very last year of the composer's life. They offer a glimpse into Mussorgsky's pianistic skills, and are heavily influenced by Russian folklore and traditions. François Dumont's career was launched by his success in major international piano competitions, including one of the top prizes in the 2010 Chopin Competition in Warsaw.

Bloch's detailed knowledge of the piano literature of the last three centuries, his familiarity with the entire history of music and its protagonists along with his stupendous pianism and above all things his strong artistic personality form the basis for the much vaunted depth of expression, the abundance of color, the amazing stylistic originality and the incomparable "singing tone" of his playing, manifesting themselves equally in the careful composition of his recitals.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=ARS38507,01 Classical,Classical,,Germany,2018 Ars Produktion,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It's Mendelssohn who comes to mind in the vernal surge of energy that opens the First Piano Trio which is Arensky's best-known work beyond his piano music. The sombre third-movement elegy is a tribute to the cellist Davidoff, and accordingly opens with a soulful cello melody, before an impassioned finale banishes all introspection. Composed over a decade later in 1905, the Second Trio replaces such youthful energy for a more concise and refined harmonic idiom that even brings to mind Gabriel Fauré at points such as the polished, elusive second-movement Romance. After a delightfully capricious Scherzo full of subtle rhythmic shifts and conversational hesitations, the Second Trio concludes with an expansive set of variations on a noble theme in Tchaikovskian vein. Formed in 2016, the Carducci Trio has already won praise for its accomplished performances of Russian music in particular, having recently made a tour of China and given London performances at the Royal Albert Hall (Elgar Room) and Academy of St Martin in the Fields.

The 90 preludes composed by Alexander Scriabin (1872-1915) span the entirety of the three periods into which his musical career is usually divided. His fastidious habit of indicating the date and location of compositions allows us to trace groups of roughly contemporary pieces. Consequently, it can be seen that around half of the preludes fall into the 'first period' (1888-1900), in which the composer's music was heavily influenced by Frédéric Chopin's work. Scriabin's music evolved over the course of his life, and in 1900, he completed the 2 Preludes Op.27. These compositions exorcised the spirit of Chopin which had hovered over their predecessors, therefore marking the end of the so-called 'first period'. Whilst more harmonically adventurous, his 'middle period' works still mostly adhere to traditional functional tonality. In the third period (1910-14) Scriabin composed his final works, the Preludes Op.74. Stable tonality and key signature disappear completely. However, Scriabin's interest in symmetrical patterning is highly evident. They raise the tantalising question of where Scriabin might have taken 20th-century music had he not tragically died the following year. Russian pianist Dmitri Alexeev is one of the world's most highly regarded artists. His critically acclaimed recitals on the world's leading concert stages and concerto appearances with the most prestigious orchestras have secured his position as one of 'the most remarkable pianists of the day' (Daily Telegraph).",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=BRI95651,01 Classical,Classical,,Germany,2018 Brilliant Classics,2018 Brilliant Classics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Just as the playing of Richard Muhlfeld had inspired Brahms to write his Clarinet Quintet and two sonatas, so Bruch discovered the melodies flowing from his pen once more thanks to his clarinettist son, Max Felix, to write the two works on this new album. Having composed no chamber music for several decades, he wrote the Eight Pieces for clarinet, viola and piano in 1909. They belong to the genre of character pieces by Schumann such as the eight Fantasiestücke Op.12, though they lean towards reflective introversion. The cycle's high-point arrives with the fourth piece, a Romanian melody introduced to him by a young and beautiful aristocrat, the Princess zu Wied. Two years later, having retired from all his official posts of teaching and performing, Bruch produced a harvest of choral and instrumental music including this lovely Double Concerto for clarinet and viola in E minor. The two solo instruments thread and entwine melody around each other in the manner of Brahms's Double Concerto: it's a rhapsodic work, full of his son's youthful high spirits, that captivates many listeners once they have encountered it, hardly less than the composer's First Violin Concerto, and a discovery well worth making for anyone not wholly in thrall to the tenets of Modernism which Bruch resisted so stoutly.

Quite unalike in personality, in artistic aims and language, the two nonetheless held each other in high esteem. Like so many other composers, Mompou began to write guitar music having met and been inspired by Andres Segovia. This friendship principally yielded the six-movement Suite Compostelana. A Baroque construction enclosing a flowing, arpeggiated Prelude, a crystalline Chorale, a searching Recitative and a deftly embroidered Cancion, the Suite is entirely original in its themes with the exception of the joyful stamp of the finale which is based on the Muiñeira de Lugo, a typical Galician dance usually played on a form of bagpipe known as a gaita. In complement to the Suite Compostelana, Marco Ramelli adds a pair of the Cançons i danses, transcribed from the piano originals for solo guitar. These poetic miniatures, mostly gentle in mood, were a kind of diary for Mompou, compiled one by one throughout his career. Their reserved Impressionism perfects a particular personality belonging to 'The Spanish Guitar'. Roberto Gerhard brought its more extrovert side to life with a sequence of incidental music written for a TV adaptation of Ernest Hemingway's novel For Whom The Bell Tolls - made in England, shortly after the composer had moved there as an exile from the Spanish Civil War. For this recording, Marco Ramelli has used a guitar built in 1931 in Barcelona by Francisco Simplicio, one of the most important Catalan luthiers. Its intense and raw sound forms a native counterpart to both the poetic moods of Mompou and Gerhard's dissonances.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=BRI95679,01 Classical,Classical,,Germany,2018 Brilliant Classics,2018 Brilliant Classics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tension runs high throughout the opening Modéré before breaking into a violent Scherzo in the manner of Bartok's Music for Strings, Percussion and Celesta. Shostakovich and indeed the Second Symphony of Arthur Honegger may be called to mind by the impassioned lyricism of the slow movement, which rises from darkness before discovering a point of radiant transfiguration in the movement's coda. Restless counterpoint brings the finale to an exhilarating, emphatic conclusion. The first recording of Castérède's symphony won a Grand prix du disque, but it has taken half a century for the second to be made by this young and exciting Dutch string ensemble as the centrepiece of their debut on CD. Turbulent energy and sombre elegy are the key signatures of the imaginative programme: Honegger's Second Symphony of 1937 explores the same expressive territory as Castérède's Symphony, though its trumpet-led apotheosis achieves hard-won resolution. Reflective miniatures by Koechlin, Honegger and Saint-Saëns are highly coloured by their composer's individual voices, and there is space for the heartfelt Adagio of Guillaume Lekeu, which belongs in the company of Mahler's Adagietto and Barber's ubiquitous Adagio.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=BRI95734,01 Classical,Classical,,Germany,2018 Brilliant Classics,2018 Brilliant Classics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The cycle was later incorporated within The Book of Abbeyzoud, an album with a character suspended between the Biblical, the mystical and the exotic. Francesco en Paraiso is a tender memorial to the countertenor Frank Royon Le Mée (1952-1993). The cycle continues with an Indian melody, and a melancholy lament before ending with a sultry Tango Ladeado (Tango Off-Centre). Hardly less substantial is Muse of Fire (1990) by George Rochberg, written in the shadow of the Gulf War: hence the sudden stops and starts, the military evocations, the funeral marches, the moments of dream-like lyricism and the rhapsodic soliloquies. Ora pro nobis (1991) is based on the slow movement of Bach's Italian Concerto: a plea for release at a deeply troubled time. Bateau is a song from the 2003 album Ceramic Dog by Marco Ribot, who works mostly with jazz and post-rock musicians: this is the work's first performance on classical guitar, and Alberto Mesirca brings out the delicate textures that evoke light shimmering on water. Of similar aquatic origins, Fish Tale is a 'watercolor for flute and guitar' by Osvaldo Golijov: 'I wanted everything to be beautiful,' said the composer, 'even at the expense of some sense.' This unique compilation concludes with shorter solo pieces alternating between flute and guitar, taking in the satisfyingly intricate textures of Crawford Seeger and Wuorinen at each end of American modernism, as well as a touching elegy by Mark Delpriora in memory of a student of his, Basil Keiser.

He played them in his own recitals and recorded some of them for a German label. Only in 2018 did these arrangements become more widely available for keyboard players thanks to a new Bärenreiter edition prepared by Siebe Henstra at the invitation of Leonhardt's widow Marie and daughter Saskia. With typical understatement, Leonhardt declared that 'I think Bach would have forgiven me for the fact that I have set myself to making arrangements of his works. Whether or not he would have forgiven the way I have done it, remains of course a moot point.' The Cello Suites, the Sonatas and Partitas for solo violin and a pair of slow dances (originally for flute and for lute) now receive their first recordings not made by Leonhardt himself, and at the hands of an early-music keyboard player who has enriched the Brilliant Classics catalogue with acclaimed recordings of Telemann, Frescobaldi, Bach and much more. Leonhardt's transcription of the great Chaconne from the D minor Partita is as rich and thrilling as to be anticipated from one of the sovereign Bach interpreters of our age (or any other), discreetly opening out Bach's implied harmonies without adding superfluous anachronisms. In some ways more enlightening and impressive are his elaborations of the Cello Suites' plainer textures. Much more than a curio, this significant new album demands the attention of all Bach devotees.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=BRI95757,01 Classical,Classical,,Germany,2018 Brilliant Classics,2018 Brilliant Classics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Silvestrov distinguishes himself from those contemporaries by the sharpness of his ears and the freshness of his thinking. Silvestrov's Fifth Symphony achieved a cult status among dissident Soviets and then in the West through the gradual dissemination of a recording made in 1976. The loving adieus of his later music have come about through an immersion in the Western avant-garde, with Webern as the fountain-head, that unlike Pärt he has not so much disowned as refined. This is music perpetually on the threshold of saying goodbye, wholly in love with the Viennese classics and yet regretfully aware that their world is irrecoverable. The 10-minute Epitaph for cello and piano is one of several works Silvestrov composed in memory of his wife Larissa, who died in 1999. The Hymn of 2001 dedicated to Kancheli is significant and touching out of all proportion to its brevity: according to the composer, 'all melodic content from my other compositions can also be found here. A rest does not only constitute a lack of sound, but is also a state of retardation and paralysis or a suspension of time. In early music, there was an occasional need for silence, but here it is a fundamental feature.' This new album also contains some first recordings. Principal among them is the song-cycle Moments of Poetry and Music, setting a text by Paul Celan in Russian translation. Made live at a concert in Brussels, the recording is led by the pianist Alexei Lubimov, a longstanding friend of Silvestrov and authoritative interpreter of his music.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=BRI95765,01 Classical,Classical,,Germany,2018 Brilliant Classics,2018 Brilliant Classics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Before 1800 few important cello concertos were written - with the exception of works by composers of stature such as C.P.E. Bach, Haydn, Boccherini and Vivaldi. The latter's typically inventive and diverse cello concertos with eloquent slow movements are almost certainly the very first composed for this instrument. That most of the great cello concertos were composed after the Baroque or Classical period is rather ironic, since the ever-larger orchestral forces of the 19th century and beyond required much more care from the composer to avoid overwhelming the solo cellist in the lower register. Dvorák scored his magnificent cello concerto (1894-5) for a weighty orchestration, containing three trombones and tuba, but his experience enabled him to judiciously manage the solo/orchestra balance. The result is an epic work brimming with melodies and embracing a wide range of emotions. Alongside Dvorák, Schumann and Saint-Saëns brought full recognition to cello concertos. In 1850, Schumann's cello concerto became the first major concerto for this instrument since Boccherini's examples from 1780. 20th-century composers have made the cello a standard concerto instrument. Among the most notable from the first half of the century is Elgar's, composed in 1919, in which the English composer explores introspective and meditative expression. Polish composer Witold Lutoslawski, one of the outstanding musical minds of the latter half of the 20th century, employs avant-garde techniques in his concerto (1969-70) along with the typical drama of soloist/orchestra confrontation.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=BRI95782,01 Classical,Classical,,Germany,2018 Brilliant Classics,2018 Brilliant Classics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

First to be composed of the works here is a Danza caracteristica from 1956. A popular song melody forms the basis for an Afro-Cuban flavored fantasy. The Fugue No.1 dates from the following year, when Brouwer was still a teenager: having outlined a theme of Baroque proportions he takes a fairly free attitude to its contrapuntal elaboration, anticipating the concise play of fantasy in the Tres Apuntes of 1959. Having soon after moved to the US, Brouwer composed the first two books of the Estudios sencillos out of financial necessity, but they have proved among his most enduring and successful works, drawing energy not only from his Cuban heritage but the didactic economy of the Mikrokosmos by Bartók. Almost all of the third and fourth books from the series date from 1981; although Brouwer had both moved back to Cuba by then as well as moved on in his own style towards a more neo-romantic language, he rediscovered the lively economy of thought which runs through the earlier studies, combining it with both neoclassical harmonies and even chance procedures to produce among the most significant collections of guitar studies from the second half of the last century. 'These short pieces reflect all of Brouwer's creative genius,' says Frédéric Zigante, 'and I have always been fond of them, first as a young student of guitar and later as a guitar teacher. To me, they are an ideal method for weaning young guitarists from the didactic repertory of the 19th century.'",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=BRI95838,01 Classical,Classical,,Germany,2018 Brilliant Classics,2018 Brilliant Classics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

(...)

Bach wrote the work in Leipzig in 1734 and 1735 for Christmas Day, Boxing Day, the third day of Christmas, New Year, the Sunday after New Year, and Twelfth Night. As with the Passions, the texts here are drawn from three sources: the evangelical texts intoned by the Evangelist as recitatives, chorales from the Lutheran tradition and free texts for arias and some choral passages, written by the poet Picander. This performance is perhaps as close as presently possible to what we imagine Bach might have had in mind as he composed the work in Leipzig. First of all, we have the 'one to a part' aspect: historical research among the various sources clearly shows that Bach did not ask for a choir to perform his cantatas, but simply a vocal quartet. This 'single line singing' certainly adds to the individual expression of the text and the music's transparency. Bach's religious music always uses the text as its starting point and a great deal of attention is therefore paid to correct enunciation. The vocal principle of 'one to a part' also has a major influence on the instrumental forces. Bach employed a small-scale string ensemble, as well as single wind instruments where appropriate, all supported by an organ, which formed the continuo in conjunction with the bass violin. And since the instrumental music is also completely permeated by the rhetoric that stems from the text, the transparency of this small ensemble intertwines seamlessly with the vocal lines, giving a refined polyphony that reached its zenith in Bach's music.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=CC%2072806,01 Classical,Classical,,Austria,2018 Challenge Records Int. ,2014 Challenge Records Int. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is celebrated in several languages. The Russian Church belongs to this rite and celebrates it in the Slavic language. It is therefore here spoken of as the liturgy in the Byzantine-Slavic rite. Missionaries from Constantinople brought this rite with them along with the Christian faith to Russia. Until into the 16th century the Russian Church was dependent upon Byzantine patriarchs. St. John Chrysostom was archbishop of Constantinople. The degree to which the present form of the liturgy-bearing his name may be traced back to him remains a matter of controversy. For certain can be said that this form of the liturgy originated in Antioch where John Chrysostom was a monk and then for a period bishop, and that it developed in Constantinople into the form known today; this process was completed only in the 14th century. In the beginning, a longer form of the liturgy, that of St. Basil, was more commonly in use. Today, however, it is celebrated only on certain days of the year, among these on all Sundays of Lent. With the Byzantine liturgy the Russians also adopted the Greek-liturgical chant, which was then during the course of the years completely russianized. The oldest Russian melodies designed for liturgical use are in the so-called neumatic style. During the course of the 17th century other chants of the Byzantine churches were also incorporated into the Russian chant books. Among these were melodies written in "Kiev signs" and the chants of the Greek, Serbian, and Bulgarian type. Sergey Rakhmaninov made a variety of references in his through-composed setting of the liturgy to the century-old tradition which gave him at the same time stimulus for his own superb ideas.

The piece in question is perhaps the most orchestral of them all and utilizes the bulk of all the instrumental registers on the organ in order to construct, in Reger's own words, a miniature symphonic poem for Organ. In this music, Reger operates with highly expressive intervals, and alternates the cantus firmus in all the voices of the texture. A noteworthy highpoint of the composer's output is Wachet auf, ruft uns die Stimme op.52, 2, which contains some of Reger's gravest, most profound, and moving music. The stark chromatic lines and dark instrumental colors depict a most otherworldly and visionary atmosphere. Halleluja! Gott zu loben, bleibe meine Seelenfreud op.52,3 is the last of the big chorale fantasias. The word-painting of the text is again remarkably mirrored in the music, in the tradition of Bach.

With La dame blanche (1825) he even produced one of the internationally most successful works of this genre; it served as a model example for other composers and played a significant role in the further development of the opéra comique. François Boieldieu received his early training in music in particular from Charles Broches, the organist at the Rouen Cathedral. In 1796 he went to Paris, where he met Cherubini. From 1803 to 1811 he was the court music director in St. Petersburg, and in 1817 he became a professor of composition at the Paris Conservatory. In the overtures of his opéras comiques Boieldieu usually anticipates thematic material from the particular opera. As a result, the overture not only prepares the listener for the atmosphere and tone color of the particular opéra comique but also provides for a recognition effect when the themes familiar from the overture reappear in a later phase of the stage action.

Danzi's ""Preis Gottes"" cantata continues to breathe the spirit of the eighteenth century and of Mozart, for example, in the highly virtuosic arias for soprano and tenor, while the choruses suggest the oratorios of Handel and Haydn. By contrast, his short Psalm 128 op. 65 for mixed choir and smaller orchestra is painted in delicate romantic colors. It was published in Leipzig in 1823 with the Latin text and the German translation of the psalm by Moses Mendelssohn, which Louis Spohr, a friend of Danzi's, also used in his Three Psalms op. 85 for double choir (1832). Fesca proves to be a master of the transition from classicism to romanticism - and very much the equal of his boss Danzi, with whom he apparently was on good terms.

After years of style shaping and sound experiments, Meis' 4tet is about to make its mark on the European jazz scene with a sonic vocabulary that skillfully blends the traditional palette of drums, trombone, piano and double bass with the fresh approach and the broad musical background of open-minded and fearless musicians. The result is an exciting modern jazz where free and experimental improvisations meet well-crafted compositions. Where a rhythm, bursting with energy and vivacity, meets introverted and lyrical melodies. Where conventional jazz elements meet a clever and subtle use of jungle beats and electronic sound effects. Although a true powerhouse drummer, Michel Meis gives enough room for the other instruments to unfold, thus emphasizing the cohesiveness and harmony of the project.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=DMCHR71354,02 Jazz,Jazz,,Austria,2018 Challenge Records Int.,2018 Challenge Records Int.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is in this spirit of musical conversation that these two musicians present this release.

Two of the cantatas are inspired by Greek mythology; the third celebrates the sweep to victory by the rose plant in the gardens of the French aristocracy. The continuo group of the Ensemble 392 does not include a string bass, quite in keeping with traditions of Baroque performance practice at that time. And yet there's one aspect, which, from a historical perspective at least, is quite intriguing. Italian cantatas were wildly popular across Europe, so why not French cantatas as well?

The Pierre de la Rue masses on this recording have one thing in common: they are all based on monadic models, thus in keeping with the most traditional of cyclic mass composition models, the cantus firmus mass. Yet in their individual construction they could not be more different. Two of these masses employ just one single cantus firmus. The one based on the secular melody L'Homme Arme is the earliest of them all. L'Homme Arme was the most common secular cantus firmus of all and composers who wrote a mass based on it were aware of competing with their contemporaries.

They both have an interesting story, just as the others. In 1943, the authorities asked Shostakovich to write a work that would pay tribute to the Soviet Union and the future victory. When the war ended in 1945, everyone was expecting the symphony, but it was not ready, even the first part was not completed. Instead of a grandiose apotheosis of victory and Stalin, on 3 November 1945, at the opening of the 25th season of the Leningrad Philharmonic Orchestra with Yevgeny Mravinsky, a chamber symphony was performed, which the composer described as "a sigh of relief after dark and tough times, with a hope for the future". The symphony was subject to all kinds of criticism not only in the Soviet Union but also beyond its borders, including the United States. In 1948, it was excluded from the repertoire of the symphony orchestras. Shostakovich's works were rebuked (once again) as being formalistic and harmful, and the composer was fired from the Moscow Conservatory. Stalin's death brought him back to active creative work and on 17 December 1953, the premiere of the 10th Symphony, Op. 93 took place again with the Leningrad Philharmonic Orchestra and Yevgeny Mravinsky. It is not clear exactly when it was created: according to the composer's letters - between July and October 1953; according to pianist Tatiana Nikolaeva, it was written in 1951, and excerpts from Shostakovich's archive materials mention the year 1946. But the disputes of the year of creation do not change the fact that the symphony is one of his most dramatic and philosophical works. For the first time in his symphonies, we see the appearance of the theme-autograph - the musical monogram D-Es-C-H based on the initials of D. Sch. as per the German transcription. In the third movement, we can hear yet another new theme (E-A-E-D-A), which encrypts the name of Elmira Nazirova, a pianist and composer, a student of Shostakovich. All this defines the 10th Symphony as one of Dmitry Shostakovich's most personal and autobiographical works.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=GD386,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Orchestral,Bulgaria,2018 Gega New Ltd.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition to expressive toccatas and canzones, there are also verses from three Masses that are performed alternately between organ and choral choir. On two very well restored original instruments, Fabio Vonizzoni brings not only his modernity and self-confidence, but also an almost ideal balance of passionate freedom and formality.

We played the first bars of one of the fantasias on a whim, perhaps subconsciously wishing to find a light-hearted contrast to what we were working on. The incredible beauty and clarity of the music took hold of us straight away, in a way that no other music had affected us till then. Our faces brightened up and we knew that these gems would stay with us. From then on, we began each rehearsal with one of the fantasias. This new light was rather like an awakening for us. We began to include the fantasias in our concert programmes. As a result of the enthusiastic audience reaction and our collaboration with the wonderful Richard Gwilt we decided, over time, that we would take possession of these works.

Even in the few sonatas composed for pedagogical purposes, the dramatic genius of Mozart that had been sharpened by opera reveals itself. In all his sonatas the astounding, simply inexhaustible melodic richness is perfectly balanced by clear proportions and an osmosis between form and content, and with a dreamy, almost playful lightness. In the two minor-key sonatas, on the other hand, Mozart is shockingly tragic, unexpectedly uncompromising, and on a par with Beethoven in terms of dark, surging power. One particular aspect, however, seems to me to be frequently neglected: the typical Mozart humour. Capricious, mischievous, childish, playful, parodying, affectionate etc - there are not enough adjectives to describe the wit of Mozart. Astonishingly, this humour never has a hurtful or injured tone but is, on the contrary, always deeply gracious and humanistic. The emotional spectrum of Mozart's humour, with all its diversity, is always focused on the light."",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=HC18068,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Piano,Germany,2018 Profil Medien,2018 Profil Medien,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sparr not only lives on the mystical high plains of the Wild West, he also embodies an unconfined nature when it comes to making music. As comfortable playing a guitar concerto with a major orchestra as he is employing Tibetan singing bowls and banjos for a film score, his ears are as open as his horizons are wide. Electric Bands brings together four of his works for electronically-improved chamber ensembles; a format that allows for moments of magical realism. You might detect traces of layered Nancarrow-type rhythms deftly executed with guitar pedals or you might not; either way, Sparr's effortless combination of composer-thinking and guitarist mind make his music as satisfying for the head as for the heart. I Can Hear Her Through the Thin Wall Singing for electric guitar and soprano imagines what kind of song cycle Debussy might have written if he'd had the full range of modern guitar effects available to him. Meta444 was inspired by a conversation between Killer Mike and Stephen Colbert. It is traditional ritual music for a religion and a place that exists only in the imagination. Sparr's string quartet, Avaloch, for the Momenta Quartet, sprang from a place that very much exists- Avaloch Farm Music Institute, New Hampshire- and its attendant apple orchards and walks in the woods. But it's a place where time is illusory, and the inhabitants are free of stress and dance with boundless joy. Earthcaster Suite was composed for a documentary about artist Thomas Sayre. Sayre's work blends art and science, addresses the past and future, and joins the natural and man-made in a sometimes-dangerous dance of gravity and grace.",Plugging into the fantastic,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=INN013,01 Classical,Classical,,,,2019 D.J.

From Colorado to Marseille, Iowa City to London and Boston, Emissions Transparents documents his far-flung visions and musical adventures. The title track, Emissions Transparents, features Pablo Gomez on electric guitar with the Callithumpian Consort of the New England Conservatory directed by Stephen Drury. This five-movement composition explores invisible communications- be they radio transmissions, angelic apparitions, or ghostly voices from the unknown, that manifest Elwood's interest in the paranormal and interstellar space travel. Since he was a teenager, Elwood has been drawn to the New York School of composition from the 1950s and 1960s that highlighted composers John Cage, Christian Wolff, Morton Feldman, and Earle Brown. Elwood has been fortunate to work under the baton of Cage and to perform on a couple of occasions with Wolff. He commissioned Wolff to compose a work for solo banjo, the result being the aptly-named "Banjo Player," completed in 2015. This is the premiere recording of this virtuosic tour de force. Two tracks on the recording were improvised with percussionist Eddie Prevost of the legendary AMM ensemble, during a long and leisurely summer Sunday afternoon session in London 2016. Ashe County Lament features pianist Rose Chancler and the voice of Freight Hoppers alum, Carrie Fridley, singing the Appalachian folk tune The Girl I Left Behind. The track mixes live piano with manipulations of Fridley's voice- all reflective of both Elwood's background in folk music and her fascination with electronic sound design. Another stellar voice on the album is that of Aly Olson with the University of Iowa Percussion Ensemble singing text written specifically for this project by poet Albert Goldbarth, two time National Book Critics Circle Awards winner.

This is their tribute; a gift to the world in troubled times. The Compassion Project is comprised of two albums. The first, entitled Compassion: A Journey of the Spirit, features 15 of the Compassion compositions and was released by EMI/Angel in 2001 to critical acclaim. This album is packaged together with Innova's release of the new second album that includes world premiere recordings of additional Compassion works and a piece written by Lukas Foss for the opening of the 1980 Winter Olympics performed by Yehudi Menuhin with Orson Welles narrating a poem by W. H. Auden. The 24 Compassion works were written for and dedicated to Menuhin and Michell. It comes as no surprise that the violin is central to almost all of the works. In their individual program notes, the composers mention such ideals as international understanding, or the nower of music to bring spiritual strength, or elements of simplicity and innocence. All reflect different responses to the life and humanistic work of a single great man: "Twenty-four styles with a noble theme behind them," as Michell puts it. Menuhin took great pleasure in this collaborative project, and had plans to record it and to continue performing it with Edna Michell in many parts of the world. She recalls that during a concert when they played some of these pieces in London, only a month before he died, he turned to her as they walked off stage and said "Edna, we must record these pieces now!" He believed the works should be performed together in one program because, as Michell says," they create a very special ambiance."","Edna Michell, Yehudi Menuhin, and friends around the world dedicate their work to universal compassion through music",https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=INN971,01 Classical,Classical,,,,2018 Cantilena Productions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When coining this word, I tried to encompass these pieces beyond the usual preludes, interludes, etc. I have tried to give each Metaludio its own character, with distinguishing features that define its identity and differentiate it from the next.

The accurate reference to the etymological origin of the term (from the Greek mystikós whose first meaning is about something arcane and mysterious) not only reveals the intention of discovering the timbre and expressive effects of the viola but to inducing composers to penetrate into their mysterious world through the works composed for this occasion. In this sense, interpreter and composers have achieved their purpose, without a doubt; Ana María Alonso discovering the subtleties of the viola´s timbre through a technical and expressive refinement of the highest instrumental conception, and the ten composers, each from their creativity, constructing an enriching musical poetic discourse, not only for the violistic repertoire, but for the music itself.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=IBS-192018,01 Classical,Classical,,Spain,2018 IBS Artist,2018 IBS Artist,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nevertheless, each of them faced such a challenge depending on their particular circumstance, sensitivity and idiosyncrasy. In their own way, the three composers featured on this album summarize a historical, social, cultural, and geographical framework of thrilling eagerness, sometimes evanescent. Guridi and Sorozabal culminated their career in Madrid: the former acclaimed by the academia, the latter blessed with popular success, although condemned to an inner excile because of his dissident and controversial nature.

Augestad's repertoire for "Portraying Passion" takes the musical qualities of modernist, individualistic composers and places them squarely within the context of the 21st century. Paus' contemporary composition enhances Ives' visionary dissonance as well as the contrasting melodic shifts of Weill's orchestrations, yet brings something entirely new to the table, with its startling text and cabaretesque presentation. Parker and Brecht could just as well walk arm in arm down the conceptual pathway of understated satire, counterbalanced by the ethereal, transcendental text of Ives' songs, forming a complementary whole. Add Augestad's unique approach to these works into the equation, and the listener is served with a program certain to make them re-examine any former assumptions, and delight at the outcome. And therein lies the timeless dimension of this mezzo-soprano's considerable artistry. Tora Augestad is an artist equally at home in concert halls, theater and cabaret stages, and contemporary music arenas.

In 1985 he visited EMI Studios in Sydney Australia to make this album of music by Australian and American composers. However for several reasons it was put to one side and when the studio closed it was believed that all copies were lost. Last year a cassette copy was found, transferred and remastered. It is a wonderful collection of works, performed with McCabe's usual dazzling virtuosity and deep musicality. The album comprises works of differing styles best summarized as 'post-modernist' - individual, inspired, contemporary but not unfriendly to audiences; some are impressionist such as the title track by Peter Sculthorpe; jazz-inspired (Rochberg's Carnival Music) and all are fine additions to McCabe's recorded legacy.",https://youtu.be/UysW3IsVThs,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=MSV28585,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Piano,Austria,2019 Divine Art,2019 Divine Art,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

'Liquid Strata' is an important work in Subotnick's oeuvre. Here the electronic component is what he calls "ghost electronics," and this is the first of 11 Ghost Pieces. In these works, Subotnick sought to address technology in a way that highlights rather than compromises the inherent features and strengths of acoustical instruments. In the Ghost Pieces, Subotnick pre-recorded the vocal "energy shapes" on tape. These audio signals were played back (but not heard), combined with sine tones, and sent to an envelope follower. The voltages generated trigger Buchla-produced pitch, amplitude, modulation and stereo panning. All of the Ghost Pieces are to be performed live on a proscenium stage, with speakers in front of the performer. 'The Other Piano is a continuation of the Ghost pieces. The composer refers to the electronics as "a quadraphonic sound painting [spread] throughout the auditorium, done on the spot, intuitively, by a sound painter. ... one always hears the real piano and the transformations are a fantasy, changing in time and space, whirling around the room ..." Subotnick drew conceptual ideas for Falling Leaves from Scarlatti sonatas, a "sense of Scarlatti, but not derivative," particularly repeated notes, the virtuosic crossing of hands, and the idea of cadences. The early Preludes Nos. 1 & 2 are post-Webern influenced works. Prelude No. 4 is the first piece where Subotnick worked with the Buchla synthesizer. The electronic component is composed onto stereo tape, which is played alongside the live piano.

The album serves as a showcase of modern compositions for saxophone quartet which utilize extended techniques, and includes music by Michael Djupstrom, Marcelo Lazcano, Anthony Gatto, and Richard Carrick. The first piece, "Test," refers to the difficulty of writing for the performers. Michael Djupstrom wanted to make it a real challenge to play- and also signify that the work represents something new for the composer as well, especially in its harmonic language. This piece is followed by "Ser," which is built around the Buddhist phrase "We are what we think. Everything we are arose from our thoughts" from the Dhammapada. Next is the title track, "Plastic Facts," which is an expression the composer first encountered in the writings of architect Le Corbusier. The term "plastic facts" refers to basic architectural necessities that are constraints to work with, or bend somehow, to make something new and beautiful. The final piece, "Harmonixity," is a sonically inspired composition based on two different acoustical phenomena. One is the natural harmonic overtone of each saxophone and how its overtones change as it blends between the fundamental and lower harmonics. The second is the resulting harmony of acoustical reverberation, where a single line creates a sonic tapestry through its sustaining decay.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=FCR221,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Contemporary Era,United States,New Thread Quartet,New Thread Quartet,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The current program, meticulously played by Frederik Munk Larsen provides an overview of the composer's guitar music, from his first major composition, the dramatic and gestural Praeambula, Op. 72, (1974-1976) to the late, aphoristic cycle floating islands, Op. 169, (2002), unique in the instrument's literature for being composed entirely in harmonics.Borup-Jørgensen worked closely with musicians at every phase - from pre-compositional strategies to performance - among them, guitarist Frederik Munk Larsen, whose extraordinary virtuosity and attention to the most fragile nuance, draw out the deep melancholy and organic beauty of this fearsomely difficult music.

His craftsmanship was meticulous, his imagination colorful and sensitive, his piano writing as idiomatic as one would expect from a performer coached in the grand manner of 19th-century virtuosity. His voice is strongly established in even his early works: preludes, studies and ballades followed, as well as two grandiloquent sonatas. Many of Bortkiewicz's manuscripts ended up in the possession of his good friend, the Dutch pianist Hugo van Dalen. In time the Dutch Musical Institute acquired them and engaged Klaas Trapman to make these recordings between 2002 and 2006.

Conducted by Fergus Sheil, Eithne features a stellar cast of Irish singers including Orla Boylan, Robin Tritschler and Gavan Ring. The dramatic plot of Eithne is drawn from the magical legend Éan an Cheoil Bhinn (The Bird of Sweet Music). Composed by the English/Irish composer Robert O'Dwyer, the libretto was written by renowned academic and playwright Tomás Ó Ceallaigh. The story follows the adventures of Ceart, chosen heir to the High King of Ireland, and his ne'er-do-well brothers Art and Neart. Together they travel to the Land of Eternal Youth (Tír na nÓg) in pursuit of a mysterious bird. Unbeknown to the brothers the bird is Eithne, daughter of the King of Tír na nÓg. Cursed by her father, she must remain in birdlike form until a worthy warrior defeats the gigantic Guardian Spirit of their land, thus winning Eithne's hand and releasing her from the spell. The music of Eithne is immediately appealing, sitting firmly within the sphere of the late-nineteenth European operatic tradition, while also incorporating elements of Irish musical motifs. If the influence of Wagner occasionally looms large, the soft consonants, long vowels and in-line rhyming of the vocal score reveal the Irish language as completely apt for the operatic stage. The Irish Times in 1909 reported that the premiere of Eithne, conducted by the composer was '...enthusiastically received...' Its revival more than a century later was greeted by a full house in the National Concert Hall, Dublin and was described by critics as a '...remarkable revival of an intriguing opera.'",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=CD158,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Opera,Irish Republic,RTE lyric fm,RTE lyric fm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A storied, culturally-rich state, it has produced some of our country's most important artists - including William Faulkner, B.B. King, Leontyne Price, and Eudora Welty - but is also a place that has witnessed notably painful struggles with race, poverty, and equality. The scars are painful and deep. Here, among our colleges, churches, cotton fields and battlefields, contradictions abound. These disparate, but related, elements have long absorbed and confounded artists born in this mystical place. In recent years, I have come to see that my beloved state only reveals more intensely what exists in other places in our world: the struggle for people to come to terms with one another's histories and differences. In this time of turmoil between peoples and nations, focused on issues of citizenship and patriotism, we continue this struggle. I chose to name this album "Citizen," not only because it contains works that reflect upon actual citizenship and human rights, but also to highlight that we are all citizens of one earth, and in order to survive, we must find ways to respect one another's differences, and strongly uphold each other's right to exist with dignity and freedom. On this recording, I have gathered together works by composers who have contemplated these issues deeply. The voices of these artists plead for civility, humanity, and love, and each brings a sense of immediacy to the cause - offering not a clenched fist, but an open hand that reaches out with a welcoming embrace."",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=DSL-92228,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Piano,United States,2019 Sono Luminus,2019 Sono Luminus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although precise dates are still lacking, various clues have led many of his works for one/two instruments and basso continuo or concertante harpsichord to be moved forward to his Leipzig years (1723-1750) and in particular to the decade 1730-1740. This group of works also includes the three sonatas for viola da gamba and 'obbligato' harpsichord BWV 1027 in G major, BWV 1028 in D major and BWV 1029 in G minor, again assigned on the basis of clues to the period 1736-1741. On the other hand, no reference is available to date the posthumous copies of the Sonatas BWV 1028 and 1029 made in 1753 by Christian Friedrich Penzel, one of Bach's last pupils at the Thomasschule in Leipzig; but stylistic considerations would lead both works to be assigned to the same years as the Sonata BWV 1027. As is known, the three sonatas for viola da gamba do not form an organic corpus like the six Suites for cello or the Sonate e Partite for solo violin. But the pieces in the group share the 'obbligato' role of harpsichord, also found in the six Sonate à cembalo certato e Violino solo, datable to around 1725, as well as in the three sonatas for flute and harpsichord, written in the same period as the sonatas for viola da gamba.

Some of these phantom islands were preserved for centuries on maps, and only vanished with the improved navigational techniques of modern times. These islands may not have existed in fact, but they were nonetheless present and meaningful as imaginary objects. This makes them interesting as an aesthetic inspiration as well. In Oliver Schneller's Phantom Islands for 14 instruments and electronics, the idea of the emergence of elusive, illusionary objects plays a defining role in the timbral and formal structure: the composer describes his work as a kind of double concerto, in which the real instruments interact with their electronic reflections as counterparts. These virtual or "phantom" instruments are not exact timbral reproductions of their instrumental progenitor, but rather appear as though distorted by concave or convex mirrors. Their sound consists of electronically magnified or compressed acoustic refractions of the original instrument. When both sound sources intersect, the musical texture temporarily solidifies into characteristic and clearly defined acoustic shapes which resemble "islands" that suddenly appear from a transitory ocean, only to vanish again just as quickly. In terms of structure, the piece consists of a succession of sound "waves," from which arise compact structures which are then swallowed up by the following wave. Beyond these structural analogies, Phantom Islands offers parallels to the ocean. It plays with the refraction of light on the surface of water, and the middle of the piece refers to the calls of sea birds, while the epilogue makes reference to the song of humpback whales.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=TLS242,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Contemporary Era,Germany,2018 GRILL MEDIEN,2018 GRILL MEDIEN,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Swiss premiere of Bartók's Second Violin Concerto in 1946 marked the beginning of Hansheinz Schneeberger's long career, and as his country's most prominent violinist he has always been a forthright advocate of his homeland's often far too little-known music, rediscovering historic treasures, giving the first performances of contemporary works - often as dedicatee - and passionately promoting them. The recordings selected here for this musical tribute reflect the long period of Schneeberger's career from 1965 to 2001 and moreover give an insight into the many facets of the relationships between the various composers. Particular authenticity can be claimed for the world premiere recordings of Hans Huber's and Arthur Honegger's violin sonatas with Franz Josef Hirt, given that Hirt was taught the piano by Huber and went on numerous concert tours with Honegger.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=TLS235,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Contemporary Era,Germany,2018 GRILL MEDIEN,2018 GRILL MEDIEN,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But Jaques-Dalcroze, who studied with Delibes and Fauré in Paris and with Bruckner and Fuchs in Vienna, was a considerable composer in his own right, with operas, cantatas and orchestral works among his substantial output. These piano works, all written in the 1890s, are generally lighter in style, showing the influence of Schumann and the salons of Paris. Winner of several national and international prizes, the Milanese pianist Adalberto Maria Riva received a special mention at the International Competition of Music IBLA Grand Prize in 2008. This distinction allowed him to undertake a tour in the USA in April 2009 with a concert in Carnegie Hall.

Childhood is such a precious time in which rules of imagination and play reign supreme. These same rules govern the musings of fairy tales and also of music. Romanticism is more than an era: it is also an attitude towards life and, as such, is timeless. Perhaps it is more topical today than ever."",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=TXA18117,01 Classical,Classical,,Germany,2018 TYXart,2018 TYXart,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In my personal opinion there is no so-called authenticity in interpretation, which explains the maybe not so traditional but rather romantic approach to Bach and Beethoven. From an early age on, I developed a special relationship to Brahms, played and performed many of his works, and in this context it was very interesting for me to create my own cycle of his Intermezzi. Although they are from different times from Brahms's life and thus from different emotional phases, it feels to me that they harmonize ideally with each other, as well as in the overall program. They form the core of the idea for this album. Specifically, the Partita No.6 by Bach has a very personal touch - even the Fuga does not sound as strict as one is used to it otherwise, but rather leads to the romantic empathy. Stylistically, the work differs from the romantic, but in spirit it is very similar... Each program has a heart and this is basically a concert program and not a classic album production. So I would like to encourage you, my dear listeners, to actively respond to the programmatic content and especially to the soul of the music."",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=TXA18118,01 Classical,Classical,,Germany,2018 TYXart,2018 TYXart,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For this release, the young multi-percussionist Leonie Klein has collected a number of solo works that represent various stages in the development of New Music. Leonie Klein masterfully reveals each work's unique profile in the field of tension between composers' intentions and interpretational freedom. This collection displays multiple aspects of modern percussion music and is a representative exploration of an important area of New Music. Leonie Klein's interpretation of Karlheinz Stockhausen's Zyklus (1959), written for an orchestra of percussion instruments played by a single performer, is a kaleidoscope of sound colors. In Iannis Xenakis's Psappha from 1975, constantly changing rhythmic patterns depict musically structured periodicity. Helmut Lachenmann's Intérieur I (1966) gives life to exquisitely subtle sound events, while Nicolaus A. Huber in Póthos (2010) brings contrasting elements into harmony to reveal "the longing of one note for the next." In Thunder (1993), Peter Eötvös allows the timpani to achieve constantly changing pitches through the use of rapid pedal adjustments, and Johann Julius Fischer's repetitive Gathering (2018) for prepared vibraphone represents the current world of percussion music.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=WER73752,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Percussion,Austria,2018 Wergo,2018 Wergo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many of the works on this portrait album in the series Edition Zeitgenossische Musik were developed as work in progress during a long period of time. Distinctive for Obermüller's work are therefore the reflection from several perspectives and the superposition of different layers of sound. Zooming in on musical details is another special feature in several of her pieces as in "Pulstastung" for example. Here the distances between the musical occurrences are going to be extended more and more, "with an increasing pulse at the same time" (Karola Obermüller). Obermüller is receiving a special inspiration by ancient poetic texts as from the greek poet Sappho. Here she finds the essences of human existence like light and night, eros and longing. In ,,Untergegangen der Mond" and ,,...silbern." her music tries "to create moments of magic" (Volker Blumenthaler). In "Myrmecia" microtonal shiftings are confronted with percussive making of sound, which are creating a "strange, crackling, and insisting stream of sound", the composer compares to the wild activity of the primordial ant, the title is derived from.

Throughout his musical career, he has accumulated a vast number of stories, and those stories are woven into the fabric of his material. ""Bright Idea"", his trio recording with Jeff "Tain" Watts and Eric Wheeler, comes together in a way that embraces all of the places Murphy has been, from his grinding, intensive study in New York, his time in New Orleans with Ellis Marsalis, his pop-funk days in Chicago, and his Latin jazz work with Raphael Cruz. It is a well and fully rounded musical adventure, rife with dimension and color, and his most fully realized recording yet. At this point in his career, we would expect no less. Recorded, produced and arranged by Murphy, Bright Idea features mainly originals, with a few exceptions, including a torrid rendition of the Pharrell Williams tune "Happy." With Watts and Wheeler alongside, Murphy achieves an energetic vitality on the session, especially on tracks like the newly discovered Coltrane composition, "Untitled Original 11383," a twelve-bar blues, and Joe Ford's "Earthlings." But throughout the album there is generosity, reciprocity and the desire to make memorable and triumphant music. Bright Idea, Greg Murphy's second Whaling City Sound project and fifth overall, is his strongest statement as a leader and his most beautifully played collection of stories.
