It is an independent continuation of The Norwegian Broadcasting Company’s Girls Choir, established in 1947. The choir has an important place in Norwegian cultural life, and it has fostered a number of well-known singers, musicians and artists.

In 1709, the music-loving Landgraf Ernst Ludwig from Darmstadt had discovered him as a harpsichordist at the Hamburg Opera in 1709 and had hired him on the spot. The Landgraf had made a real stroke of luck with Graupner, because he was not only an outstanding musician but also a perfect organizer of the courtly musical life and especially for the church music which had to be performed weekly. Over the years, more than 1,400 works of sacred music and many concertos and orchestral works have gathered from his pen and paper. Dorothee Mields and Harmonie Universelle have put together an exquisite selection from this repertoire for the present release: three cantatas from Graupner’s early years as kapellmeister, complemented by two orchestral works.

The Second Quartet, on the other hand, was a much later and more complicated discovery for us. The writing is so personal, so unidiomatic for the instruments, so full of nuances, that to begin with we found it hard to come up with a unanimous voice for this work. The enthusiasm of the first movement can easily turn into anxiety if you push it a bit too far. In the slow movement, the texture is sometimes so bare that to convey its tenderness you have to sustain it with great fervour.

He wrote to Bartok: ‘You have convinced me to compose for our friend, who plays so fluently, a little piece whose diabolical difficulty will bring to life the Hungary of my dreams; and since it will be for violin, why don’t we call it Tzigane?’ Of course, Tzigane by Patricia Kopatchinskaja, who has been playing and dancing this music since her childhood in Moldova, does not sound like salon music . . .

Usually described as a Neapolitan composer, Alessandro Scarlatti had strong ties as well to Rome, where he spent about half of his active career. The fact that at least 40 of his operas survive from his first 18 years in Naples as maestro di cappella (1684–1702) – and he is likely to have written twice that many during that period– gives an indication as to his abundant creativity both there and in Rome, where he thrice lived and worked: as a young man, again while in his forties, and finally when approaching the age of 60. This set provides a rich sampling of Scarlatti’s vast output, with many great recordings not only of the vocal music for which he is most widely acclaimed –the duets, the comic intermezzos, the serenata La Gloria di primavera and the chamber cantatas, a genre he perfected, as well as the sacred oratorios, his Opus 2 sacred concertos and the Vespers and St Cecilia Mass – but also his unjustly neglected instrumental music, including 6 albums devoted to his keyboard works.",,,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Baroque Era,Germany,1989-2017 Brilliant Classics,2018 Brilliant Classics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several of the great Lieder singers have recorded Schubert songs with guitar (Christoph Pregardien and Peter Schreier principal among them), and to highly expressive effect. In many ways the change of instrument draws back these songs to their medieval heritage, to the Minnesanger (minstrels, or troubadours) who fulfilled courtly functions, or at a more humble level travelled from town to town, lute slung over the back, entertaining nobles and commoners alike with tales of love and war. It is this tradition that Patrizia Cigna and Adriano Sebastiani have tapped into with the first complete recording of the Lieder composed by Carl Maria von Weber for which he had a guitar in mind. In fact Weber, more than most of his native contemporaries, nurtured a great affection for the instrument while it was more celebrated abroad – notably in the Classical tradition by Mauro Giuliani, and we should not forget that the guitar was the first instrument of Hector Berlioz. Weber would accompany himself like a early-Romantic troubadour in his own songs, and he scored for the guitar in several of his stage-works such as Abu Hassan. The Op.25 Lieder bring together these two strands, written as incidental music for August von Kotzebue’s one-act play Der arme Minnesanger (The Poor Minstrel). Some of the songs here such as the Op.13 set and the Op.29 Canzonettas were written with either keyboard or guitar accompaniment in mind, for obvious, commercially attractive reasons, but the standalone Mayenblumelein was only ever intended for the guitar, as was the lovely, polyphonic Sagt, woher stammt Liebeslust which calls for two sopranos, a three-voice female choir, and a guitar accompaniment. These, like several other songs on this recording, have no rivals in the current catalogue, making this a new recording an essential acquisition for all lovers of Romantic Lieder.",,,01 Classical,Classical,,Germany,2018 Brilliant Classics,2018 Brilliant Classics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Apart from being a virtuoso flautist, Johann Joachim Quantz (1697–1773) was also a theorist, composer and flute maker of outstanding stature and acclaim. Despite his humble origins as the son of a blacksmith, he rose to great eminence in the 18th-century flute world, becoming a personal friend of Frederick the Great of Prussia and living happily at the emperor’s court in Potsdam, where for 32 years. During this period he wrote and performed over 300 works for the flute, playing them on specially devised instruments that brought out their particular melodic vein. Quantz is in many ways the ‘father of the flute’, as instrument-maker, composer and finally performer. His own music owes much of its zest and charm to contemporary Italianate examples such as Vivaldi, whom Quantz met in Venice. Almost 300 concertos survive, and over 200 sonatas: where to start with so prodigious an output? On this new recording, Stefano Bagliano has selected two concertos (in F major and G minor, nicely contrasted) and a pair of trio sonatas, in C major and again in G minor, the close relative of B flat major to which the flute is technically well suited: many sinfonias and movements of designedly pastoral character have been composed in those keys with the flute playing a starring role. Indeed, all the slow movements on this recording are distinguished by their gently flowing, pastoral character. This is the latest disc in the extensive and well-received discography of Stefano Bagliano, period-instrument flautist, recorder player and ensemble-leader, on Brilliant Classics. Previous successes include discs of Vivaldi, Telemann, C.P.E. Bach and Fiorenza and Mele. ‘A bountifully filled disc of splendid music in first-rate performances,’ remarked MusicWeb International of the Collegium Pro Musica/Bagliano album of Sammartini. ‘The Collegium Pro Musica has a fine, warm, authentic sound.’",,,01 Classical,Classical,,Germany,2018 Brilliant Classics,2018 Brilliant Classics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Under the title of ‘early variations’, Alessandro Commellato has brought together all those theme with variation sets for solo and four hands piano that were not included in the main catalogue of Beethoven's compositions. In fact not all of them are early: the imposing C minor 32 Variations WoO80 are the best-known work here, composed as late as 1806, and the sets on Rule Britannia and God save the King were written a year or two earlier, and perhaps not only for commercially expedient reasons, given Beethoven’s admiration for the British resistance to the proclamation of the French Empire. More common, however, are the variation sets where Beethoven was establishing his voice and refining his technique by exercising his imagination on melodies from popular marches and operas by Gretry, Paisiello and Mozart. The composer used these works to curry favour with patrons such as Prince Lichnowsky; even on occasion as dedicatory gifts in order to make amends for his notoriously obstreperous behaviour, such as the variations on a Dittersdorf arietta, ‘Es war einmal’ (Once upon a time) which he gave in the summer of 1792 to Eleonore von Breuning, daughter of Maria Helena, who had welcomed the young wayward artist into her home. Alessandro Commellato uses an 1823 fortepiano by Joseph Bohm, a Viennese piano-maker whose instruments were known to Beethoven, bestowing on this recording an unusual degree of authenticity. He is a specialist in historically informed performances of Viennese Classicism: previous discs for Brilliant Classics include music by Beethoven’s pupils such as the cello sonatas of Ferdinand Ries and piano concertos by Johann Nepomuk Hummel.",,,01 Classical,Classical,,Germany,2018 Brilliant Classics,2018 Brilliant Classics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Without the taste for fashionably abrupt turns of phrase and thought which distinguish CPE’s Sturm und Drang language, nonetheless WF’s music occupies that fast-evolving chronological and aesthetic space between what we now think of as the Baroque and Classical periods. Unlike his brother, Wilhelm Friedemann was a church musician in the lineage of their father. At the age of just 23 he was appointed principal organist at the church of St. Sophia in Dresden, and in 1747 became Musikdirektor and organist at the Church of Our Lady in Halle. After almost 20 years there, moved to Leipzig, then Brauschweig, followed by Gottingen and lastly Berlin, where he was offered an honorary (unpaid) post of Kapellmeister. He died in poverty in 1784, entirely forgotten by the musical community. The organ music that has survived is dwarfed by his father’s output for the instrument. There are four sets of fugues, and a collection of just seven choral preludes. In fact the chromatic richness of the fugues brings to mind the grand, tormented examples composed by Beethoven in the last years of his life. As such, they are like problems to be solved, like containers that are no longer sufficient to encompass the composer’s intrepid discourse and abundance of feelings. Even so, WF was still writing this music in the shadow of his late father: one F major fugue inevitably uses the B-A-C-H motif which crowned The Art of Fugue. Turri plays two recent Italian instruments: the organ by Francesco Zanin in the Church of Sant’Antonio Abate, Padua; and for the more intimately scaled works, an orgel-positiv (without pedals) by Luigi Patella.",,,01 Classical,Classical,,Germany,2018 Brilliant Classics,2018 Brilliant Classics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Yet this exiting new material is not without acknowledgement of the past, as some of the selected pieces pay homage to styles, musical languages and composers of yesteryear.

Apart from the renowned, late composers Ligeti and Eben, the music is by living authors from a variety of European backgrounds. Gyorgy Ligeti’s popular Musica ricercata, from early in the Hungarian composer’s career, is represented here by three of its movements, transcribed for organ by the artist, Luca Scandali, himself.

The real discovery for many listeners will be Turina’s Op.28, El Poema de una sanluqueña (Poem of a Sanlúcar Girl). This 20-minute, four-movement fantasy was written in 1923 and inspired by a cruel remark overheard by the composer: ‘Sanlúcar girls don’t marry and Sanlúcar boys marry outsiders’ – Sanlúcar being a coastal city just north of Cadiz. Turina’s idea was to immerse himself in the hopes and dreams of such a young woman. The movement titles - ‘In front of the mirror’ – ‘The Song of the Moon’ – ‘Hallucinations’ – ‘The Rosary in the Church’ – hint at the varied expressive and musical worlds, including oblique references to Andalucian folksong as well as highly impressionistic evocations that owe not a little to Ravel and Debussy. The Variaciones Clasicas of 1932 show another, more formally rigorous side to Turina’s craft as a composer, though the theme itself is no less imbued with a Romantic, yearning quality through its transformation as a Cuban folksong, a seguidilla and finally a dashing zapateado. The last two pieces of the collection appear as occasional pieces that are included in broader cycles. Euterpe is part of an ambitious work that seeks to represent the coming of the Greek muses to Spain, each of the them being represented by a different scoring: this is written in the lively tempo of a Sevillan dance. Finally, with Homenage a Navarra, Turina elegantly acknowledges the heritage of Sarasate in a short work based on his compatriot’s melodies.",,,01 Classical,Classical,,Germany,2018 Brilliant Classics,2018 Brilliant Classics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Best-known as the darling of the Parisian operetta audience, reliable facteur of hit after hit such as Orpheus in the Underworld and La vie Parisienne, would-be ‘serious’ composer who never lived to complete or see a staging of his masterpiece, Les contes d’Hoffmann, Jacques Offenbach was a composer of many parts. His practical training as a cellist of accomplishment is recognised, and his work for the instrument holds a fragile place on the fringe of its repertoire (such as the Cello Duets recorded on Brilliant Classics, 94475) but few listeners will have been aware, until now, of the composer’s work in the field of art-song. In fact Offenbach wrote songs throughout his career but most of them belong to his late teens, not long after he had moved to the French capital and become a cellist in the orchestra of the Opera-Comique, and thereafter as a touring cello virtuoso in his 20s. The selection made for this album by the Armenian mezzo-soprano Mariam Sarkissian ranges widely across genres, from the delicious Ronde tyrolienne (of 1838) to the drama-romance Jalousie of the following year. There is a classic German Lied, O bleib bei mir (1840), a more ambitious ballad Rends-moi mon âme (1843), and the recital ends with a self-contained comic duet, Meunière et fermière (Mrs Miller and Mrs Farmer), that Offenbach composed in 1846, at the age of 27.

Thus the last decades have seen the creation of outstanding works, some of which have become part of the repertoire of numerous choirs all over Europe.

Beethoven’s three Piano Trios op. 1 were the first compositions that he deemed important enough to give an opus number. They were dedicated to Prince Karl Lichnowsky, a patron of Beethoven in whose house he lived for some time. According to Beethoven’s lifelong friend Ferdinand Ries, Haydn was complimentary about the set of trios. The trios combine various elements that would have been familiar to Beethoven’s contemporaries. Less familiar, however, would be the fact that the trios contain four movements rather than the three that had been traditional in this genre. Although changes from major to minor had been common in the music of previous generations, where they would normally apply to just the last chord, Beethoven employs this technique more extensively here than was probably common at that time.

There are many distinctive characteristics of Keiser’s setting where parallels with Bach’s Passions can be drawn, and indeed it is likely that Bach learned a good deal from composers like Keiser who were applying operatic principles to religious themes. There are detailed traits which are most Bach like: a string accompanied Christus, reflective da capo arias, dramatic crowd involvement and a resourceful use of the chorale melody in several manifestations. More specifically, Keiser has a wonderfully Bachian habit of subtle harmonic coloring at well-chosen moments; some of those inimitably poignant and potent shadings in Bach’s passions are foreshadowed here. “Christian Brembeck is a sympathetic director and his young group of musicians serve him well ... those who love German baroque vocal music and/or are interested in Bach’s close contemporaries and musical heritage will not be disappointed.” (Gramophone, March 1995)",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=CHR77421,01 Classical,Classical,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Icredibly, the first performance did not take place until 1929, (a similar fate awaited the 2nd Suite, composed in 1911, and not given its first performance until 1922!). With a history dating back to 1836, the Soncino band established itself nationally in 1906 on the occasion of the Milan Exposition music competition. In 1993 under the direction of Ugo Vanoli and Giancarlo Locatelli, the band was completely refounded and since 1999 it has been a semi-professional group under the direction of maestro Luca Valenti.

Nothing new here, one might think, except that Adkins does propose a new relationship between the constituent elements. Much has been made of his saxophone sound, which does as Stuart Broomer perceptively noted in the liner notes of Adkins’ previous CD sound like a confident appropriation of many decades of saxophone language and jazz styles. Here, though, one is perhaps less immediately struck by the timbre and phrasing of the lead instrument than how it moves through the space defined by the group.

In Applebaum’s Three Unlikely Corporate Sponsorships, he uses his own voice contrapuntally, ranting ever more hilariously about the injustices of the world today. Biting socio-political commentary has rarely been more foot tapping. Applebaum reached into his home storage space and fired up eight classic analog synths from the 80s.

Why, he won’t say: just because a piece of music has no lyrics doesn’t mean it’s less personal, and this is as personal as it gets. “It’s pretty much me,” Albanese says, “translated into music.” But a clue to the composition’s significance lies in the album’s title: this rock, he says, “is also where I imagined Lord Byron writing his poem ‘The Sea’.”  The poem is notable for its juxtaposition of concepts centered around ideas of society and solitude, and for acknowledging the pleasure of pursuing routes others have not. It’s a fitting source for the album’s title: these are themes familiar to ALBANESE, who wrote the music over “a year in which a lot happened, stuff that’s difficult to explain.

The two have performed together various times over the ensuing 17 years, but Laplante never felt he was quite ready to record with Cleaver. “It got to the point where I took a multiple-year break from playing with him because I felt like I didn’t have enough to bring to the table,” says Laplante. “I needed to practice so I could have more to give to our musical relationship.” Then, in the fall of 2016, Laplante received a commission to compose a piece to be performed at Roulette in Brooklyn the following spring. “I knew that this was the perfect opportunity to return to this relationship with Gerald.” And so Laplante began composing an epic-scale work with Cleaver’s rhythmic virtuosity in mind. Inspired by the longer forms of spiritual ceremonies, A Dance That Empties is a continuous journey that unfolds over 43 minutes, with musical motifs that foreshadow, recur, and evolve.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSHrsMBxnvY&feature=youtu.be,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=NWAM093,02 Jazz,Jazz,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

More specifically, Hersch was inspired by a series of etchings and lithographs Mazur did of inmates in a Rhode Island mental asylum in the 1960's. In his musical depiction of these images, Hersch writes music that is at times aggressive and disturbing and at other times wistful, but always with the profound intensity of a deeply sensitive nature. Mazur wrote of Hersch’s music: “These compositions are filled sometimes with frightening sounds. They are unrelenting, nearly without hope… But no artwork can be without hope since it is in the very nature of creative work to be optimistic, if only in as much as we continue to work through everything but our own death.”",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=FCR199,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Contemporary Era,United States,2017 Michael Hersch,2017 Michael Hersch,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To try and put together a representative collection of the world's traditions is of course a ridiculous undertaking, and even the six full length CDs in this set barely put a dent in what is out there, let alone what this organization has collected. But if you want a concise reference guide to many of the most important and amazing musical entities on the planet, you can't do much better than this. The set is divided into regional collections: South Asia, Southeast Asia, East Asia, North and West Africa, Africa (western and central), and Europe…There are the old styles: solo pipa in China, singers and dancers in Gambia, village gamelan in Bali, and tavern singers in Greece. Each is excellently recorded on location--rarely in the studio--and never produced, staged, or overdubbed. The booklets that come with each CD are comprehensive, providing both regional history and reasonable details on the individual artists and pieces presented. Ocora has released hundreds of records over the years, and each has an important place in any library, but this compendium is certainly a vital starting point.”",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=C%20560277-82,30 World/Int'l.,World,,,2017 Radio France,2017 Radio France,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was Hermann Levi and Richard Strauss who recreated the original work for Munich with through-composed recitatives instead of spoken dialogues. Amazingly, it took this Munich production of the 1970s to bring Mozart’s absolute masterpiece to life in its original language; yet anything else – from a great master of musically subtle, rapid-reaction word-play – is sheer sacrilege! In any case, the acoustic account captures an almost unbearably intense moment in the history of music theatre. The music director of those days, true to local tradition and to his own history, once again shows himself to be not only a consummate Wagner and Strauss conductor but also, as in the previously released “Don Giovanni” from that era, a hugely skilled interpreter of Mozart. The piece’s ensemble qualities, lifting it from the chasms of deep disgrace to a pinnacle of Mozart’s operatic writing, are brought out with breathtaking drama and vivid versatility, due not least to the cumulatively sensational qualities of the various protagonists.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=ORF-C918182I,01 Classical,Classical,,Austria,2018 ORFEO International Music GmbH,2018 ORFEO International Music GmbH,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Upon closer listening, one quickly becomes aware of the many byways and backroads of the genre, in addition to the principal trends, and one composer who trod his own path decisively, with great success, is Gottfried von Einem. Since his breakthrough with the premiere of his opera Dantons Tod (the death of Danton) at the Salzburg Festival in 1947, through to the composer’s death in 1996, many of his works have been performed on the international music stage, as witness recordings featuring the likes of Bohm, Karajan and George Szell on this label. However, everyone knows that for a composer to continue to develop his artistic skills he needs more than glittering premieres, and so the Orfeo label is delighted to mark the 100th birthday of the composer born in 1918 by releasing, alongside other new recordings of his works from its catalogue, a retrospective of von Einem’s work featuring the very best performers of today. The earliest work on this new release is the choral work with orchestra Stundenlied, which originates from a highly interesting cultural and historical source: a collaboration with the playwright Bertolt Brecht who from 1949 lived in the German Democratic Republic. The story of Christ’s passion is witnessed and presented in a popular, naive way as a dreadful event and brilliantly depicted by von Einem using simple and stringent compositional means to produce a work that is haunting and authoritative, performed here by the Singverein and Philharmonic Orchestra of Vienna under Franz Welser-Most.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=ORF-C929181A,01 Classical,Classical,,Austria,2018 ORFEO International Music GmbH,2018 ORFEO International Music GmbH,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The writing is very much that of his time, focusing on the practice of full belcanto in all his glory. Our selection, encompassing the period from 1729 to 1735, tries to display not only Giacomelli’s “lively imagination”, but also the wide spectrum of affetti from which the opera seria of the time usually profited.

Once described by the Boston Globe as a “20th-century Brahms”, Hindemith wrote music that is Modernist in its rhythmic audacity and colourful orchestration, but simultaneously inspired by Classical forms and styles. The WDR Symphony Orchestra and conductor Marek Janowski provide a fascinating interpretation of three orchestral works that display an irrepressible, almost wild passion for music-making that is omnipresent throughout Hindemith’s oeuvre. In the Concert Music for Strings and Brass, also known as “Boston Symphony,” Hindemith invigorates the century-old concertato style of competing instrument groups in twentieth-century fashion by utilizing unusual ensemble combinations. He extracted the Nobilissima Visione suite from an eponymous “dance legend” on Saint Francis’s vision of the three allegories of poverty, chastity, and obedience. The piece represents the violent battle in which Francis is wounded, but most of the music is serene, focusing on the noblest vision that the wounded Francis subsequently experiences. The Symphonic Metamorphosis of Themes by Carl Maria von Weber were also conceived as a ballet, but eventually materialized as a concert piece. Hindemith based the work on a collection of melodies that Carl Maria von Weber once wrote for a theatre performance of Friedrich Schiller’s Turandot. Weber’s rather simple chinoiserie dating from 1809 is driven forward relentlessly by Hindemith’s rhythms and jazzy harmonies. The piece epitomizes Hindemith’s capacity to reconcile the old and new in a highly personal musical language.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=PTC5186672,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Oratorio,Germany,2017 WDR Koln,2018 PENTATONE Music B.V.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This certainly applies to Mahler’s Fourth Symphony: a work that stands at the crossroads between the largely “Romantic” early symphonies nos. 1–3 and the much more “Modernist” middle-period symphonies nos. 5–7. It is also a fundamentally ambivalent piece: its joyous and accessible surface hides a surprising degree of complexity and even contrariness. While still employing many of the tropes of the traditional nineteenth-century symphony, Mahler at the same time undermines those tropes and distances himself from the symphonic tradition he inherited. The entire symphony works towards the pastoral folksong “Das himmlische Leben” in the fourth movement, sung here by the outstanding Swedish soprano Miah Persson. The Piano Quartet is Mahler’s only surviving chamber music composition, and the movement represented on this album is the only one he completed. Mahler wrote the piece most likely in 1876 or 1877.

The Second Symphony boasts a language that is utterly original, the entirety of its four-movement arc spun out from the long-breathed noble theme at its opening. So enamoured of the Second was Boult he later chose it as one of his Desert Island Discs when he appeared on the iconic BBC Radio 4 programme.

Yet hunting music, for a variety of ensembles (including the wind Harmonie), was also played at feasts and other social events. Hunting-themed pieces - cassations, serenades, partitas (many of them termed caccia or la chasse) - indicated their connection with hunting by the selection of instruments, the typical harmonies and melodies, as well as by featuring onomatopoeic effects, such as the sounds of animals and birds, and sonic renditions of buoyant merry-making in the wake of the hunting expedition.

But the heart of his music lies in a series of eighteen symphonies, which have a strong narrative elemtn, some reflecting Jewish themes, others inspired by Karelia and Finland. Symphony No. 17, Joy of Life, has an autobiographical programme charting, in abstract terms, Bruk’s surmounting of the obstacles fate put in his path. Symphony No. 18 takes as its starting point a Latvian-Jewish folksong: it is premised on the deportation of his grandparents from their Latvian home, in an anti-Semitic campaign by Tsarist Russia that Bruk sees as a kind of prologue to the Holocaust. Gertruda Jerjomenko is a Latvian pianist and harpsichordist. She made her solo debut in a CPE Bach concerto with the Baroque orchestra Collegium Musicum Riga under the guidance of Maris Kupcs and has since appeared at concerts and festivals as a soloist, chamber and orchestra music, in Latvia and abroad.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=TOCC0455,01 Classical,Classical,,,Toccata Classics,Toccata Classics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As Timothy Roberts writes in his introduction to this first album of Jackson’s music, ‘his songs are rooted in English traditions, and if his harmonies rarely move beyond those of Corelli and Handel, Jackson’s emphasis on sensibility also brings hints of early Romanticism.’ One contemporary observed that ‘His melodies were pure and natural,’ resulting in music that is both elegant and charming. This recording brings two esteemed early music stars into the toccata Classics catalogue: Dame Emma Kirkby and Charles Daniels. Dame Emma Kirkby’s voice and style are recognized worldwide. Awarded a DBE in 2008 and in 2011 the Queen’s Medal for Music, she is grateful for these responses to the world of early music. Charles Daniels is recognized as one of the world’s leading performers of Baroque music. He has made over 90 recordings, and is based primarily in Bunyola.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=TOCC0477,01 Classical,Classical,,,Toccata Classics,Toccata Classics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rodney Newton (b. 1945) earned his living as an orchestral timpanist and percussionist, becoming known primarily for his works for brass bands. Until now his substantial output for orchestra has remained completely unknown. This first recording of two early symphonies reveals a composer with a strong sense of melody, drama, and color, in the tradition of such earlier British symphonists as Vaughan Williams and Arnold. The tone poem Distant Nebulae, inspired by Charles Ives’ The Unanswered Question, reflects the vastness of the heavens in music of understated beauty and elegance.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=TOCC0459,01 Classical,Classical,,,Toccata Classics,Toccata Classics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
