This program demonstrates the music of English composers of the era. The countertenor Benno Schachtner is widely regarded as one of the most promising singers in his field. With a special focus on music of the German Baroque period, he is much in demand as a soloist with some of the best ensembles committed to historic performance practice. Conductors such as René Jacobs or Christoph Spering regularly enjoy working with him. For this English program of songs by Dowland, Purcell, Johnson and Blow, Schachtner teams up with a small instrumental ensemble which provides an exquisite instrumental background to the rising star’s fine singing."

He’s been keeping good company too. Aligning with other internationally-renowned, kindred spirits working at the borderline between jazz, improv and classical music, Neset released Lion in 2014, originally a ‘live’ commission in collaboration with the celebrated young Trondheim Jazz Orchestra, and collected a Norwegian Grammy award (Spellemannprisen). Last year he released Snowmelt, a project with the 19-piece London Sinfonietta, another highly esteemed European orchestra at the cutting edge of 21st century genre-bending new music. In 2015 his quintet album Pinball received an unusual five-star rating from The Guardian writer John Fordham who described Neset as, “one of the hottest European jazz talents of recent years.” As a saxophonist, Neset has been instrumental in reinvigorating the post-70s fusion ‘big tenor’ tradition of Michael Brecker, Chris Potter and Jan Garbarek, contrasting his dazzlingly ferocious technique with a soulful spontaneity. But it has been difficult to separate Marius Neset the saxophonist Marius Neset from the composer. He’s been hailed as one of the most exciting and ambitious composers of the younger generation of innovators on the European jazz scene today. On the new release Circle of Chimes, he again takes a spectacular leap forward in redefining the role of composition in the contemporary jazz and improvising world. “This album is more personal to me than any other album I have made,” he says. “A lot of things were changing in my life and that was inspiration for the ideas on the album. It’s the darkest, most melancholic album I have made so far, even if it has lots of brighter moments on it as well.”"

For twenty years, the most successful of these, “It’s Snowing On My Piano”, has been treasured as a haven of wintry stillness and contemplation. It is a classic album. Listeners all over Europe have responded to it by giving it a permanent place in their lives. So now Bugge Wesseltoft and producer Siggi Loch have returned to the original concept of “Snowing” in “Everybody Loves Angels”. The title is a metaphor for the kind of weightless ease which the music conveys; and this time it's not just for winter... The success story started in 1997. Bugge Wesseltoft had just released the album “New Conception Of Jazz” on his own newly-founded label Jazzland. That album broke new ground, combining electronic sounds and grooves with his unmistakeably limpid, transparent piano playing, and the result was a timeless work of art. It left an indelible mark on subsequent generations of pianists, and established him as one of the most important innovators in jazz. ACT label boss Siggi Loch had been following Wesseltoft with interest for quite some time, and made him an offer: to bring a very different side of his musicianship to the fore, and to record a completely acoustic solo piano set “with Christmas in mind” for the fledgling ACT label. Wesseltoft is vehemently opposed the overcommercilisation of Christmas, and yet he did find himself attracted to the idea of recording music which would restore quietness to times in which everything is getting inexorably louder. So Bugge Wesseltoft and Siggi Loch met up at Oslo's Rainbow studio. With the pianist’s little daughter Maren perched on his lap, Wesseltoft started to improvise on Christmas songs and folk melodies. That first solo piano recording was to be the most successful – it achieved the highest sales in the history of ACT. As the popular German newspaper WAZ wrote at the time: “In its almost unworldly beauty, It's Snowing On My Piano is the greatest Christmas CD that jazz has ever produced.”"

I was returning to New York after touring with my quartet. My idea: To use three quartets to create a conversation between the world of contemporary classical composition and that of modern jazz composition and improvisation. Autumn would be my theme. Carrying out my plan, I first composed twelve pieces for my quartet and recorded them in Copenhagen. Each piece begins with a different note, generating a twelve-tone row I used in various parts of the compositions. Later, in New York, building on the fluid performances and improvisations in those recordings, I composed, conducted and recorded pieces for classical string and woodwind quartets to be superimposed on the jazz performances. The first piece is for solo guitar. Each subsequent piece adds one instrument, culminating in a finale (for twelve musicians) in which the twelve-tone row structures the entire composition. Among other compositional techniques I employed were aleatoricism, minimalism and serialized rhythms, pitches and dynamics. Always I focused on the beautiful melody and harmony suggested to me by autumn’s permutations. This musical journey begins with the shifting light of early autumn and continues with a tranquil stroll at dusk. The season’s tiniest composers appear after dark. The mystery of the animal kingdom’s autumn journey coincides with the season’s changing leaves. Birds call and fly in grand formation through sunlight, clouds, rain and blustery winds. The autumn wind carries sounds from near and far. Moonbeams penetrate the deep forest. Sunrise reveals farm fields covered with snow. Chimney smoke rises against the blue sky in bright sunlight. With night, stars sparkle and flare. The aurora borealis paints the sky. The journey ends in quiet reflection."""

I decided to become a pianist and- possibly- a composer, too.” Palmgren’s pianist and composer careers were closely interwoven.

The album came together at a recording session that took place in Havana, Cuba in the month of January in 2017. The release presents a variety of collaborations between American, or American-based, composers and Cuban instrumentalists, arrangers, singers, and composers. Some of these connections are relatively straightforward, while others are more nuanced and personal; yet, they all enrich the compositions on CHEVERE with the energy unique to the interaction of two powerful musical traditions. Arthur Gottschalk’s Imagenes de Cuba and John A. Carollo’s In Your Hour of Need represent the album’s most nuanced and personal connections to Cuba. Gottschalk’s work draws on his many trips to Cuba, referencing various elements of modern Cuban culture as observed in his travels. Carollo’s piece, on the other hand, gains its Cuban character directly from the input of CHEVERE’s producer in Havana, Dayron Ortega, who arranged this work for instrumental ensemble. Originally a piano etude, Carollo and Ortega collaboratively transform In Your Hour of Need into a brilliant and truly fascinating amalgam of Euro-American musical ideas and Cuban instrumentation and orchestration. Meira Warshauer’s plaintive choral works Oseh Shalom and Akhat Sha’alti represent the classic form of cultural exchange wherein Warshauer’s voice as a Jewish-American composer is brought to life by the renowned Cuban vocal ensemble Schola Coralina."

Night is a common theme of Robert Schumann’s life and indeed his works. Bo Wiget has compiled a cycle from the composer’s hundreds of songs, leading us from dusk through the night up until the morning. The songs, most of which were originally composed for voice and piano, are given a nocturnal touch through the wealth of color imparted by the two cellos. The unique arrangements for the Tolkar cello duo and Andrea Chudak broaden the spectrum: now close to the original, now transporting the listener into unfamiliar terrain through which Schumann’s melodies wander like ghostly revenants. Here and there, the soprano receives vocal backup from singing cellist. Now and then, the soprano takes up a cello, adding to the resonant backdrop of cello sounds. The three musicians provide a modern perspective of Schumann’s musical gems, giving insight into a time when nights were still dark, dreams and reality were interlaced by darkness and the night opened up unfamiliar dimensions."

The very origin of Indian classical music is in the praise of the Supreme Power of the Almighty. Thus, Indian classical music has a spiritual value, rather than an entertainment value. A performance is almost like a symphony being played, with the difference that the Indian “symphony” is not written. The artist creates it during the course of his recital, always keeping within the framework of the raga. The music is essentially an extension of a prayer but the artist is morally bound to offer his music as a gift of peace and joy to all who hear the music. The insight of the musician is thus conveyed to the listeners. On this album Rash Behari Datta plays the raga “Koushiki.” On the sitar this raga is very close to the popular raga “Kounsi-Kanhra.” During the Mughal period of India many new ragas were created and many new combinations were tried. Out of these the Kanhras type of raga became very popular. The Kounsi-Kanhra is also a combination of two ragas: the Malkouns and the Kanhra."

This was the time and place in which the largest amount of impressive music with oboe and bassoon as soloists in history was written. German composers such as Heinichen, Zelenka (to be heard by Zefiro on ARCANA A 394), Fasch and Quantz wrote these pieces in the Italian style, with the typical alternation between singing adagios and brilliant allegros. Telemann composed a sonata with ornamentation and affects inspired by the French style. Lotti, who resided in Dresden between 1717 and 1719, also noticed the outstanding skills of the court’s wind players and wrote his only solo pieces for these instruments there. Vivaldi met Richter during the latter’s visit to Venice in 1716, when he accompanied the Elector to the city, and he too dedicated some remarkable oboe and bassoon solos to the German musician."

A controversial biography, many aspects of which have not yet been elucidated, and a musical output of excellent quality constitute the appeal of this composer born in Chioggia, who is still overshadowed today by his famous successors. Yet Giovanni Croce proves to be an extraordinary figure, halfway between the conservative Venetian school of Gioseffo Zarlino and the modernism of Claudio Monteverdi. He makes masterly use of double chorus and of such special devices as echo effects, while maintaining a fine transparency in his counterpoint that links him with classical polyphony. Two exceptional young Swiss ensembles, the vocal group Voces Suaves (which has won several prizes for its first two recordings) and the instrumental ensemble Concerto Scirocco, combine here in the magnificent surroundings of the palatine basilica of Santa Barbara in Mantua, where they have the advantage of the outstanding Antegnati organ built in 1565, to honour Giovanni Croce and his contemporaries and introduce us to other aspects of the glorious musical activity at St Mark’s."

Thanks to studying Beethoven so thoroughly, the ensemble'sbroad repertoire has gained a new level of intensity and their playing culturehas been honed even further, both in terms of detailed expression and ofoverarching gestures and contours. The final volume of the edition opens withthe third of the Op. 18 Quartets with which Beethoven introduced himself as acomposer in 1800 - six quartets which indeed all tell their own ""story"". Fromthe tentative beginning, cautiously drawing the listener in,through to the tempestuous concluding tarantella, every bar of the Quartet in Dmajor is replete and carefully considered. Beethoven's debut quartet is contrastedwith the so-called ""Harp Quartet"" Op. 74, featuring yet another formalsolution. A cunningly conceived first movement with prominent plucked ""harpnotes"" is answered by the finale, where Beethoven reuses a (discarded) numberfrom his incidental music to Goethe's freedom drama Egmont as a theme and variations - a clear indication of the factthat the composer, in 1809, at the time of the Napoleonic Wars, lived throughpolitically precarious times."

The result is actually a new synthesis, equivalent to what we conventionally call musca mundane, “universal music.” With that term we certainly do not mean World Music- which has resulted from cultural globalization- since Sviridov, quite to the contrary, was a down to earth authentic Russian composer.

Lieder, as the lyrical genre per se, marked out the territory in which musicians could express the most profound emotions. The best composers therefore increasingly chose to through-compose their songs- a logical step, thanks to which they were able to closely follow the content and the speech of the poems they were setting to music. Beethoven already took that very step in his earliest Lieder. The emotional value of a song such as Adelaide op. 46 even managed to convince a late-19th century Vienna music critic otherwise well known for his harshness-Eduard Hanslick, who wrote in 1886: “No depiction of a youth’s enthusiastic love could be more faithful and exemplary than this Adelaide by Beethoven. What sweet, secret bliss shivers in every note of this golden melody!...” Beethoven’s contributions can be described as new arrangements and harmonizations of pre-existing melodies.

The 20th century produced a number for works for oboe and piano in which the woodwind instrument adopts an almost “furious” character, one that is not typically heard in most orchestral repertoire. On this new release, the artists would like to demonstrate the oboe’s variety of tone color and versatility. The main idea is centered on the oboe as a “singing voice” with its tremendous ability to phrase long cantilenas: hence, this program is closely associated with the human voice."

The idea that inspired it was twofold: on the one hand, it is made up of variation cycles (with the exception of the Rondo brillante on a theme from Bellini’s opera ‘I Capuletti ed I Montecchi’). On the other hand, the programme’s chronological order not only traces the fascinating evolution of Glinka’s composition technique, but also the manner in which his successors used what he had invented: the “Glinka-type variation” where the theme and/or structure are usually not modified, but the accompaniment is subjected to a great variety of transformations. Glinka was held in high regard as the “father of Russian music.” Many Russian composers made his variation technique their own and developed it further- for example, Tchaikovsky in the Finale of his 4th Symphony. I therefore decided to include two further works that refer to Glinka: the Paraphrase on Glinka’s Song ‘The Lark’ by Mily Balakirev, and Variations on a Theme by Glinka by Anatoly Lyadov.”"

Even as a schoolgirl learning the piano, she admired the nineteenth-century artist’s apparent dexterity; later on, she read biographies, diaries and the entire correspondence – in short, everything pertaining to Clara Schumann. Ragna Schirmer not only greatly admires the composer’s works; she is fascinated by Clara’s character and her diverse roles as a pianist, mother and emancipated artist. A few years ago she discovered an old salon grand piano built by Bluthner and dating back to 1856, which she had restored at great expense. This allowed her to approach Clara Schumann’s art of playing more authentically than before; indeed, she still gives recitals on the instrument. During her years of study she wrote essays about Clara and to this day she maintains frequent contact with musicologists and historians. If there is a recognised expert on Clara Schumann who is simultaneously one of Germany’s most successful pianists of today, then it is Ragna Schirmer. This recording marks the fulfilment of a long-held wish by Ragna Schirmer: to suitably mark the 200th birthday of Clara Schumann, on September 13, 2019. That wish has grown into a large-scale long-term project, following on from her album “Liebe in Variationen” released in 2015, which looked at the musical messages of affection and love between Robert and Clara Schumann and their friend Johannes Brahms. The present recording combines Clara Schumann’s Piano Concerto in A minor op. 7 with the Fourth Piano Concerto in G major by Ludwig van Beethoven, which Clara Schumann played in more than 50 concerts and for which she wrote her own cadenzas. To make this live recording, Ragna Schirmer invited the conductor Ariane Matiakh to the place she has chosen to live, Halle an der Saale."

In his new album “Frei aber einsam” – free but lonely – pianist Matthias Kirschnereit brings Brahms’s timeless music into the present day. What can we learn from his works? “Certainly not that we should renounce love and all live the ascetic life”, says Kirschnereit. “But perhaps that we need to focus, take time out and ask ourselves where we want to go. And we can best do that in a state of solitude in the most positive sense of the word. Then we may be able to catch flashes from our own personal chasms. They can sound so sweet! Brahms cultivates dark melancholy, after all, not kitsch.” F.A.E. is thus a reference for the pianist to a captivating and at the same time puzzling composer, coupled with a thought of Johannes Brahms the man, of his life’s motto. In the two “monoliths” – the F minor Sonata and the F minor Quintet – this motto takes musical form. The Scherzo from the eponymous Sonata for piano and violin was Brahms’s first musical involvement with this subject. The close link between Brahms’s artistic achievement and his philosophy of life is well documented. “He made it clear to his friends time and again that he wished to live wholly for music, wholly for his compositions. He was concerned that bourgeois obligations, which he viewed as fetters, would harm his work”, the pianist says. Matthias Kirschnereit is currently one of the most exciting and successful German pianists of his generation. He has made his name at Berlin Classics with Romantic repertoire and now, following his recordings of works by Schumann and Schubert and his ambitious “Songs without Words” CD set (Mendelssohn/Hensel), he presents his new album. Romantic to the depths of its musical being, this recording wonderfully brings alive the (musical) motto that governed the life of Johannes Brahms. Added interest is won from the chamber-music coupling and his collaboration with the Amaryllis Quartett and violinist Lena Neudauer."

Brahms brought the sonata with him when he went to Dusseldorf in October 1853 in order to meet Robert and Clara Schumann – an encounter which has gone down in music history. It was possibly the C major sonata, with its opening reminiscent of Beethoven’s Hammerklavier Sonata, which caused Schumann to liken Brahms to ‘a young eagle’ and a ‘true apostle’. But very soon after the meeting, Schumann’s mental health began to decline, to the point of him attempting suicide in February 1854. Composed in the same year, Brahms’s Op. 9 Schumann Variations were closely connected with these events and with Robert and Clara. Brahms chose a theme – from Schumann’s collection Bunte Blätter – which Clara herself had composed a set of variations on, and dedicated it to her. Schumann died, hospitalized, in 1856, but Clara and Brahms remained intimate friends. Some forty years later, Clara was one of the first persons to whom Brahms showed the newly composed set of Fantasies, Op. 116 – ‘wonderfully original’ was her reaction, and later performers and listeners have agreed with her. Jonathan Plowright has been described as ‘a true and moving poet of the keyboard’ by Gramophone magazine and his Brahms cycle has received critical acclaim, with instalments being singled out in Gramophone (Editor’s Choice), BBC Music Magazine (Instrumental Choice of the Month) and on ClassicsToday.com (‘10/10’)."

Meanwhile, Poltera has chosen to equip his 1711 Stradivarius cello with gut strings, and together the two musicians and their instruments create a sound which is both flexible, transparent and vigorous – ideal for Mendelssohn’s scores.

Some hundred years later, in 1715, it was converted to suit the musical tastes and demands of the baroque period. For this disc, Jakob Lindberg has chosen works that could have formed part of the repertory of the presumably German owner of the instrument at around the time of its final conversion. For German lutenists from about the middle of the seventeenth century, it was France that provided the aesthetic and musical model, and towards the end of the century, when the lute rather suddenly and inexplicably dropped out of fashion in Paris certain French luthistes travelled abroad and met with great success in German-speaking lands. With them, they took their music and special traditions of lute-playing, evidence of which can be seen in the music of several of the German composers included here. The release closes with a suite of pieces by Silvius Leopold Weiss, the most famous lutenist of the baroque era. Weiss, Lindberg and the Rauwolf lute first crossed paths in 2006 on a highly acclaimed all-Weiss disc (BIS-1524): ‘Too good to be true’ was the verdict in International Record Review while the reviewer in Goldberg Magazine wrote ‘As an evocation of the lute's magical qualities, this deserves to achieve cult status.’"

His highly idiosyncratic figure as both man and musician endeared him to the poets of his time, who were able to understand him, but made him unpopular with contemporary composers, who were too different from him. He was a small man, with genteel and affected mannerisms. He studied piano at the Moscow Conservatory and graduated in 1892 with perfect marks and a medal for merit. He was often struck by nervous fits and tormented by dark thoughts. He was a strange man, who walked with an unusual skip. His early musical production reflects his great skill as a pianist (which was universally acknowledged.) His writing builds on the tradition of Chopin and Liszt. In Scriabin’s vision there is a creator Spirit that permeates matter with light and the matter brought to life becomes “waves” (A in Russian, a word that evokes a cadenced flow). Sound, which exists because it propogates through spherical waves, and color, both constituitive elements of matter, are defined by their vibrations.

Much has changed since that time and the contrabass bassoon had certainly come of age by the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when it was used in such major works as Don Carlos by Verdi (1867), The Sorcerer’s Apprentice by Dukas (1897), Salome by Strauss (1905), and others. The seven works on the present recording are a splendid demonstration of how greatly the 20th century expanded the resources of the contrabass bassoon.

To mark the occasion of the upcoming Rossini year of 2018, she and the Munchner Rundfunkorchester, conducted by Marco Armiliato, have recorded an album of highly dramatic opera arias that is now being released by BR-KLASSIK. The album ""Amor fatale"" offers the opportunity to reacquaint oneself with the great soprano arias from Rossini's less well-known but musically convincing tragic operas, in a fine interpretation.The concept album entitled ""Amor fatal"" focuses on powerful female roles from the operas Otello, Armida, La donna del lago (The Lady of the Lake), Maometto II, Semiramide (Semiramis), Moïse et Pharaon (Moses and Pharaoh) and Guillaume Tell (William Tell). The women are obliged to choose between love and duty, and frequently have to subordinate their personal fate to that of their family, nation or homeland.The Latvian soprano has quite some experience with roles in Rossini, above all from his great tragic operas: the role of Anna Erisso from Maometto II, which she performed in 2008 at the Rossini Opera Festival in Pesaro, the composer’s birthplace, marked the very start of her career. She went on to attract international attention in 2009 when she debuted at the Salzburg Festival, as Anaï in Moïse et Pharaon. For her album she has worked through Rossini's original handwritten manuscripts and included this in her performance; she also developed her own coloratura, which not only suits her voice both musically and technically, but also best corresponds to the specific stage events and emotions encountered in her respective operatic roles."

Strongly influenced by the art of Johann Sebastian Bach, which he had encountered in the Berlin Singakademie under his teacher Carl Friedrich Zelter, the young composer wrote a series of eight chorale cantatas, including ""Verleih uns Frieden gnädiglich"" (“Give us Thy blessed peace”, 1831) - a short prayer for choir and orchestra set to words by Martin Luther. Mendelssohn's five wide-ranging and large-scale psalm settings became even more famous, and three of them can be heard here. The first piece in the group is the multi-part setting of Psalm 115 ""Non nobis Domine"" (“Not unto us, O Lord”) for soloists, choir and orchestra, op. 31 (1829/30), which was probably begun during the composer’s first stay in England and reveals his fascination for Händel's music. Mendelssohn himself considered “Wie der Hirsch schreit” (""As pants the hart""), a multi-part, cantata-like setting of Psalm 42 for soprano, choir and orchestra, op. 42 (1837/38), to be the best work of this group. Also highly praised by Robert Schumann, it remains one of the composer’s most famous choral works to this day. For the newly-formed Berlin Cathedral Choir, he also wrote a setting of Psalm 98 ""Singet dem Herren ein neues Lied” (“Sing to the Lord a new-made song”) for soloists, choir and orchestra, op. 91, and in response to requests from London he composed ""Hear my Prayer"", a “hymn” based on Psalm 55 for soprano, choir and organ, which he later orchestrated.

The recorded literature thus reflects the very latest status of the compositional repertoire for precisely these performance combinations. In the ARD International Music Competition, a contemporary work is always obligatory; it has to be specially created for the competition by renowned composers, and undergoes several different interpretations (rather like a ‘multiple premiere’) during the course of the competition - an invaluable opportunity for listeners to experience the most recent works in interpretations that often differ greatly. Since it is not always the first-prize winners who offer the “best interpretation of the commissioned work"", a special prize is conferred for particularly excellent interpretations. It is also remarkable that the various award winners have gone through an astonishing development, and are now extremely successful on the international concert stage. The highly varied programme on this album includes compositions by Rodion Shchedrin, Nikolaus Brass, Wolfgang Rihm, Esa-Pekka Salonen, Erkki-Sven Tuur, David Sawer and Johannes Maria Staud in prizewinning interpretations by Korbinian Altenberger (violin), Antoine Tamestit (viola), Tristan Cornut (violoncello), the Apollon Musagète Quartet, the Armida Quartet, the Quartet Amabile and the Quatuor Ébène."

In 1755, he was also appointed organist at Notre-Dame Cathedral. The music for which he is now best known is the Nouveau Livre de noëls, a collection of variations on traditional French Christmas songs. The noël has a distinguished lineage in French musical history, as the nearest equivalent to the English carol, an expression of joy at Christmas-time. Thus they are popular songs, of simple form, memorable melody and often pastoral character, telling the story not only of the birth of Christ but of the shepherds who rush to see the infant in the manger in Bethlehem. With the French Revolution the genre fell from favor but was revived in Paris in the late 19th century, with examples by Franck, Guilmant and Tournemire. The noels of Daquin remain pre-eminent, however, for their charm and vivacity. Adriano Falcioni has made several recordings for Brilliant Classics which have been warmly welcomed by the international press: among them substantial or complete collections of organ music by Couperin, Franck and Durufle.

In the years in which Giovanni was active, the churches of Venice bore witness to the emancipation of instrumental music from vocal music. At St Mark’s, music for the organ appeared alongside liturgical choral music, independent from the latter and comprising motets and instrumental pieces. Indeed, in Gabrieli’s Venice a distinction was being made between virtuoso organ soloists and choral accompanists. His works for keyboard, whilst relatively scarce in his catalogue, embrace all of the main genres in fashion between the late 16th and early 18th centuries. This recording presents the entire body of work, and was put together predominantly on the basis of the manuscripts held by the Foà and Giordano collections in Turin.

Most of his considerable output was, naturally, sacred in form and purpose: not only motets and mass settings but symphonic oratorios and even a sacred opera based on the life of the painter Brunelleschi. He was appointed a cardinal in 2010 and died in 2013. Very little of his music has been recorded. Here, however, is a new studio recording of his chamber music, made in the Pontifical Institute for Sacred Music in Rome. The genre of Prelude, Intermezzo and Fugue implies a keyboard work of the type written by Bach or Franck; here, however, are two examples scored for violin/cello duet and for string trio, both demonstrating Bartolucci’s considerable mastery of counterpoint. They are joined by a Piano Trio with a lovely second-movement Canzone, and a Violin Sonata of engaging richness: there are moments of great passion in the first movement, of elegiac delicacy in the slow movement, grotesque elements in the third movement, and a luminous fluidity reminiscent of Mozart in the finale."

A couple have been made by native ensembles from the composer’s Czech homeland but also a couple more by central-European ensembles such as the Stamitz Quartet, who since their foundation in 1985 have been known as leading interpreters of Czech repertoire. The approach of the Stamitz Quartet is quite different from either the Panocha or Prague ensembles, noted David Hurwitz in Classics Today: ‘more relaxed, less rhythmically charged, and gracious in an old-world sort of way… The group also gives unusual stature to the somewhat formally scattered early works, particularly the monstrous Third Quartet, which at 72 minutes has to be just about the all-time longest string quartet that ostensibly observes the rules of classical form.’ Taken as a whole, the quartets chart the evolution of Dvorák’s style, from his interest in Wagnerian music in the years prior to 1870 – in the String Quartet in D major – to the folk-infused works of his later life, such as the String Quartet in G major Op.106, and show the influence of his time in the United States, with the String Quartet in F Op.96 'American'.

Though his music has been associated with the ‘Third Stream’ that brings together jazz and classical idioms, Kapustin rejects the term for himself: ‘the classical part is more important. The jazz style is there to give color – I don’t like jazz ‘forms’… which is why I've adopted those from classical music.’ All the same, there is an unmistakably bluesy, relaxed quality to the Second Cello Sonata from 1998. Kapustin has composed more for the cello than any other instrument, and the instrument’s natural affinity with both lyricism and melancholy make a good fit for his own style. Towards the end of the finale there is a momentary sense of dislocation as the cello launches into the Prelude from Bach’s First Cello Suite before the two instruments drag the movement back into the modern world. The First Sonata from seven years earlier is briefer and spikier, less expressively effusive but at the same time written more within the cello-sonata tradition from Brahms to Adès, with a central Sarabande and driving Scherzo.

For decades, Martinu had shied away from composing a symphony. The first one was finally to be written in the USA in 1942, followed by another one every year until 1946 (the sixth was only added to the work catalogue in 1953). For this reason, there is sometimes talk of the ‘American’ symphonies. The symphonies do mirror the events of the time, but at the same time long passages must be regarded as absolute music.

Beauty is another common feature, which they display in their own way. And in the circle of fifths these pieces are very close to one another. Personal and familial kinships become apparent with the name of Bach.

I grew up knowing the sonatas by Brahms as so many cellists do- the E minor in particular being a piece I’ve played since I was 12… so to me, playing these works feels like coming home.” The programme also includes transcriptions of Brahms’ Four Serious Songs which LaFollette describes as growing to love ‘by osmosis’ through hearing them at home, performed by his parents. He describes this project as inspired by “Home and family. Two very important facets of both my existence as a human being and as an artist.” LaFollette has a rich and varied career as an international soloist and chamber musician. After being launched by YCAT he went on to win first prize at The Arts Club’s and Decca Records’ inaugural Classical Music Award. In 2011 he was appointed Principal Cello Teacher at the distinguished Yehudi Menuhin School."

This fifth one sumptuously highlights the Polish influences in Chopin’s music, offering gems from among the mazurkas and polonaises. Relatively brief in duration and simple in structure, the mazurkas reveal other aspect of Chopin’s music: quirky melodies, strangely chromatic harmonies, oddly accented rhythms, irregular phrase lengths, and wildly contrasting keyboard textures. They represent a fascinating part of Chopin’s output, for audiences and pianists alike. The vigour of the polonaises featured here, including the first two to be published, confirms Chopin as a radical, yet idiomatic transformer of the genre. The Allegro de concert, which Chopin was said to have kept for his projected return to ‘a free Warsaw’, is another link to his beloved country."

The operetta Der Vetter aus Dingsda (1921) became his most famous work. Since he had not exactly experienced positive things in the United States, he evidently was not so eager to go into exile. As a result, during the Nazi era he became known as the ""Master of the German Operetta,"" even though he hardly made concessions to the regime and repeatedly ran into trouble because he refused to separate from his ""half-Jewish"" wife Katarina. Along with his operettas, Kunneke regularly composed »serious works« for the concert hall that were almost completely neglected – wrongly so. For example, his Piano Concerto is a work very much displaying higher aspirations and qualifying as top-quality musical entertainment. His concerto is certainly the most original and spirited example of a genre of works engaging in dialogue with classicism and swing in the 1920s and including contributions by Gershwin and Ravel. The ""game of musical catch"" played by the orchestra and piano at the beginning of the first movement is simply astonishing. In the Gypsy Melodies and Serenade for Orchestra, pieces with which Kunneke demonstrated his early mastery around 1907, he styled himself as a very creative heir to Brahms and the late romanticist Max Reger, who had taught him the craft of composition."

During the second half of the eighteenth century, under Padre Giovanni Battista Martini, the Accademia would go on to experience its most glorious phase. From the very beginning this new institution could count on the participation of some prominent musicians active in Modena and Bologna. They included Giovanni Paolo Colonna, who had become acquainted with the famous Giacomo Carissimi in Rome. Carissimi introduced him to the resources of the sacred oratorio and offered him the organist’s post at the Chiesa di Sant’Apollinare.

The selected concertos by Georg Christoph Wagenseil, Giuseppe Bonno, Florian Leopold Gassmann, and Matthias Georg Monn, heard here on historical instruments, represent a significant contribution to the artistic recovery of the forgotten Viennese music culture of this epoch, a field that is only beginning to be researched. When Emperor Carl VI died in 1740, his successor Maria Theresa inherited a state budget burdened by heavy deficits. Forced to adopt economy measures, the new empress suspended the operation of the court orchestra and then offered its services to interested parties. However, the artistically marginalized musicians did not accept defeat when these unexpected developments put them in an existentially precarious position. No longer obliged to serve and obey a court aesthetic, they delighted in experimentation with new styles and forms of expression. The revolutionary character of these exciting times very much may be viewed as preparation for the Viennese classical period. Moreover, the flute now became a solo instrument for use in the orchestra and concert performances. Until about 1740 it was only rarely employed and then merely for additional tone color, but now it first enjoyed its share of spotlight."

Old Vienna was created as its idyllic opposite, as the fiction of a Biedermeier city in which life was a dream, an image that continues to exercise its fascination even today. Bruderlein fein treats a fictional episode from the life of the legendary composer Joseph Drechsler. From 1822 to 1830 he was the conductor at the Leopoldstadt Theater, where he wrote the stage music for Ferdinand Raimund’s Zaubermärchen. His last and most famous work, Der Verschwender, contains »Bruderlein fein,« the song from which the title of Fall’s one-act work was derived. For this delightful subject Leo Fall developed an affectionate tone, endowing it with a warm sound all of his own. The Neue Freie Presse went into raptures: ""Leo Fall has adorned the outstanding libretto with a sounding and singing wreath of sweet Old Viennese melodies numbering among the most fragrant gifts of this master so strong in feeling and emotion."" The premiere on 1 December 1909 was followed by 113 more performances in the Hölle Cabaret in the cellar of the Theater an der Wien, bringing Fall one of his greatest successes."

Active as a soloist and chamber musician, Aichhorn is one of the most sought-after and versatile harpists of her generation. Following her release featuring Eichner’s harp concertos, she now interprets for cpo three harp concertos by Johann Wilhelm Hertel, a composer regarded as one of the most important representatives of the empfindsamer Stil during the German preclassical period. His concerto oeuvre comprises some fifty solo concertos, and seventeen harpsichord concertos by him are known today. Three works – heard on this release – are assigned to the harp or harpsichord: ""Concerto per la Harpa o il Cembalo concertato.""

Now the Pleyel Quartet of Cologne, which during the course of its existence has gained fame above all for its rediscoveries of forgotten masterpieces of the string quartet literature, presents three more quartets by the Bergamo master – his early Quartets Nos. 1-3. Performed on original instruments, these quartets develop a special tonal appeal and offer astonishing examples of Donizetti’s compositional talent and special music feel. Since they are obliged to an older ideal, they combine seriousness and delightful sound; both technically and musically, demanding and entertaining elements maintain a balance. According to a friend’s memoirs, Donizetti wrote his first six string quartets at his desk, with the greatest concentration and without the assistance of the piano. On the one hand, they reflect impulses and influences from the Viennese quartet literature and from the Parisian quatuor concertant. On the other hand, they also show just how astonishingly quickly Donizetti was increasingly able to develop mastery while working with his models and contributing his own ideas."

On the present program she dedicates herself to Carl Reinecke’s chamber and concertante flute compositions, all of which he composed during the second half of his life. Along with the Undine Sonata op. 167 for flute and piano, today his most frequently performed work, the recording features the two concertante works written by him when he was over eighty years old. Here the initial dominance of stylistic elements associated with Mendelssohn has yielded to a tonal language that is both electrifying and highly individual. Reinecke’s music is diatonic in design but so strongly pervaded by semitones and suspensions that it also continues to flow. The »build-up phase« of the concertante last movements is only one of the procedures hardly invented by Reinecke but very much loved by him."

It is not a coincidence though that most of the pieces are transformations of initially different formats. Edvard Grieg was of course famous as a pianist and as a composer for the piano during his life. His studies at the Leipzig Conservatory with teachers such as Ignaz Moscheles and Carl Reinecke, who both were renowned as virtuoso players all over Europe, had shaped this part of his artistry. So many of his works were originally composed for the keyboard instrument which seemed to be the appropriate means of communicating the Nordic folk music idiom, which Grieg transferred perfectly well into art music. These beautiful miniatures disclose the difference between the piano and the string band version: the orchestra with its ability of grounding harmonies, playing dynamically with tones and phrases are probably even better suited to carry on the melancholy themes and moods than the piano with its more transient sustainability. So the string arrangement gives a perfect testament of what Grieg’s music with its special Nordic idiom is about: authentic varying moods full of melancholy, surprising harmony modulation, use of organ points combined with open fifths and last but not least endless melodies anticipating in some parts the Impressionism."

The album was inspired by the local culture, architecture, contemporary guitar music rooted in the Iberian tradition, and two guitars (6 and 10-string), which have been built for Staszewski in the recent years in Amalio Bourget’s luthier’s workshops in Valencia. Paraphrasing Joan Manen’s dedication, one could say that the pieces on the album are live music not written for the “drawer” but for particular performers, often in collaboration with them and thanks to their performance hints. The scores recorded on the album Fantasia Iberica cannot be found on the shelf labeled avant-garde, but who would think about revolutionizing the guitar’s sound, since it is irreplaceable in harmonics that echo within the walls of the Alcazar, in passages resembling paths of Spanish air, in rhythms of the sensual solea?"

He was also a formidable pianist, and wrote many pieces for his favorite instrument. Here, some of his rarer works are performed by Mario Patuzzi.

As a result the arts in general and the musical world in particular were so powerfully affected that, today, we can find no parallel in past centuries. Thus the twentieth century will be remembered as the century of diversity, when the confluence of so many different schools of thought gave birth to the most varied techniques and compositional styles, unhesitatingly burying all vestiges of post-Romanticism. Inevitably, the American musical landscape, consistently inheriting European trends, was imbued with this ‘experimental’ feel, leading to a diverse musical scene that breathes the air of Nadia Boulanger’s Paris with Aaron Copland and Elliott Carter, ‘moves away’ from sound with John Cage, and employs the full range of stylistic possibilities with John Corigliano; an America that adapts the old language to derive completely new and fresh music from elements inherited from the past. In a country where ‘classical’ music is not a native art, it became imperative to create music with an identity of its own that would reflect the thoughts and feelings of a people and to develop a school of American composers."

His celebrated Divine Comedy relates his supposed descent to Hell and slow ascent to Paradise. Godard’s operatic treatment of his life (1890) skilfully juxtaposes the political milieu – crowd scenes in Florence and the quarrel between Guelfs and Ghibellines – with the expression of the courtly love he feels for Beatrice, betrothed to his friend Bardi. The most remarkable element of the opera is the integration of a ‘Vision’ that is nothing less than a synthesis of the Divine Comedy set to music. Its third act is built around a fantasy ‘Hell’ and ‘Paradise’, featuring an Apparition of Virgil, Chorus of the Damned, Infernal Whirlwind, Divine Radiance and Apotheosis of Beatrice. Godard is here at the peak of his melodic inspiration and compositional mastery, in a style that brings Gounod up to date and need not fear comparison with Massenet."

This album is decidedly darker than his debut, both in tone and in subject matter, as Tobias makes use of a tonal palette more familiar to brooding alternative and popular music: lumbering straight 8th grooves, synthesizers, effects pedals, Rhodes and electric bass all coalesce underneath Tobias’s melodic modern jazz sensibility to form a single sound that is all at once engaging, grating and cathartic. As implied by the album’s title, Silent Dreamer is intended to recapture the essence of the unconscious imagination: both ethereal daydreams and bitter nightmares, as well as all the invisible worlds that live between the two. Tobias about his new album: “When improvising and composing, I like to think of myself as a ‘SOUND-PAINTER’ adding strokes to a canvas and bringing it to life.”"

The Vlaams Radio Koor (Flemish Radio Choir) was founded in 1937 by the Belgian public broadcaster of the day. Today it has become a choir of exceptionally high quality that counts both domestically and internationally among the top ensembles. The 24 professional singers rehearse under the baton of chief conductor Hervé Niquet in Studio 1 of the well-known Flagey building in Brussels, and perform throughout Flanders and Europe."

Long affiliated colleague and friend Jacques passionately pursued this Mozart project with Christina Petrowska Quilico right to the very end, with a performance at the Chautauqua Festival on July 11, 2015. At his suggestion, they sight-read all the Mozart Sonatas. It was so much fun that soon some late sonatas appeared on a concert. He then insisted that all of them be performed in one day. As Petrowska Quilico recalls when she asked why, his response was that of Sir Edmund Hillary on climbing Mount Everest: “Because it is there!” Jacques observed: “It’s fun to see in one day the evolution of the form in Mozart’s head. He started very young… and the last sonatas were written three years before he died.” That remark led to the accomplishment of actually performing all of the sonatas in a marathon concert. Out of that experience this recording project emerged. The marathon concert lasted seven and a half hours, with three very short breaks. The artists were so energized that they just had to duplicate the excitement of the live performances by recording the entire series."

After a memorable performance in Berlin a year earlier, Fitzgerald was once again singing to a packed concert hall. Norman Granz, serious and to the point, introduced the musicians. Lou Levy had long been accompanying Ella. The quartet took the stage with the singer herself. In her fresh, almost girlish voice and that hint of characteristic impertinence, she launched into “Too Close For Comfort”, followed by “On A Slow Boat To China”. By now the singer had the audience firmly in the palm of her hand. The performance was quite the opposite of what took place in a recording studio. Fitzgerald settled in as if she were in her living room, welcoming each spectator like a privileged guest and each song she sang, a gracefully proffered glass of champagne. The pieces had to be kept short because she had to see that all the members of the public were served. This release has captured that performance, and has been remastered for crystal-clear sound quality. It’s the closest thing to being right there in the audience those five decades ago."

But he thinks himself also called to a great future, and, disdainful of moral law, thinks himself justified in committing a crime, which he plans to do soon.

To overcome his own vulnerability, his own precariousness, man tries to assert himself, is active in making this fragility a force. For Laurence Vanin, “to be thrown into the world” is also to be thrown into an enigmatic world that it is important to understand in order to make it less frightening. It is to know that existence is strewn with trials and torments but that it needs to be sublimated. In short, to exist in fragility is to place on the horizon of its actions the possibility of happiness."

There is never any anger in this music; but you can hear revolt and melancholy, as in all the music I love. It's music for the unpopular, but people who are proud to be what they are. It's subversive music… The lyrics in rebetiko songs are words that can cure (…) Leaving your own country can be positive: new horizons, another way of living together… What I like about rebetiko is the assembly inside, West and East. That's where I come from: West and East have been inside of me since I was born."" Tony GATLIF After his ""Geronimo"", an admirable portrait of the tense relations between traditional culture and urban identity, filmmaker Tony Gatlif has now given us Djam, a masterful original soundtrack devoted to the music known as rebetiko. The humanity behind this popular music of Greek origin, a music of exile, migration and the cultural mix, stems from its origins in the region that ties Europe to Asia, a giant crossroads for migrating civilisations and historically a region of economic crisis. It is the centre of the world. Tony Gatlif is a filmmaker who symbolizes rhythm and liberty, and music is a central element in his filmography, with one Cesar Award already for """"Gadjo Dilo"""" and another for """"Vengo"""". His music in Djam follows the initiatory voyage of the heroine from Istanbul to Mytilene on Lesbos, and in turn its melodies breathe whisps of drunkenness, emotion and jubilant frenzy."

First came the military wind orchestras, which were also the first professional music ensembles after Bulgaria’s liberation from the Ottoman rule in 1878. They were created along with organizing the army. In March 1879, the first military wind orchestra was formed in Tarnovo. For a short time, from 3 orchestras in 1881, the ensembles became 31 in 1891, and during the Balkan War they were already 50. In the beginning, they performed marches, waltzes, overtures, mazurkas, etc. After that they expanded their repertoire with symphonies, excerpts from operas and operettas ... but a real development of wind orchestra music of Bulgarian sounding was noticed when the already experienced Bulgarian composers began to compose folk songs and folk-based suites. They thus set the ground for the genre called horos for wind orchestra, whose founder is the legendary Diko Iliev. His horos are a real inspiration for his younger followers. One of his most talented students was Andrei Vrachanski (1915-1990). He is the author of nearly 130 works, out of which 52 are horos. They are inspired by a specific story or experience, and to this day are among the most performed and loved by the people. Andrei Vrachanski began his studies as a student of Diko Iliev and bandmaster Alexander Wainer at the Wind Orchestra of the 36th Infantry Regiment of Kozloduy in 1935. Later, as a military musician in the regiment of Krumovgrad, he wrote his first horo pieces and thus lay the foundation of his rich and varied work."

Testament to that is the increasing interest on record in recent years of vocal music by the other composers represented on this recording – Steffani, Bononcini, Caresana and Marcello. Such was the brisk demand in aristocratic circles for these intimate duets from the 1680s onwards (even princesses commissioned them!), especially up through Italy and across the German lands, that active opera composers such as the London rivals, Handel and Bononcini, were as attracted to them as were fervent detractors of opera such as Marcello. In them the Mediterranean sensuality of the vocal line was reconciled with the Northern European taste for counterpoint. With the voices of Pe and Mineccia blending attractively together or taking on distinct characters as demanded by the music, Claudio Cavina brings all his innate musical understanding and experience in shaping this beguiling music and bringing out its delicate subtleties from the cello, harp, theorbo and harpsichord which make up La Venexiana on this occasion. Stefano Russomanno delves into the history of the vocal duet and provides a fascinating commentary to the mellifluous music-making of the two countertenors."

There are plenty of firm favourites here – Rameau’s “Tristes apprêts” (Castor et Pollux) and “Forêts paisibles” (Les Indes galantes), but one of the additional attractions of this double-disc extravaganza released by Glossa is the chance to hear music of quality by hitherto woefully ignored compositions (Le Retour du printemps, Antoine Dauvergne, Les Caracteres de la Folie, Bernard de Bury or Le Pouvoir de l’Amour, Pancrace Royer), all demonstrating the depths of quality still waiting to be rediscovered. And there are selections to be had from operas by Mondonville, Destouches, Leclair and Francoeur and Rebel as well.

The work is claimed by many to have an external ‘war’ programme, a fact dismissed by the composer. Either way the result is undoubtedly one of Vaughan Williams’ finest works; a tightly woven musical statement, with stunning melodies and orchestration which is at turns dramatic and expressive. The Fourth Symphony was first performed in 1925 and, echoed the relative dissonance of recent works such as the oratorio Sancta Civitas, the Piano Concerto and the masque for Dancing Job.

Similarly, the chilling sparseness of textures becomes an emotionallandscape, scarred, sometimes painfully severe, where inner strength is necessary for survival. But there is, too, especially in the Duet For Violin And Piano, a sanctity of mood (shared with the later Shostakovich, when he was obsessed with death, and where, in his final works such as the Viola Sonata and Sonata For Violin And Piano, the influence of Ustvolskaya may be felt). ln moments like this, rare is the music where the human will is so immediate, so enduring."

Eric has been variously described as a crusty eccentric, wonderfully humorous, very healthy and resourceful American composer of gentle, witty, lyrically accessible music, with a taste for folkloric Americana and a “Whitmanesque” ear. This collection of chamber music, delightfully performed by some of those closest to him, shows his range and deep respect for performers and listeners. The works are as fun to play as they are to hear, and bring to mind the affable collegiality and the pragmatic purpose of his musical life. There are echoes of Charles Ives, Henry Brant, John Cage thrown into the mix of lyrical whimsy and solid recital craft. Song, poetry, music for special occasions, friendly offerings, audience participation, and educational twists all take center stage in this album; as much a tribute to Eric’s living gifts as it is a reminiscence of a bygone day."

A composer for whom the string quartet is the perfect medium to express, in a modern idiom, his passion for the contemplative aspects of Renaissance vocal music, the album includes three of Stanley Grill’s many string quartets: American landscapes, Lonely Voices and the title track, At the Center of All Things. Raised in New York City, Stanley Grill has spent a lifetime composing music as an act of translation, trying to understand the world and convey that understanding in musical terms. Two main themes carry through in his work- music composed as a reflection of the physical world and music composed to inspire and promote world peace. These themes are at the heart of all three works included on At the Center of All Things. The unique sound that emerges from the Diderot Quartet’s period instruments is ideal for these three introspective and intensely personal works. On this album, the Diderot gives a brilliant, evocative performance that perfectly captures the nature of the composer’s work- music that is completely contemporary while simultaneously looking back in time to the beauty and harmony of early vocal music."

Having conquered the Big Apple with their rendition of Steve Reich’s Music for 18 Musicians, and then turning to Terry Riley’s In C, performing and remixing it for their most recent innova album, they now return home to see what they can come up with on their own. Their wholesome farm-to-table freshness is apparent in this new album where three alumni wrote acoustic music for the group and then took back the recordings to play with in the studio. Return may not have had to look beyond its own back yard for materials, but this album of hybrid electronic-acoustic audio landscapes opens up a wide musical horizon- forward gazing, a big chill and sentimental, with surprises along the way. In the end it is a youthful vision of beauty unencumbered by textbook dogma. And to polish it all off, the mastering was done by Grammy winner Randy Merrill at Sterling Sound. All the music on this album was written by three former students of ensemble director and composer Bill Ryan: Daniel Rhode, Adam Cuthbert, and matt Finch.

Hassler inspires the listener with his playful virtuosity, a good sense of humour and a musical imagination without borders. For Hans Hassler, performing on a variety of stages, to return to the studio as a soloist means adding something significant to anything which has already been played. It doesn’t necessarily have to be new or different; it has to be substantial. Hans Hassler has retained something of the originality of his playing. He combines this elemental, physical and spontaneously deployed music-making power with a finely tuned sense for artistic form. Appropriately enough for this two-handed instrument, this often involves a dialogue across the spectrum between heavenly descant and droning lowlands. There are ethereal lone notes and powerful clusters of tones, and altogether a great deal of dynamics, scurrility, humour, drama and thoughtfulness. That, if we wish to name it, is Hassler music."

The album title Asteroida is the Latin term for starfish – a creature that can regenerate parts of itself whenever need be. That idea resonates with Crump because of the trio’s ability to steadily develop new landscapes, and the Stephan Crump reminds that the word starfish conjures notions of both the ocean and outer space. ‘Gravity, magnetism, constellations, nature. With this band, we’re always expanding and contracting, recontextualizing what’s around us and heading for the instantly inevitable.’... Ultimately Asteroidea is a treatise on immediacy and a deep dive into the spectrum of responses made by any one gesture. Pay close attention.

After 12 years of negotiation, ICA Classics has signed an exclusive long term agreement with the Lyrita Recorded Edition who are responsible for the Richard Itter Trust. The collection is very important for collectors because it has never been released before onto the market. Herbert von Karajan’s association with the Philharmonia Orchestra started in 1948 and continued to 1960. Despite this long relationship, there are practically no live recordings from London’s Royal Festival Hall of Karajan and the Philharmonia caught ‘on the wing.’ Karajan’s live Philharmonia account of Tchaikovsky’s Symphony No. 4 in 1955 is an unrestrained version of his studio recording of 1953 which The Gramophone described as ‘phenominal, a record in a thousand.’ Ravel’s Rapsodie espagnole was played in London just prior to Karajan’s Philharmonia tour of the USA in Autumn 1955 and was thought at the time to be even more sensuously beautiful than his widely praised studio account with the Philharmonia from 1953. The Mozart concert is important because it features the Romanian pianist Clara Haskil with whom Karajan had an extraordinary rapport. Since they were both contracted to different companies, they never recorded together which makes this memento of their collaboration especially valuable. Futhermore, this live 1956 London performance of the ‘Jupiter’ Symphony also fills an important gap in Karajan’s PHilharmonia discography, since a studio recording begun in August 1953 was never completed."

Jurowski’s interpretation is based on his view that Acts 1 & 2 inhabit a Romantic sound world and then between Act 2 and 3, the sound changes completely becoming drier with much sharper outlines. He has said that if it were not for Tchaikovsky’s untimely death, he would have developed a similar style of composition to Stravinsky between 1917 and 1928, around the time of Pulcinella. The Sleeping Beauty recorded here is performed complete. The State Academic Symphony Orchestra of Russia is one of Russia’s oldest orchestras dating back to 1936.

And while Chausson excites us as a composer through the lofty aesthetic demands of his music, he also cuts an attractive figure as a man: decent, generous and immensely learned. One of Chausson’s masterpieces, the Quartet Op. 30 began to take shape in September 1897. Cyclical in form, the Quartet is a bright and energetic work, with charm and beauty. Gustav Mahler entered the Vienna Conservatory at the age of 15, taking classes in counterpoint and composition. One year later, he composed the Piano Quartet in A minor, which remains his only surviving work of chamber music. It holds a special significance, the bulk of the music from Mahler’s youth having since been lost or destroyed. It was given its first public performance on July 10, 1876, with the composer at the piano, but appears to have been lost at some point thereafter. A manuscript was rediscovered by Mahler’s wife, Anna, in the early 1960s."

With innovative sounds and utopian ideas, the Russian composer, philosopher and mystic challenged not only performers and listeners of his time, but also frameworks of thought, categories of history, and limits of art. Scriabin’s seemingly egocentric outlook, megalomania and delusions have been psychoanalyzed, ridiculed, and brushed aside. Nonetheless, he sincerely believed himself that art in general, and his own music especially, could change the world and elevate humanity to a new and higher level of consciousness. In spite of small pianist hands and symphonic opposition, Scriabin continued to composer music both for orchestra and for piano, music which few have fully understood and which none have managed to copy. Even in his early works- such as the Piano Concerto and Symphony No. 2- he was about to break with tradition and create his own style and musical expression. And perhaps at the same time he was taking important steps on the road toward the great Mystery that awaited him at the foot of the Himalayas, though only he can provide an answer.

The composer had already given birth to the acerbic, neo-classical take on texts by Edith Sitwell that was Façade (1922). Two years later he spent a season knocking out foxtrots for the Savoy Orpheus Band, and even started work on a concerto for two pianos, jazz band and orchestra. Four years after that, Walton hatched plans for his first orchestral concerto proper: a score that would take elements from both those pieces but would stand with at least one foot in the late Romantic tradition of Elgar, Bax and others. After being drawn to the viola as an instrument of depth, Walton decided that a Viola Concerto was viable. In the words of the composer’s biographer Michael Kennedy, the ‘dark and huskily passionate sound of the viola became the perfect medium for the [concerto’s] prevailing mood of plaintive melancholy.

Originaly from Calatayud and from the generation that flourished after composer Juan Hidalgo, Navas followed Hidalgo’s footsteps to the point of declaring himself chosen by Hidalgo as his successor after Hidalgo’s demise in 1685. In any case, Navas officially requested Hidalgo’s Chapel position in 1688, which was granted (although not with the same salary as Hidalgo, as he had requested) and which he maintained until his death in October of 1719. During the period as Royal Chapel harpist, Navas composed music for courtesan festivities and theatrical works, of which at least thirteen are known, even if the number of pieces that survived intact is considerably less. In fact, only one of his theatrical productions has survived in its entirety, the zarzuela Destinos vencen finezas. Only parts of his other zarzuelas survive in the form of tonos, tonadas, and arias that have acquired a life of their own beyond their original theatrical context. Navas emerged at the end of the seventeenth century as one of the heirs, together with Juan de Serqueira, of Hidalgo’s musical style, and his pieces form a relatively homogeneous repertoire despite the introduction of more modern elements, such as the use of obbligato instrumental parts."

Luigi Boccherini is a pivotal, albeit controversial, figure in Spanish music history. On the one hand, his birth in Lucca in Italy marginalized him from the discourses with a nationalist tinge expounded by Spanish musicologists of the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries, despite the fact that most of his life and career were spent under the wing of Spanish instutitions. Traditional historiography has considered Joseph Haydn the inventor of two instrumental genres of great importance in all later music: the symphony and the string quartet. The supposed invention, which in reality consisted of the adoption of the local Viennese style as a universal model of composition, helped to establish a German-centric canon that considered all other composing traditions, like the style of Boccherini, as inferior. Fortunately, many musicologists have studied various aspects of the life and work of Boccherini, offering a revised image of the composer. This historiographical revision, together with the elaboration of the definitive edition of his works, brings evidence of the high quality and depth of his music and contradicts the idea of the isolation that Boccherini supposedly suffered in Spain."

With a partnership honed over many concerts and several recordings together, including a Grammy-nominated Die schöne Mullerin, the pair turn their attention to two of the greatest song cycles of the nineteenth century. The recording opens with Schumann’s Op. 39, Liederkreis, settings of Joseph von Eichendorff’s poems, and finishes with Mahler’s Lieder eines fahrenden Gesellen, written around forty years later. The songs selected all tell, in varying hues, of the Romantic individual’s sense of alienation from others and of transcendence, or the longing for it. An expressive and accomplished storyteller Boesch’s perceptive phrasing and exquisite range of colours is well matched by Martineau’s virtuosic and perfectly synchronized accompaniment."

On Parle qui veut the performers embrace the exuberant style of flourishing melodies which was fashionable in the north of Italy in the fourteenth century. In contrast, a different kind of expressivity is required for the sober and succinct aesthetic of the works with French provenance. Sollazzo creates a pure, bright sound, enhanced by the songs’ incredibly open textures and the use of the rarely heard Pythagorean temperament. All in all, this represents a remarkable debut."

Simon Rattle and Peter Sellars go headstrong into a bright future with the London Symphony Orchestra...’ The Guardian ‘Rattle draws shimmering beauty from the forest...’ The Standard ‘Rattle’s conducting was immaculate... the performance has made me think about the work again, wondering how far I should prod that glorious surface to see what lies beneath.’ The Spectator ‘A magnificent achievement.’ Seen and Heard International Sir Simon Rattle leads an all-star cast in this highly anticipated new recording of Debussy’s evocative opera Pelleas et Melisande. It was captured in January 2016 during performances of an innovative collaboration between Rattle and Peter Sellars, two of the boldest creative minds in music and theatre today. Supported by the London Symphony Chorus, prepared by renowned choral director Simon Halsey, it is a moving statement of intent for Rattle’s tenure as LSO Music Director. The plot, a love triangle between Prince Golaud, his wife Melisande and his brother Pelleas, is shrouded in mystery and full of gripping twists and emotion-filled turns, ultimately ending in Pelleas’s untimely death. The sensuous score contains some of Debussy’s most exquisite music and perfectly crystalises the atmosphere of Maeterlinck’s original play. Debussy himself explained the appeal of the work: ‘The drama of Pelleas which, despite its dream like atmosphere, contains far more humanity than those so-called “real life documents”, seemed to suit my intentions admirably. In it there is an evocative language whose sensitivity could be extended into music and into the orchestral backcloth.’"

I wish that … critics and public could get as worked up about new music as they do about football and cricket’. This cri de coeur from composer Peter Racine Fricker (1920-1990) captures the passion and conviction with which he approached his craft. Fricker was born on 5 September 1920 in Ealing, London. He was educated at St. Paul’s School, London and entered the Royal College of Music in 1937. Upon demobilisation he resumed formal composition lessons with the Hungarian emigre composer Mátyás Seiber, who had lived in England since 1935. In 1952 he was appointed musical director of Morley College (succeeding Michael Tippett) and held this post for the next 12 years. During this period he was also a Professor of Composition at the RCM. Fricker was the first British composer to make his reputation entirely after World War II. Among the first composers in Britain to be influenced by the music of Bela Bartók, Arnold Schoenberg and Igor Stravinsky, Fricker assimilated aspects of their very different styles into a distinctive voice of his own. He proceeded to build an impressive body of work in his highly expressive, urbane and freely atonal language."

A native of this region of Romania, she was one of the last of many rising young musicians who was able to study organ there. In 1990 she was appointed to an instructorship at the renowned Klausenburg/Cluj Conservatory. Her recording “Transylvanian Organ Landscape” received the German record Critics Prize."

However, Luther’s fruitful juxtaposition of “transmitted” and “modern” music shows that he was also fond of drawing on songs from the “old church.” The Lutheran chorale masses recorded by Hermann Max with his Rheinische Kantorei on vinyl more than thirty years ago represent a special form within these parallel- or shared- relational worlds. Even then the MDG sound engineers used the latest digital technology for the recording. Along with the chorale masses by Christoph Bernhard, Friedrich Wilhelm Zachow, and Johann Caspar Ferdinand Fischer, Hermann Max presents three works that were highly modern during their times. Schein’s composed interpretations of his source texts ventured onto terrain normally reserved for theologians- at least in the old church. But this too is in the spirit of the Reformation: the “priesthood of all believers” can of course not be excluded from the musical sphere! And so this valuable new edition expands our view of Protestant church music, from a much too rarely considered but welcome perspective."

This album features Ludmila Berlinskaya, a pianist, teacher and representative of the glorious music dynasty, performing with the New Russian Quartet, a string ensemble formed in 2008 that has won the recognition of domestic and international audiences. The recording also features Igor Fedorov, one Russia’s best clarinetists. Two large-scale works are the bedrock of the programme – piano quintets by Nikolai Medtner and Dmitri Shostakovich. For Medtner, who left the revolutionary Russia and lived in need for many years, the quintet was his last piece – he finished it in 1948 although he had nurtured the idea for more than 20 years. Dmitri Shostakovich finished his quintet before the Great Patriotic War. Eminently speaking, this is one of the master’s “classical” pieces notable for its vivid imagery, depth and transparency of sound. The album also includes two ensembles for piano and strings with clarinet. These are Sergei Prokofiev’s Overture on Hebrew Themes (1919) and the Sextet by contemporary Moscow composer Alexei Kurbatov.

Yury Martynov is one of the most interesting and versatile Russian musicians of our days whose performing artblends the best traditions of the Russian piano and West European clavier schools. He is also known as one of those rare musicians who have a complete command of actually all historical varieties of keyboard instruments – such performers are few and far between. The graduate of the Moscow Conservatory specializing in piano, organ and chamber ensemble, Martynov also did a course of the harpsichord and basso continuo in Paris. Although the pianist prefers to play music on the instrument of the period it was written in, he doesn’t avoid performing the clavier repertoire on the modern grand piano. Yury Martynov’s numerous recordings have been acclaimed by music critics and prestigious Russian and foreign periodicals. The discs include two late sonatas by Franz Schubert recorded by Yury Martynov in 2006 (on a modern Steinway & Sons grand piano). The better known Sonata in B flat major (No. 21) published posthumously is a swan song of the prematurely deceased genius, an extensive canvas incorporating the most characteristic features of Schubert’s style of the last years. The bright drama of the Sonata in A minor (No. 16) with its almost orchestral richness of sound in the extreme movements receives a thoughtful and convincing rendition from Yury Martynov."

The revision was the result of conductor Hermann Scherchen, who was critical of the size of the score and of elements of its instrumentation. He agreed to perform it if certain revisions were made. Ultimately, the première of the revised version, Metastaseis B, would be conducted by Hans Rosbaud at Donaueschingen in 1955, where it created a sensation.

It’s an album which moves nimbly and light-footed, almost dancer-like between a club sound and traditional jazz. Elements of funk, latin, rock, blues, soul, R&B, disco and pop fall naturally into place. They combine to form an amazing blend that makes you sit up and listen.

We know, however, that he wrote sacred works throughout his life. The work which most of all represents Boccherini’s vocal output in the eyes of the wider public is the Stabat Mater G. 532. It is the original version of the Stabat Mater composed in 1781and scored for soprano and string quintet which is recorded here. The Quintet op. 45 No.1 featured on this disc is an unfamiliar work. It was written during March 1792, at which time Boccherini was employed as composer to the court of King Friedrich Wilhelm II of Prussia. Referred to as an “Opera Grande” according to Boccherini’s classification, the piece is considered to be one of the maturest works of Boccherini’s German period: at a time of significant development in the string quintet, the composer attains a rare harmonic and melodic balance in which the two cellos, never doubling one another, attain an almost symphonic autonomy that erases all trace of their one-time continuo role."

Each of them having three movements, in the initial and final Allegros the violin, the indisputable protagonist, giving vent, shows off with captivating virtuosity, supported by a precise and well constructed bass. The Adagios are superb, placed as a contrast between the two extreme quick movements where the cantabile nature of the writing for the violin is full of ""melos"" making these pages quite enjoyable.

Based in Kansas, Beckham is part of an important generation of composers who, in the latter half of the twentieth century, persisted in their pursuit of a classically Romantic aesthetic. To this end, Beckham’s orchestral music is stalwartly thematic, crisply orchestrated, and centered on dramatic melodic and harmonic ideas. The music on this album demonstrates Beckham is also a facile, expert orchestrator, who can draw any mood with the instruments at hand. In this regard, the album’s longest work, Feather Sound, is the most dynamic. At first plaintive, the piece is enlivened by triumphant percussion and brass, and includes a variety of wonderful textures, particularly in its heavily contrapuntal sections. Feather Sound features an impressive and intricate section dominated by a web of canons, which Beckham deftly illustrates with crystal clear and clever orchestration. Feather Sound also speaks to Beckham’s attraction to lyrical and thematic melodic material, a characteristic that dominates the other works in this collection. Fanfare 40, though brief, features a handful of memorable themes, some stately and others more delicate and charming. Like in Feather Sound, Beckham is cleverly economical here, and uses sections of counterpoint to re-purpose and disguise his ideas, giving the listener the sense that we are hearing something new, when in fact, the opposite is the case. Fanfare 40 also features structurally significant orchestration, as to the two themes at the heart of work are scored very contrastingly. Memorial Ode, the remaining work on the album, again demonstrates Beckham’s skill at painting mood through orchestration. Its contemplative opening, scored simply for solo flute and chimes, is extraordinarily compelling, so much so Beckham meaningfully recalls aspects of this texture later in the piece. The remainder of Memorial Ode is dominated by elegant and glorious re-settings of Ralph Vaughan Williams’ “Sine nomine” hymn tune, which was a favorite of the work’s dedicatee, Harold Romoser. HIGHLIGHTS Dwight Beckham’s orchestral music is defined by Romantic lyricism and crisp, clear orchestration, which particularly shines in contrapuntal sections Feather Sound, being the longest work, is the most texturally dynamic work on the album, while Fanfare 40 and Memorial Ode are the most classically thematic"

The nocturnes and ballades are also some of Chopin’s most innovative works, displaying exciting advancements in harmony, rhythm, and form—all renewed in pianist Eliane Rodrigues’s nuanced, thoughtful performances, recorded in Sacilie, Italy’s acoustically advanced Fazioli Concert Hall. Although he didn’t invent the piano nocturne, Chopin popularized it and certainly improved it beyond a mere character piece. He was heavily influenced by the sensuous melodies of bel canto opera arias, and developed a freer sense of rhythm and expression—as a result, the nocturnes exude an abstract mood or atmosphere. Chopin did, however, invent the piano ballade—a genre with its own distinct forms and qualities. His four ballades most directly contrast the nocturnes in their abstract narrative style—very different from “mood” pieces, they were likely inspired by poems by Adam Mick iewicz.Taking a page from Chopin’s own unwritten ballade narratives, Rodrigues includes text by Jantien Brys to accompany each nocturne, each one telling a sort of story without sacrificing the essential atmospheric nature of the nocturne. She writes, “For me, the Nocturnes are like a diary of Chopin, so Jantien wrote the texts as if they were excerpts from a fictional diary of his.” Rodrigues’s performances, influenced by these new texts, bring the listener a new kind of emotional connection to Chopin and music. HIGHLIGHTS Eliane Rodrigues was born in Rio de Janeiro, where she began composing at three, played her first recital at five, and performed with an orchestra at six. From there, she won prizes at age 18 at the Van Cliburn Competition in the United States and was a laureate at the 1983 Queen Elisabeth Competition. Rodrigues has a truly international performing presence. She has performed in Antwerp, Brussels, The Hague, Moscow, New York, Rio de Janeiro, St. Petersburg, Volgograd, Zurich, and elsewhere. In 1998, she was the leading artist at the Música Romântica music festival in Switzerland, featured as performer, conductor, and composer. Rodrigues makes her home in the Netherlands, where, in Rotterdam, she gives an annual Chopin recital at De Doelen on the day after Christmas. She is currently professor at the Royal Conservatoire of Antwerp, where she has taught for many years. Rodrigues has produced over 25 CDs featuring live and studio recordings. These include recordings of Prokofiev’s five piano concertos and several Beethoven works, including recent recordings of all of his piano concertos in St. Petersburg."

Commissioned by the Boston-based experimental opera company Guerilla Opera, and premiered in 2011, this recording coincides with a new production of Loose, Wet, Perforated that involves video projection and audience interaction. The work, whose libretto was also written by Vines, is a satirical and metaphorical take on the medieval genre of the morality play. Described by Vines and Guerilla Opera as “American Idol meets The Hunger Games meets The Price is Right”, the story follows the trials of two protagonists, ‘Loose’ and ‘Wet’. As the aforementioned description suggests, this is no ordinary story. The morality play’s context is bizarre – Loose and Wet are competing to ascend within a secret organization, and at stake is the possibility of fame and fortune, or total isolation. The staged production’s sets, costumes, and, in particular, video projection underscore the opera’s dark humor and absurdism. With these elements inaccessible on the audio recording, the listener is still transported into the opera’s world by Vines’ enthralling score and libretto. Of course, the narrative’s clarity in the recording testifies to the excellent vocal performances by Guerilla Opera’s Alana de la Guardia (‘Loose’), Brian Church (‘Wet’), Doug Dodson (‘Perforated’), and Thea Lobo (Various). The recording’s evocative scene-setting comes primarily from Vines’ instrumental score, which employs the unusual ensemble of clarinet, saxophone, trombone, and percussion. This quartet produces an incredible array of sounds and moods, enabling Vines to convey every emotion of his strange and symbolic story. Perhaps the most memorable musical idea in the work occurs at the beginning and end of the opera, when, in accompaniment of expository text, Vines scores a web of moaning pitch bends for his three wind instruments. This material is particularly visceral and poignant, and helps establish the fact that, though lessons from Loose, Wet, Perforated may apply to our reality, the opera takes place in a world very different from ours."

The quartet notes that through studying these works the group was able to find their artistic voices both as individuals as well as an ensemble. Through listening to their performances, one can really get a sense of their personal connection to these pieces, and that reverence only helps to highlight the personal connection Shostakovich felt to these quartets as well. In fact, these three quartets are each written in honor of different person or group he felt a close connection to.Shostakovich’s Seventh Quartet was written in memory of his first wife, she had died suddenly from complications during an emergency surgery. He even goes so far as to write “To live for you! To die for you!” in his score; that anguish is abundantly clear through the complex and chromatic harmonies he brings forth. Altius’ blazing technical facilities in the allegretto is nothing short of awesome, and their careful balancing of Shostakovich’s dense harmonies makes even the strongest of dissonances ring sonorously. Written after reluctantly joining the Communist Party and in the midst of his first instance of debilitating muscle fatigue, Shostakovich dedicated the Eighth Quartet “to the victims of fascism and the war.” Whether this is a reference to the atrocities he experienced during World War II or an expression of his closeted dissent of his country’s regime, the brooding largo and visceral allegretto demonstrate that this quartet could be dedicated to victims anywhere. In this work, the group’s cohesion comes to the forefront; the way in which the group can achieve dynamic unity in every swell and change allows the atmospheres that Shostakovich intended to come vividly to life. Finally, the Ninth Quartet was written in dedication to his third wife and it’s clear this work is written with a much more hopeful tone than his other pieces. For instance, this quartet doesn’t end with a morendo like so many of his other works; in fact, the quartet ends with a luminous forte. Even within the first few measures, it’s clear the ensemble has taken the time to live within the work. Although contingent upon rhythmic accuracy, the group still allows each phrase to breathe, ebb, and flow; all within perfect unison of one another. In the following brisker movements, the group is still able to convey the passion and fervor this work emits, whether it be the softest sul tasto or strongest fortissimo. HIGHLIGHTS This is Altius Quartet’s second Navona Records release, following their debut DRESS CODE. Each of these works were written in the early 1960’s, arguably one of the most tumultuous points in Shostakovich’s life."

When Strether finds Chad, he discovers an altered man and becomes introduced to a free and unconventional style of life that soon intoxicates him. His views begin to change; the morality of Woollett, his hometown, becomes foreign, and the ‘ambassador’ loses sight of his mission… Part tragedy, part comedy, The Ambassadors is a rewarding portrait about one man’s late awakening. John Chancer is an award-winning narrator of many audiobooks. His soft American accent lends an authenticity to James’s intercontinental tale."

Gerald Crich, son of a wealthy colliery owner, captures the heart of Gudrun, while Ursula becomes enamoured with Rupert Birkin, a school inspector- their complex relationship likely modeled on that between Lawrence, his wife Frieda, and John Middleton Murry and Katherine Mansfield. Things are far from harmonious, and the discord and conflict leads to many heated and elaborate philosophical discussions about modern society and the nature of love, while tragedy looms large.

After hearing Biret play for him in Paris, Gilels asked Biret if she would like to perform in the USSR.

Without hesitation she accepted to undertake this monumental task. This was a project that would be the dream and dread of many a pianist and the past decades were full of projects to record Chopin’s complete works which remained unfinished for various reasons. Idil Biret was not known as a Chopin performer. Indeed until she started recording for Naxos she had played few of his works in public. During much of her career she had stayed distant from Chopin. Later, Biret studied with Alfred Cortot, considered by many as the greatest Chopin interpreter of the twentieth century, for two years when he was in his eighties. With him Biret worked on almost the entire Chopin repertory. Cortot’s teachings were in the great tradition of Chopin performance of the 19th and early 20th centuries. Biret remembers vividly “the glorious, magical sounds that came from the piano when Cortot put his hands on it; almost like that of a cello” as she recalled in an interview on BBC Radio.

They liberated contemporary music from the dogmatic clutches of serialism and gave it a new simplicity of compositional structure and harmony, repetitive elements and an uncompromising reduction of the musical material. Hence “Minimal Music” became timeless in two senses: like a perpetuum mobile, once set in motion it appears to be able to remain endlessly in motion from within, and develops in the process an almost psychedelic pull that knows neither beginning nor end. At the same time, with its patterns, loops and drones, it smoothed the path for genres like ambient, techno and post-rock.

He and his electro trio play in clubs like Berlin’s Berghain, plus he performs works with Ensemble Modern and radio symphony orchestras. Motschmann builds up his music from small motivic cells – like Mahler or Wagner – into higher-level structures. That applies as much to his pieces for trio as to his orchestral works. Facets of Infinity, with the Frankfurt Opera orchestra – Museumsorchester Frankfurt – at full strength and Spark as solo performer, makes that perfectly clear: not only does Motschmann quote from his Electric Fields album in this huge work, he combines these quotations with a seemingly endless melody – almost in the manner of Morton Feldman."

Orpheus’s musical gifts are supreme, animals, plants and even stones, move in order to better hear him sing and play his lyre. He sings his plea to the ruler of the underworld who does allow him to take Eurydice back with him under the condition that he not look back to check to see if she is still there. When Orpheus crosses the threshold back to the surface he can no longer resist and he looks back but Eurydice has not yet crossed and she is immediately drawn back to the underworld, gone for ever. Orpheus mourns but eventually comes to terms with his loss. Later, a mob of Thracian women in a Dionysian Orgy rip Orpheus apart. Dismembered, his head and lyre float down a stream, his head still singing and his lyre still playing until they rest at the head of the stream and become an oracle.

These have been juxtaposed with new works by Robert Hugill, Jonathan Lee, David Bednall and Peter Leech, many of which are set to texts which deal with the subjects of heavenly light and remembrance, hence the title of the album. The choir is extremely grateful to Adrian Farmer for providing the inspiration for this project, which is dedicated to the memory of the very fine organist and composer Christopher Manners LRAM, who died suddenly in 2013."

A consummate musician - equally accomplished as recitalist, concerto soloist or chamber musician - she has been heralded for her ‘fiery intensity and emotional depth’ (Musical America) as well as for her technical mastery. Her supreme blend of artistry and musicianship continues to inspire audiences worldwide. Miriam Fried has played with virtually every major orchestra in the United States and Europe and has been a frequent guest with the principal orchestras of Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, New York, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, as well as with the Israel Philharmonic, the London Symphony, the Royal Philharmonic and the Vienna Symphony. Recital tours have taken her to all of the major music centers in North America and to Brussels, London, Milan, Munich, Rome, Paris, Salzburg, Stockholm and Zurich. Chamber music plays an important role in Ms. Fried's musical life. She was the first violinist of the Mendelssohn String Quartet for ten years and collaborates regularly with her son, pianist Jonathan Biss. During the 2015-16 season, Ms. Fried returned to the Bach solo Sonatas and Partitas. She recorded a series of lectures addressing performance questions relating to these works."

However, regardless of whether we look to the modal harmonies of Songs of Loss and Regret or the multi-layered serial counterpoint of the finale of the Third Symphony, we still find a unifying sense of a strong and individual artistic personality. In his symphonic works, we hear an uncommonly accomplished resultion of some of the aesthetic tensions which have gripped so much music to grow out of the Central European tradition in the generations after Mahler and Schoenberg. Sawyers works with a spectrum of musical materials ranging from diatonic and modal material through to twelve-tone themes with a striking mixture of rigor and imaginative flexibility."

The album includes two major tone poems by Jean Sibelius (1865–1957), Tapiola and En Saga, combined with a set of songs orchestrated by Aulis Sallinen (b. 1935) in 2015. Sibelius’ magnificent tone poem Tapiola, written shortly after the 7th Symphony, may be regarded as the culmination of a period that began with the Fifth Symphony, a period where Sibelius created music that grew organically out of tiny germs into huge processes. It was completed in 1926 and remained Sibelius’s last great orchestral work. In Tapiola, Sibelius appears to equate the primacy of nature with the value of art for its own sake, the unattainable truths of which remain uneroded by time or by the shifting ideals of mankind. Sibelius stated to his private secretary: “My inspiration for Tapiola came wholly from nature, or even more accurately from something inexpressible in words.” The genesis of En Saga, originally premiered in 1892, is also shrouded in mystery, and even later in life Sibelius was reluctant to go into any detail regarding its content. It is among Sibelius’ earliest orchestral works, and its original title in Swedish, En saga, refers to ancient Nordic tales of heroes and gods. Although En saga is among the most popular works by Sibelius today, the premiere of the work was not a success and Sibelius revised the score in 1902. On the occasion of the 150th anniversary of Sibelius’s birth in 2015 composer Aulis Sallinen (b. 1935) orchestrated a cycle of songs for mezzosoprano Anne Sophie von Otter. This cycle of eight songs contains several less known songs in a cavalcade juxtaposing human emotions and innermost thoughts with the natural environment and experiences in nature. The recent recordings by the Finnish Radio Symphony Orchestra under Hannu Lintu on Ondine have gathered excellent reviews in the international press."

Vogt’s recordings of chamber music with the trio have gathered astonishing reviews and recording awards, including Grammy nomination for the recording of Brahms Piano Trios (ODE 1271-2D). Beethoven’s Triple Concerto for Piano, Violin, and Cello in C major, Op. 56 is a work radiant with joy, described by many as a concerto for piano trio and orchestra. The work, completed in 1803, has standed unrivaled in its genre. Beethoven’s Piano Concerto No. 3 in C minor, Op. 37 is a slightly earlier work and it was premiered together with his Symphony No. 2 in a concert in 1804. It has been noted that the theme in the first movement of the concerto is possibly a quotation from Mozart’s Piano Concerto No. 24 written in the same key, and the both works do ressemble each other in formal, rhythmic, and thematic aspects. C minor key is also a key in which Beethoven wrote many of his most important works, including the 5th Symphony, the Pathetique Sonata and Piano Sonata, Op. 111. Lars Vogt was appointed the first ever “Pianist in Residence” by the Berlin Philharmonic in 2003/04 and enjoys a high profile as a soloist and chamber musician.

The concertos are combining multiple styles from Baroque to prog jazz as well as different performance practices. Romer’s Gap is a concerto for electrically amplified cello featuring as soloist Perttu Kivilaakso, best known as lead cellist in the multi-million selling rock band Apocalyptica. Ambrosian Delights is a concerto for the knifonium, a vacuum-tube-based analogue synthesiser created by Jonte Knif. Multikolor, written for Joonatan Rautiola, is a single-movement work for baritone sax and small chamber orchestra. All three works are recorded by the Jyväskylä Sinfonia under conductor Ville Matvejeff. “The three concertos on this album were written within a relatively short space of time, between 2013 and 2016. They reflect basic themes in my music in different ways, including my relationship to tradition and the problems of combining multiple”, composer Olli Virtaperko describes in his liner notes, and continues: “What links these three concertos is that the solo parts were customised according to the technical and expressive potential of the soloists who premiered and recorded them. I collaborated closely with the soloist in each case. - - The past four-year period has offered me a fascinating journey into new musical colours and the borderland between acoustic and amplified music – with all the possibilities and challenges that this entails.” Composer Olli Virtaperko has enjoyed a multi-faceted career. He studied composition, the Baroque cello and early music performance practice at the University of Edinburgh and at the Sibelius Academy, and on the other hand he was also a vocalist in one of Finland’s most popular rock groups, Ultra Bra. Virtaperko’s musical background feeds directly into his work as a composer, which includes heavy-duty solo concertos and orchestral works but also a number of works for Baroque and Renaissance period instruments and for his own early music group, Ensemble Ambrosius."

The fact, as J.M. Fischer writes in the booklet text, that the term “heroic baritone” has established itself in connection with these roles is recognition of the highly technical challenges- and simultaneously an understatement. The parallels with Wagner’s “heroic tenor roles” can be seen in the truly supreme vocal challenges, and yet the bass-baritone protagonist’s role in each of these works also demands even greater control of the dramatic character of the role and, therefore, a more complex musical approach. The enduring fascination of these demanding roles can also be sought in their “tragic awareness,” their undeniably “modern” broken state- something that is highly present in an era which sees itself as “post-heroic.” Michael Volle is the epitome of a singer who has almost untypically by today’s standard continuously grown into these roles and developed them in a serious way to bring out their individual characters.

At the age of 18, he sets off on his way through the Carpathian Mountains to Spisz (located in the north-east of present-day Slovakia). Throughout the following years, he works as a mercenary for various armies, once as an army drummer, then as a bugler in the war of Hungary against the Turks. Finally, he reaches Constantinople in the company of a “high-born lord”. In his Musicalisch-Turckischer Eulen-Spiegel, Speer sets texts from his picaresque novel Ungarischer oder Dacianischer Simplicissimus in music. Spear lets his hero Lompyn travel musically through all the countries then affected by the Turkish invasion. To this effect, the versatile composer created dances and melodies in the style of each of these almost exotic peoples. From the large number of stories, Gunar Letzbor, the leader of Ars antiqua Austria, chose two album-filling programs: the already released album with War Stories (PC 10317) of our hero Lompyn and now his Love Affairs. These are erotic accounts from the past that provide a certain antithesis to the war stories. In Love Affairs, we witness a few spicy scenes illustrating how little the world of love has changed its face over the centuries. The erotic allusions titillate today as they did then."

While the three composers’ initial intention appears to have been a descriptive one, the aesthetic aim clearly goes far beyond the mere imitation or recreation in sound of a landscape or a scene. For the composer, it is a question of sublimating the impression received, while the interpreter embodies it in every sense; the performer paints a picture, immerses himself in it and imperceptibly becomes that picture.

The congress of these instruments with very different musical universes is a constituent and defining element of the Symphonie de Poche’s identity. This is also what confers on the works interpreted by the ensemble a special originality all their own. The art of arrangement, essential to building a repertoire for a group that does not have one, is at the heart of the project. Evolving along with the instrumental group, it is not just a matter of shrinking an orchestral work to fit a small number of musicians, but also of bringing new enlightenment. This approach enables a genuine espousal of the chosen repertoire; this is the great originality of the ensemble. In this way, the Symphonie de Poche proposes a fresh reading of symphonic repertoire works, aiming at bringing to life, indeed at creating anew, our admirable musical heritage."

For a work that was written during an unhappy period of his life, Beethoven’s second symphony nevertheless bristles with infectious humour and vitality. Its striking innovations startled contemporary audiences, from the imposing opening to the capricious scherzo and the witty, energetic finale, but Beethoven’s indebtedness to the classical symphonies of Haydn and Mozart are still quite apparent. Goethe described Beethoven’s turbulent fifth symphony as “very great, quite wild; it makes one fear that the house might fall down.” Its visceral energy is announced right from the start with its famous opening notes whose hammer blows drive the development of the symphony – from the dark, brooding drama of the opening movement to the spectacular and radiant outburst in the triumphant final movement. It’s one of Beethoven’s most riveting and compelling works and one of his deservedly most popular. These recordings form part of the acclaimed cycle of Beethoven symphonies Rafael Kubelik made for Deutsche Grammophon in the 1970s, each symphony performed by a different orchestra."

The clear answer is “No!”. In a splendidly moving new recording of Engelbert Humperdinck’s one-hit wonder Hansel and Gretel, Maestro Marek Janowski now introduces the perfect “gateway drug” to opera. The fairy-tale opera Hansel and Gretel is a perfect choice as the first joint trip to the opera for parents and children to enjoy. The story of the two children who lose their way in the forest and are ensnared by the evil witch is well-known. The plot reflects the age-old conflict between good and evil, and has a happy ending. Add to this Humperdinck’s magical music: poetically childlike and powerfully dramatic at the same time. In the score, Humperdinck’s close connection to Richard Wagner is always discernible. The composition oscillates between childlike simplicity and adult monumentality. To this day, Hansel and Gretel remains one of the most popular pieces in the German opera repertoire. One of the main reasons for this is certainly the seriousness with which Humperdinck approached the simple story. All emotions are truly felt: and this is obvious not only to a child, but also to any adult who has retained a childlike view of the world. Who better than Marek Janowski here as conductor? Not only does he clearly feel completely at home in this late-Romantic German repertoire, he has also already given benchmark-setting interpretations of these works in both the major concert halls and the most important opera-houses. At the head of “his” Radio Symphony Orchestra Berlin – which he previously led for 14 years, raising it to an outstanding level of playing – he takes the listeners into the forest-bird sound-world of this fairy-tale opera, at all times accompanied by a well-coordinated ensemble of singers."

Britten’s haunting and mesmerising violin concerto is considered one of the century’s finest. The three contrasting movements are replete with grand theatrical gestures, unabashed lyricism, and show-stopping pyrotechnics, and the work closes with an austere passacaglia of other-wordly beauty and power. Following the work’s enthusiastic reception at its premiere in 1940 at Carnegie Hall, Britten declared “So far, it is without question my best piece”. “Britten and Hindemith completed their concertos at about the same time,” writes Steinbacher, “both are absolutely bursting with emotional turmoil, persisting precariousness, and latent despair.” Steinbacher feels a particular affinity with the Hindemith concerto. “Every artist introduces his own life experiences and personal feelings into his interpretations ... with the Hindemith concerto, I have an extremely close, even private connection, as my father knew Hindemith rather well.”"

Formal criteria like repeating the exposition before the development in the outer movements, or Beethoven-like figurations in the second thematic block of the Andante, point to Classical influences, while in the development of the first movement, besides the classically-influenced motivic and thematic treatment, there are clearly Romantic tendencies recalling Schubert’s “Unfinished” Symphony and Weber’s opera Der Freischutz.

No, it truly is not. That is because the “undoubtedly most important singer- alongside Maria Callas and Enrico Caruso- of the twentieth century” (according to Die Welt newspaper) had originally forbidden a release of this live recording. The most likely reason is that this recording made on February 26, 1989 in the Deutsche Oper in Dusseldorf and featuring his fourth wife, soprano Julia Varady, born in 1941, included songs that the baritone, who was to retire from active performance in 1992, planned to record in the studio. There are therefore really no feasible artistic grounds why this splendid Lieder matinee performance to mark the tenth anniversary of the Robert Schumann Society should remain “unheard-of” on any sound carrier. And so these are Fischer- Dieskau/Varady gems which we can now enjoy long after the event. Even when it comes to the repertoire there are works rarely encountered. “Romantic Duets” may well sound like a run of the mill selection of this artform, yet the composers of the Romantic era whose works are represented here were far more productive when it came to solo Lieder."

The quartet notes that through studying these works the group was able to find their artistic voices both as individuals as well as an ensemble. Through listening to their performances, one can really get a sense of their personal connection to these pieces, and that reverence only helps to highlight the personal connection Shostakovich felt to these quartets as well. In fact, these three quartets are each written in honor of different person or group he felt a close connection to. Shostakovich’s Seventh Quartet was written in memory of his first wife, she had died suddenly from complications during an emergency surgery. He even goes so far as to write “To live for you! To die for you!” in his score; that anguish is abundantly clear through the complex and chromatic harmonies he brings forth. Altius’ blazing technical facilities in the allegretto is nothing short of awesome, and their careful balancing of Shostakovich’s dense harmonies makes even the strongest of dissonances ring sonorously. Written after reluctantly joining the Communist Party and in the midst of his first instance of debilitating muscle fatigue, Shostakovich dedicated the Eighth Quartet “to the victims of fascism and the war.” Whether this is a reference to the atrocities he experienced during World War II or an expression of his closeted dissent of his country’s regime, the brooding largo and visceral allegretto demonstrate that this quartet could be dedicated to victims anywhere. In this work, the group’s cohesion comes to the forefront; the way in which the group can achieve dynamic unity in every swell and change allows the atmospheres that Shostakovich intended to come vividly to life. Finally, the Ninth Quartet was written in dedication to his third wife and it’s clear this work is written with a much more hopeful tone than his other pieces. For instance, this quartet doesn’t end with a morendo like so many of his other works; in fact, the quartet ends with a luminous forte. Even within the first few measures, it’s clear the ensemble has taken the time to live within the work. Although contingent upon rhythmic accuracy, the group still allows each phrase to breathe, ebb, and flow; all within perfect unison of one another. In the following brisker movements, the group is still able to convey the passion and fervor this work emits, whether it be the softest sul tasto or strongest fortissimo."

Whether it is Spanish, Romanian or Hungarian ‘gypsy’ tunes that we hear, musicologists from each country tell us that we are, in fact, enjoying the country’s own folk-tunes through the distorting prism of gypsy players. Jewish Klezmer music is also conflated with gypsy music: one of the earliest famous gypsy players was in fact a Jewish fiddler. The Roma themselves were recently pinned down by DNA evidence to having originated as a low caste tribe of musicians from Northern India called the Doma or Rom. Since they first appeared in 14th century Hungary, they spread through Europe, becoming must-have players for village dances, for aristocrats and for the courts. Although written source material is by its very nature limited, the Uhrovska Collecion – a Slovakian fiddler’s songbook from 1730 – provided a starting point for this disc, out of which we have explored, speculated and re-imagined the multi-layered relationships between folk and court music."

Belgian organist, composer, conductor, and opera director Bernard Foccroulle performs these works beautifully. He is currently the director of the Theatre royal de la Monnaie."

He made talented contributions to every genre of vocal and instrumental music. In the domain of the fantasia for viols, he wrote for numerous combinations of between two and six instruments and elaborated endlessly inventive formal structures, in which traces of Italianism are by no means absent. L’Achéron offers us a wide selection from this repertory, which it has recorded on viols based on early seventeenth-century English models. The viols include a Consort Bass, a Lyra-Way Bass, two Tenors, and two Dessus. All of these instruments were manufactured between 2012 and 2017; they are strung with six strings and with equal tension. They have employed a violone for the pieces in which Orlando Gibbons calls for the use of Great Double Bass."

Alongside the numerous compositions for organ, piano and orchestra, Reger wrote a number of works for male choir that appeared as folk songs in several lieder collections between 1898 and 1900. To make these demanding pieces sound as light and graceful as Reger intended them to be, an excellent choir is required: The Ensemble Vocapella Limburg, led by Tristan Meister, is best suited to perfectly reproduce the spirit of these lieder.

The music of Viktor Ullmann, in contrast, opens a doorway to a new musical language. Framed by atonal phraseology and percussive effects on the piano, the composer (who was killed in Auschwitz in 1944) tells the story of Hafis: a drunkard who rejects everything that had once been meaningful to him for the sake of his love of an irresistibly beautiful woman.

I have therefore found a musical way of opening a spiritual door to the suites and added chorales to Suites 1, 3, and 5 in the mould of sounds from John Cage’s work One 8, chorales that in my opinion are definitely consistent with messages conveyed in the suites. I find that John Cage’s music shares similarities with Bach’s. His music allows for inner reflection, providing a contemplative point of calm. Cage said the purpose of music is “to cleanse the soul and bring it peace, thus making it amenable to divine influences”. My son Immanuel intones the chorales to this special music; each chorale is followed by two Bach suites."""

The first is the quality of the performances. These are top-level musicians bringing their same superlative artistry to Christmas favorites that they do to a Schubert quartet or Taverner score. The second is the sterling quality of the recording. If there is a sonic equivalent to sipping a hot toddy while curled up before a roaring fire, it is Sono Luminus’s peerless mixes and captures. Third–and in every way as essential as the previous two–this is a kaleidoscopic collection of styles and interpretations of beloved songs and carols that keeps one eager for the next number.

The complete recordings from these concerts - previously only available in two separate editions Sviatoslav Richter - The Complete Album Collection and Great Moments at Carnegie Hall - are gathered together for the first time in one collection of thirteen CDs in a slipcase box including a booklet with archival photos and a new essay by Carnegie Hall archivist Gino Francesconi; The October 1960 recitals originally appeared on mono LPs in the United States (Columbia Masterworks) and Japan (Sony). They did not last long in the catalog, however, and became highly sought-after collectors items. By contrast, RCAs complete stereo master tapes from the December 23rd and 26th concerts came to light after Richters death in 1997. The recordings reveal the unusual breadth of the pianists enormous repertoire, including such Richter benchmarks as the Prokofiev Sixth and Eighth Sonatas, Schumanns C Major Fantasie, Rachmanimov Preludes, Beethoven Sonatas, Scriabins Fifth Sonata, plus works by Haydn, Schumann and Debussy.

This is unquestionably the most comprehensive display of the legendary American conductor’s unparalleled dynamism and versatility ever offered in a single package. Many of Bernstein’s most memorable and critically acclaimed interpretations are brought together here for the first time. This has allowed for the creation of a natural balance (for example, between the orchestra and solo instruments) that brings the quality of these half-century-old recordings, excellent for their time, up to the discriminating standards of today’s audiophiles. In addition, there has been a meticulous restoration of some earlier masterings in which LP surface noise was too rigorously eliminated at the expense of the original brilliance. In every case, the masterings in this new collection represent the best ever issued of these matchless recordings by one of the greatest musicians of the last century.Space permits only the mention of highlights, but they will give you a sense of the breadth and depth of this astonishing new set. There are his two classic complete opera recordings with the Vienna Philharmonic: Verdi’s Falstaff (1966) starring Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau and Strauss’s Rosenkavalier (1971) with Christa Ludwig, Gwyneth Jones, Lucia Popp and Walter Berry. And his incandescent complete 1966 Haydn Creation from New York. Bernstein’s New York Philharmonic recordings that launched the “Mahler Renaissance” in the 1960s are here, of course, including the 1961 Third Symphony which has arguably never been surpassed. Ditto for Carl Nielsen, whose great works Bernstein brought to a wide new public with interpretations like the 1962 NYP recording of the Fifth Symphony, perhaps the most thrilling account of this 20th-century masterpiece ever committed to disc. The Sibelius Fifth recording from 1961 is another celebrated Bernstein reading. And while we’re talking about Fifth Symphonies, Bernstein’s Beethoven Fifth from 1961 is still as electrifying now as it was then. His talk about the work is also included, one of many treasurable spoken-word commentaries in this set delivered by one of classical music’s most charismatic and influential lecturers and teachers.Naturally there’s much more Mahler, Nielsen, Sibelius and Beethoven in the new collection, not to mention Bach and Vivaldi, Haydn and Mozart, Schubert and Schumann, Berlioz and Liszt, Brahms and Bruckner, Dvorák and Smetana, Bizet and Offenbach, Tchaikovsky and Rachmaninoff, Saint-Saëns and Poulenc, Grieg and Fauré, Stravinsky and Hindemith, Bartók and Berg, Ives and Copland, Prokofiev and Shostakovich, Richard and Johann Strauss – symphonies, overtures, symphonic poems, dances, choral and vocal works as well as countless great concertos with soloists like Isaac Stern and Glenn Gould, not to mention Bernstein himself in Gershwin’s Rhapsody in Blue.Bernstein the composer is also represented by all his ballets, symphonies, concertos and more. The original Broadway cast recording of Candide from 1956 is included, as is the definitive version of his most famous work, the original Broadway cast recording of West Side Story from 1957 – plus Bernstein’s later recording of the musical’s “Symphonic Dances”.   There is, of course, the still astonishing album that launched Leonard Bernstein’s international reputation as the most dynamic and charismatic conductor of his era, Stravinsky’s Rite of Spring recorded in January 1958 – two months after his appointment as the youngest music director in the New York Philharmonic’s history. And, as a special bonus, there is his debut with the Philharmonic, from the radio broadcast of November 11, 1943, when he made music history stepping in for Bruno Walter and setting the musical world abuzz."

""Die schöne Mullerin"" has always been seen as the most important lieder cycle because of its full-lenght narrative dimension based on a popular and rather simple story: a disillusioned love between a miller's daughter and a young miller's apprentice. With this new recording of ""Die schöne Mullerin"" including five poems, not set to music by Schubert, in the form of recitations, Gerhaher turns Schubert's famous song cycle with new insights and a new approach: By including Muller's Prolog, Epilog and three other poems: Das Muhlenleben, Erster Schmerz, letzter Scherz and Blumlein Vergissmein, Gerhaher showcases the complexity of Wilhelm Muller's poetry. The five additional poems depict a complex psychological portrait of the miller's apprentice: the story of a young man who loves the idea of being in love more than love itself and his psychological introspection leading to delusional perceptions. Thanks to Gerhaher's inclusion of the five poems, the cycle acquires a greater dramaturgical significance opening up a space to new interpretations of ""Die schöne Mullerin"". Christian Gerhaher gives insights of his new interpretation in the booklet he wrote especially for this release."

There are two arias from the late masterpiece La clemenza di Tito: ‘Del più sublime soglio’ and the anguished ‘Se all’impero’. Both tenor arias - ‘Dalla sua pace’ and ‘Il mio tesoro’ – from Don Giovanni are present too, as is the hauntingly beautiful ‘Un’aura amorosa’ from Così fan tutte. Mozart also features arias from earlier operas, including the dazzlingly virtuosic ‘Si spande al sole in faccia’ from Il re pastore, and the infectious ‘Fuor del mar’ from Idomeneo. From Die Entführung aus dem Serail is the lovely ‘Ich baue ganz auf deine Stärke’, full of amorous hopefulness, and from Mitridate, re di Ponto, composed when Mozart was just fourteen, is the fast and furious ‘Vado incontro’.

There was a time when the best-loved opera by a Czech composer – aside from Smetana’s Bartered Bride, which it much resembles – was Schwanda the Bagpiper by Jaromír Weinberger. After its triumphant premiere in Prague in 1927, it immediately went on to conquer audiences from Helsinki to Buenos Aires.

The film will feature recently rediscovered archived film from Goodall's research in Tanzania's Gombe Stream National Park in the 1960s. Goodall’s field research at Gombe transformed our understanding of chimpanzees and redefined the relationship between humans and animals in ways that continue to emanate around the world.  About the Music: Through his operas, his symphonies, his compositions for his own ensemble, and his wide-ranging collaborations with artists ranging from Twyla Tharp to Allen Ginsberg, Woody Allen to David Bowie, Philip Glass has had an extraordinary and unprecedented impact upon the musical and intellectual life of his times. The operas Einstein on the Beach, Satyagraha, Akhnaten, and The Voyage, among many others play throughout the world’s leading houses, and rarely to an empty seat. Glass has written music for experimental theater and for Academy Award®-winning motion pictures such as The Hours and Martin Scorsese’s Kundun, while Koyaanisqatsi, his initial filmic landscape with Godfrey Reggio and the Philip Glass Ensemble, may be the most radical and influential mating of sound and vision since Fantasia. His associations, personal and professional, with leading rock, pop and world music artists date back to the 1960s, including the beginning of his collaborative relationship with artist Robert Wilson. Indeed, Glass is the first composer to win a wide, multi-generational audience in the opera house, the concert hall, the dance world, in film and in popular music simultaneously."

Boasting guitar work likely influenced by performers such as Funkadelic and Curtis Mayfield, their sound was contemporarily funky, and the subject matter of their songs showed the traditional gospel religious roots of its members. As Dean Rudland's historical liner notes to the 2010 CD reissue on Beat Goes Public rightly observe, it is an ""album filled with funk and soul with a gospel edge, rather than the other way around."" At its core, it's an engaging blend of gospel and the smoldering funk that was fast becoming a big soul trend in the early '70s, especially in the standout cut, ""Son of the Deacon,"" a slow groover powered by a moody, fuzzed-out guitar riff and sultry female backup vocals. Don’t be fooled by the down-and-out vibe of the album cover – between the sweet-soul tinged vocal harmonies and the wah-wah-laced grooves, the Sons of Truth cover all the bases, turning in a well-rounded set of uplifting soul music no matter how you slice it. A1.

This survey of sacred songs and hymns by Gustav Holst, his pupil Edmund Rubbra, and his lifelong friend and colleague Ralph Vaughan Williams, visits the melodic and sacred themes that are common among the three composers. It devotes particular attention to Rubbra’s songs, which are less well known than many by his two senior colleagues. Edmund Rubbra’s writing draws from the modal harmonies of early sacred music and Celtic folk traditions. In addition to several songs by Rubbra, O Gladsome Light also includes Variations on a Phrygian Theme for solo violin and Meditations on a Byzantine Hymn for solo viola, two works that highlight the composers’ lyrical, modal style and feature the soloists Marie Bérard and Keith Hamm. Paired with Rubbra are the Holst Four Songs for voice and violin and the Vaughan Williams Four Hymns for tenor, viola and piano producing a meditative and musically satisfying program of sacred music that can be listened to during Christmas, Lent and throughout the year."

Together they let the music roll along like a well-oiled freight train, through rockers and ballads, be they originals or standards. The Dane Troels Jensen started out as a cornetist in a New Orleans band, then moved on to bluegrass, country and western. With his bottleneck guitar in hand, he was spotted by legendary blues and gospel singer and guitarist Sister Rosetta Tharpe. She spurred him to follow her way, which he did as a vocalist, pianist and guitarist in the Delta Blues Band, a mainstay on the European scene for half a century. Miriam Mandipira was born and grew up in Zimbabwe. As a small girl, she became interested in music and through television, she became smitten by blues, gospel, jazz and soul. She studied classical music, lieder and musicals at school and became well versed in technique and performance. Before her graduation she had to make a choice, and returned to her first love in music, the one that had grabbed her emotions. Professionally, she sang jazz and blues in Zimbabwe, then Africa, before she reached Denmark ten years ago. Her voice carries the legacy of the greatest singers of jazz and soul like Billie Holiday, Etta James and Aretha Franklin. Mandipira and Jensen has performed together on numerous occasions to great critical acclaim. Their new project My Love promises to bring together the best from the jazz and soul tradition with a lively, modern spirit produced by a large band where each member gives their all to the music."

The recordings on this release are chosen from three terrific evenings at Montmartre in February 2016. Christian Brorsen, Music Director at Montmartre 2011-2016, says: “Dexter Gordon said it himself when he returned to the United States after 14 years in Copenhagen: “I miss the American drummers.” If you have been lucky enough to experience one of them live, you know why. Among the masterful drummers who have visited Montmartre in the course of time, we find the likes of Art Blakey, Art Taylor, Ed Thigpen and Billy Higgins. Rodney Green belongs to a new generation of great drummers. Brought up by elite musicians such as Mulgrew Miller and Charlie Haden, he knows something about the nature of jazz and what it takes to perform on a level so few others are capable of. Rodney’s got it all: good taste, a dazzling technique, and a formidable beat”. For Rodney Green, the music always comes first. It all looks so simple when he’s sitting there, behind the drum set. There’s no showing off, but it always sounds incredibly good, so there’s a good reason why he is so much in demand. Simplicity and authenticity also underpinned these three terrific evenings at Montmartre, where he was asked to put together a quartet of musicians who, like himself, are capable of being present in the moment, doing away with long rehearsals. “As far as I’m concerned, real jazz musicians must be able to meet and play without discussions or long rehearsals, and just let their instruments speak,” says Green. And that is how these sessions unfolded at Montmartre, to the delight of an enthusiastic audience who couldn’t get enough of this ardent quartet of musicians that, besides Rodney Green, comprised Danish pianist Jacob Christoffersen and American bassist David Wong. Together the three laid a hard-swinging foundation for Warren Wolf´, also from the U.S. and possibly the greatest vibraphone virtuoso ever."

Music for solo flute-micro-music that is gigantic in its naked fragility, made for and with an instrument that lives on breath, al fiato. But this is also a voyage through; an untangling of ardous, delicate, brutal, yet innocent compositions-the experience of interpreting a new repertoire, including some newborn pieces. The idea of provoking-rather than passively awaiting-an evolution, a path reconnoiter, a future in which to project oneself without fear. All of the works on this disk have been premiered by me except for those by José Luis TorA and Alberto Posadas, with whom I had the honor of working very closely.

In particular, Souvenir (1968) and Orts (or Souvenir n.2, 1969) are twin works can be ascribed to the so-called negative period, while Abyss (1983) and Puppenspiel 3 (1994) are two diffrent cases, linked to a phase of renewed confidence in artisanal creativeness, as well as a deep exploration of instrumental dramaturgy. In speak of artisan quality is doubtless reductive in regard to similar extraordinarily and inventive sonorous devices. They are compositions generated by combinatory automatisms and processes of syntactic proliferation of interval structures, mixed and animated by a particular creative imagination. Perhaps the self-generative aspect of Donatoni's compositions has been excessively placed in the centre of his musical research and his extraordinary constructive ability as a synonym of cold indifference of access codes, faced with an idiomatic and consistent style, with unpredictable but always recognisable results. The auto-analysis of the constructive and deconstructive procedures, which can be found in important writings like Questo, Antecedente X or Il sigaro di Armando, is one of the elements that are intertwined whit Donatoni's methodical rigour and his work as an artist, both personal and ineffabile."

It was also a period for sadness at the death of his first wife, Maria Barbara, in 1720, and happiness at his marriage to Anna Magdalena in 1721. For this event, Bach compiled a little notebook of harpsichord music as a wedding gift, and amongst the pieces found there are the four suits recorded here. Many years after Bach's death, Friedrich Wilhelm Marpung added two suites from a later notebook to from what he called the six 'French Suites', but the music is not, in fact, particulary in the French style, and this designation was never intended the composer.

Antonín Dvorák composed his Piano Quintet No. 2 while staying at his beloved summer house in Vysoká in the late summer of 1887. The renowned critic Eduard Hanslick responded to its performance in Vienna enthusiastically: ""It is one of his most beautiful works. A genuine Dvorák.“ The String Quintet op. 97, albeit only six years younger, presents a completely ""different Dvorák“. After the Symphony from the New World and the “American” quartet, the string quintet is the composer’s third work written in America. Besides drawing inspiration from the music of the Native American tribe of the Iroquois which he heard in Spillville in the summer of 1893, he built the third movement around a theme that he had previously considered using in a proposal for a new American anthem. And Hanslick’s testimonial? ""This is probably the simplest, most natural and happiest music composed since Haydn’s times. The ear enjoys it with an easy-going attitude and the spirit is not bored for a single moment.“ Pavel Haas Quartet is at home in Dvorák’s music – to quote the Sunday Times, ""In this repertoire, they are simply matchless today.“"

They are the questions of friendship, love and death. In the epic of Gilgamesh, we encounter a very acute and almost anxiously distressful yearning to find the answers, which we have been seeking in vain to the present day.” The music Martinu created during the last decade of his life demonstrates his penchant for religious and spiritual texts. The idea of setting the epic written 4,500 years ago matured in the composer for 15 years. Although differing boldly from the avant-garde of the 1950s, it is an utterly modern piece, reflecting Martinu’s intense interest in Baroque music and the Notre Dame school. The oratorio, premiered on 23 January 1958 in Basel, was a tremendous success. Its performance in Prague in January 2017 by the Czech Philharmonic and a superb international team of soloists, conducted by Manfred Honeck, brought back to life the work’s English version, based on Reginald Campbell Thompson’s translation.

If he is talented, he allows us to glimpse the essence of the work that is in itself a thing of genius and that is reflected through him.

Here he uses the full resources of the symphony orchestra in a number of powerful and dramatic works, including two movements from a symphony that he later withdrew and an orchestration of Liszt’s Funerailles. A lighter bonne bouche-the Dances from the Matra, rather like Kodaly’s Dances from Galanta- rounds things off.

In this edition, four distinctly different pieces reflect four completely different attempts to deal with emotional or audible silence, giving us a glimpse behind the “continuum” that surrounds us. As John Cage stated, “times have changed; music has changed”. It will never stop doing so.

A particular atmosphere is especially noticeable in these settings, to which Killmayer has devoted three groups of works of Friedrich Hölderlin. In general, Killmayer succeeded in finding a unique aura of sound for his almost complete setting of the poems, a sound quality that is entirely appropriate for this simple and hermetic poetry. In Killmayer’s two song cycles based on poems by Georg Trakl there is also a musical lyricism growing out of a profound and intense understanding of the text. In a manner appropriate to the poet’s tone of voice, Killmayer’s settings employ a richly varied sound texture to attain a deeper psychological perspective, something that Trakl’s poetry has in common with Hölderlin’s.

I was given the opportunity to record my first CD, Godson, on the Japanese label King Records. Sonny suggested the title Godson because it explained his and my dad’s Hope. The Godson CD featured Al Foster, Rufus Reid and Mark Soskin, all members of Sonny’s bands."" Look to the Sky, Wyatt’s debut for Whaling City Sound and his sixth recording overall, is magnificently realized, both instrumentally and emotionally. There are musical nods to his father (“Jolley Charlie”) and mother (“Psalm for Phennie”), to Coltrane (“My Favorite Things”) and a few other intimate touchpoints, some original, a few written by his accompanist, Benito Gonzalez. Indeed, Wyatt is joined here by excellent progressive musicians, including the resounding pianist Gonzalez, drummers Shinnosuke Takahashi and Kyle Pool, Eric Wheeler on bass and Keyon Harrold on trumpet. Together, their music is filled with hope and dedication, reciprocity and passion. With every recording, Wyatt flourishes, in terms of artistry and intensity, power and finesse. Look to the Sky is the man’s—and his band’s— finest and fullest record yet."
VSO         ,WIENER SYMPHONIKER,WS013,4260313960132,"Wiener Symphoniker; Jordan, Philippe","Beethoven, Ludwig van",Beethoven: Symphonies Nos. 1 & 3,COMPACT DISC,1,14.81,22.99,2017,"The Wiener Symphoniker wrote music history with the first performances of works by Bruckner, Ravel and Schoenberg. And under the baton of such illustrious music directors as Wilhelm Furtwängler, Herbert von Karajan, Carlo Maria Giulini or Georges Prêtre they acquired worldwide fame for their unique Viennese sound. Considering its rich, more than a century long history, it comes as a surprise that the orchestra has never before recorded a full cycle of the nine symphonies by Ludwig van Beethoven which are widely considered to constitute the apex of the symphonic repertoire. This shortcoming is about to be remedied: Starting in autumn 2017, the Wiener Symphoniker will release the full cycle on 5 albumss. With a new album of the series to be released every 6 months, the full cycle will be completed just in time for the 250th anniversary of the birth of Beethoven in 2020. The symphonies were recorded live during a critically acclaimed concert cycle in Spring/Summer 2017 in the Great Hall of the Musikverein Wien. At these concerts, the international press specifically praised Jordan’s approach to combining a traditional Viennese sound with a more contemporary, slimmed down interpretation of the material, original tempi and insights from the historically informed performance practice. Through a close reading of the score and by focusing on the content of the works, Jordan aimed to create – in his words – a “more natural, direct, humanised“ image of the famous composer."
WIN         ,WINTER & WINTER GmbH,910242-2,25091024223,Arditti String Quartet,"Abrahamsen, Hans",Hans Abrahamsen: String Quartets Nos. 1-4,COMPACT DISC,1,14.81,22.99,2017,"Some composers identify early on with a particular genre. A quick glance at a list of works by the Dane Hans Abrahamsen seems to indicate a very different attitude. The profusion of titles suggests a mind that picks up a form, engages with it for the duration of the work itself, and then moves on to something fresh. There has been one significant exception however- the string quartet. Abrahamsen’s four quartets span almost the whole of his composing career: Quartet No. 1 was composed in 1973, when Abrahamsen was in his early twenties; Quartet No. 4 appeared in 2012, as he entered his sixties. Not only so, but the quartets also draw a vital thread across the chasm at the heart of his life’s work. This new release presents the aforementioned works as well as the two quartets that appeared between them, brilliantly performed by the Arditti String Quartet."

We love Yuko’s sense of rhythm and melody, and her improvising feels like she was born in Detroit or New York City. Her technique reminds one of some of Yuko’s music idols like Oscar Peterson, Herbie Hancock and Monty Alexander. But beyond her talent for traditional jazz, one can also hear flavors of American R&B, Hip-Hop and Blues, which Yuko loved as a teenager. This album’s associate producer and Yarlung special advisor Billy Mitchell describes Yuko’s playing as “funky from the heart,” and he means that as an enormous compliment. Yuko was born in Fukui, on the west coast of Japan, north of Kyoto. She studied classical music and the piano starting at age four, and continued her studies at the AN Music School in Kyoto, where she was a jazz piano student of Kunihiro Kameda. Yarlung first heard the Yuko Mabuchi Trio at Catalina Bar and Grill in Hollywood and offered to record their debut album the next day. This live concert recording session took place in Cammilleri Hall, the same concert venue designed by Yasuhisa Toyota, where Yarlung recorded Sophisticated Lady jazz quartet in 2014. Jazz pianist and educator Billy Mitchell served as associate producer."

Before that – during the interwar years – he conducted many orchestras all over Europe. Living in New York from 1919-1924 he was first conductor to the New York City Symphony Orchestra and guest conductor to the New York Philharmonic. He also was co-founder and first conductor of the American Orchestral Society. In 1924 Richard Strauss requested him to work as first director of the Wiener Konzertverein, where he performed with Igor Strawinsky. From the thirties - while living in Paris - he focused on composing. In 1939 Fock moved back to New York. His patriotic song cycle Songs of Glory (1945) on texts by Joseph Auslander – then Poet Laureate of the United States – is inspired by the events of World War II. This cycle had several performances in the United States with Todd Duncan, the first Afro-American opera singer of the New York City Opera. Fock died in 1973 while living in Switzerland; he left behind a small but extraordinary body of work which expresses his love of the human voice."
