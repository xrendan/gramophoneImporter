With this edition Sigiswald Kuijken and his ensemble La Petite Bande want to strengthen this new approach and prove it right by their excellent performances. The project of recording one cantata composed for each Sunday and high feast of the liturgical year has been spread over several concert seasons, during each of which three to four cantatas were given concert performances and were recorded. As far as possible this was made during the releant time of the year for which the cantatas were written. ""Among current cantata series Sigiswald Kuijken‘s has a distinctive place, his one-to-a-part voices and few instruments achieving striking delicacy.

And, for the one hundred schoolchildren who delved into Bach‘s monumental work and learned to dance as an artistic form of self-expression, it was an opportunity to experience the power of his music first hand. The interplay of professional musicians and young amateurs turned into a creative bridge for all involved. By deciding to have its own baroque orchestra and a choir formed of singers with practical, performing criteria in mind, the Bachakademie is forging a new path. The basic kind of sound, and at the same time the unique international selling point of this new approach underlies the Bachakademie’s decision to commission a historical replica of a chamber organ by the legendary organ builder and contemporary of Bach, Gottfried Silbermann. An original instrument by him has recently been discovered in Seerhausen, Saxony. As an example of the baroque sound, true to the original, this replica embodies the approach at the very heart of a Bachakademie of the future. The newly-founded baroque orchestra and the newly-constituted choir of the Bachakademie will perform under the joint name GAECHINGER CANTOREY from now onwards. Based on the historic foundations of the Bach era, and with roots in the living performance history of the choir founded by Helmuth Rilling, this name represents an integrated musical approach and the aesthetic sound ideal of the baroque."

The two eras are not placed in opposition for this concert, as Michael Nyman’s music arises naturally from that of his predecessors; on the contrary, it is a clever mix of genres that points out to surprising similarities between these works: we could easily believe that Tye’s ‘Sit Fast’ was composed very recently.

He asked them to return the next day and duly noted five tunes. His lifelong enthusiasm for folk song had begun. The revelatory moment for Vaughan Williams had come on December 4, 1903 when he heard the shepherd, Charles Potiphar, sing Bushes and Briars at Ingrave, near Brentwood, Essex. As Vaughan Williams put it: “I knew and loved the few English folk songs which were then available in printed collections, but I only believed in them vaguely… my faith was not yet active.” Hearing Bushes and Briars “set all my doubts about folk song at rest” and Vaughan Williams’ musical style was to change forever. I Love My Love is a collection of remastered 78 rpm recordings of folk songs.

It wasn’t easy to make a representative selection as there really is a lot to choose from!

Berlioz praised the orchestra, when he appeared with it as conductor, and in the 1880s Stuttgart was one of the first to stage the complete Ring cycle, conducted by the then general music director Herman Zumpe, who had assisted Wagner at the first Bayreuth Festival. The tradition of first performances has included the première of Strauss’s Ariadne auf Naxos in 1912, conducted by the composer, in 1921 of a one-acter by Hindemith, and in recent times works by Orff, Penderecki, Glass, Zender, Riehm and Hölszky. Lothar Zagrosek took over the helm of the orchestra in 1997, and has been responsible for a number of important and innovative performances.

Presented as a world premiere in February 2017 in Buffalo, where it was performed by Alain Lefevre and the Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra under the direction of the renowned JoAnn Falletta, the reconstituted Concerto No. 3 was enthusiastically received by the audience. Recorded at those performances, the album Andre Mathieu: Concerto No. 3 accurately conveys the brilliance of Alain Lefevre and the enthusiasm of the musicians, aware as they were of sharing a highly emotional and one-of-a-kind moment. JoAnn Falletta had previously collaborated with Alain Lefevre in presenting works by Mathieu – in New York’s Carnegie Hall in 2013, among other settings. It was in the fall of 1942, 75 years ago, that young Quebec prodigy Andre Mathieu, just 13 years old and at the peak of his glory, began writing his Concerto No. 3, which he would finish the following summer. In 2008, George Nicholson discovered the original score of Andre Mathieu’s Concerto No. 3 written in the Quebec composer’s own hand. The differences, which were noteworthy, between this original score and the Concerto de Quebec, the well-known, modified, version of the work, were the starting point for an enormous undertaking aimed at restoring this masterwork of Mathieu’s. The new album also contains George Gershwin’s An American in Paris. Commissioned by the New York Philharmonic and premiered in 1928, the work translates into music the vivid impressions of an American visiting Paris, strolling the city streets and soaking up the exuberant atmosphere of the French capital."

The village music in the main is melodic, with songs and dances accompanied by woodwind and stringed instruments, as well as drums and metal percussion instruments for providing the rhythm. The piphat band, on the other hand, employs a rich collection of percussion instruments belonging to the metallophone and the xylophone families and played with drums, gongs, and cymbals. These are divided into two sections, one providing a melody and the other the rhythm. Sometimes the orchestra is led by a single woodwind instrument, the pi nai, which belongs to the oboe family, like the Indian shehnai. The music is played in a diatonic scale with seven equidistant notes but without any semitones between the steps of the octave.

The three composers are representative of as many generations of an industrious dynasty: Francesco Feo (1691-1761) was the uncle of Gennaro Manna (1715-79), who in turn was the uncle of Gaetano (1751-1804). Comparison between their scores allows us to observe the extraordinary development from the austerity of the late Baroque to the elegance of the galant style. The Lamentations by the two Mannas were part of the liturgy of Holy Thursday (Officium tenebrarum), whereas Feo’s La sinderesi, a sorrowful meditation on sin and contrition, belongs to the form of the spiritual cantata and points to a private devotional environment. The short and bright Gloria by Gennaro Manna crowns the programme, symbolising the final achievement of a dimension of redemption and eternal salvation. All the pieces are characterised by the typically Neapolitan taste for purity of voice, with restrained virtuosity and radiant expressivity.

The Brandenburg Concerto No. 5 was the first in the history of the keyboard concerto to contain an extended solo part for the harpsichord. In the harpsichord concertos that followed soon after, the keyboard instrument fully established its leading role. Meanwhile, manuscript studies have shown that Bach’s harpsichord concertos are derived from earlier concertos for other instruments. Felix Mendelssohn’s Double Concerto for Violin, Piano, and Strings in d minor shares certain similarities with Bach’s keyboard concertos, both in terms of its sparkling effervescence and youthful exuberance, but also in the many contrapuntal passages with which the young composer sought to demonstrate his capabilities. At the same time, Mendelssohn also sought to pay homage to “the Father of Western music.” It is widely known that he played a critical role in Bach’s rediscovery; Mendelssohn’s revival of the St. Matthew Passion helped to restore Bach’s rightful place in the history of music. Pianist Sabine Weyer performs regularly throughout Europe as an orchestra soloist and a recitalist. In 2016 she joined the faculty of the Music Conservatory of the City of Luxembourg.

It seems almost incomprehensible that Chopin was able to write rich, dramatic works of this magnitude during periods of intense suffering. Kotaro Fukuma’s concept for this recording was a juxtaposition of two life cycles: the first cycle consists of the Preludes paired with the Berceuse, which appear to symbolize the ascent to heaven; the Contredanse marks the beginning of a new section, of a second cycle, which comes to a triumphant conclusion with the Finale of the B minor Sonata.

One of these things is certainly Franz Schubert’s magnificent Piano Trio in E flat major D. 929, which is one reason why this new recording by the Trio Alba is very much welcome. The Notturno D. 897 composed at about the same time as the trio and forming the perfect conclusion to this album may have been a discarded slow movement for another trio. It was not until the end of his short life that Schubert found his way to the piano trio. His two great contributions to this genre represent the culmination of the whole of his compositional mastery. During the course of the gigantically dimensioned E flat major trio he successfully forms a cyclical design attesting to razor-sharp discernment and phenomenal structuring talent. The work was first performed during one of the last “Schubertiade” private concerts held as a benefit event for Schubert. The composer did not live to read the rave review in the Allgemeine Musikalische Zeitung of Leipzig. The musicians of Trio Alba met while studying together in Graz and ever since then have regularly concertized at leading festivals throughout the world. The ensemble has a very special relationship with Schubert’s E flat major trio: “If you see the sun setting” is the first line of the Swedish folk song in the second movement- which inspires even more joyful anticipation of the dawn, “alba” in Italian!"

The finale of the ""Gassenhauer"" Trio, which was composed in 1797, draws on a popular Singspiel melody by the composer Josef Weigl whose cheerful naivete is very well-suited to the character of the (B-flat) clarinet; the dimensions and ambitious scope of the work, however, make it a truly ""classical"" piano trio. Sometimes referred to as the ""eighth"" trio, the Piano Trio in E-flat major, Op. 38 for violin or clarinet, cello, and piano, which Beethoven published in 1807 under the title ""Grand Trio,"" is an arrangement of the Septet, Op. 20 written in 1799-1800. Beethoven presented the Septet in April 1800, along with the First Symphony, at an Academy in Vienna, where it met with enthusiastic acclaim. Beethoven brilliantly solved the problem of scoring the piece for piano trio while preserving its sound character, without sacrificing the principle of ""obligato accompaniment,"" the independence of each voice irrespective of its function. Finally, the Trio Movement in E-flat major dates back to the composer's younger years; he wrote the piece in 1790 for the members of the so-called Zehrgarten club, before later setting out for Vienna in 1792."

It is hard to apply the usual musicological jargon to Ustvolskaya’s music. She was not the apocalypse of the 20th century- she was its echo. Thanks to providence, she was never sent to one of Stalin’s concentration camps: destiny allowed her to live in seclusion as an artist never blinded by hopes of success. In choosing solitude, she was by no means a Romantic “hero” fleeing from reality, overtly proud of fulfilling a mission or playing an exclusive role. Her seclusion, instead, was the bitter loneliness of a noble soul trembling in view of the world’s utter imperfection. She mourns for it. She prays for us. Ustvolskaya chose to live the life of a hermit. Contact with other human beings was something she often found difficult- even with musicians who really liked her. As she put it herself: “My sincerest wish would be to crawl into a barrel like Diogenes and just live secluded therein. That would be the best option for my life…”"

Our seven-league-boot journey across the realm of fugue begins with the two earliest published German works in the genre for instrumental ensemble from the year 1602. The first of them has ethereal motifs which it rather cautiously explores, whereas the second is based on the folk song O Nachbar Roland, mein Herz ist voller Pein (which Samuel Scheidt arranged as a magnificent canzone for strings in 1621). Haussmann’s Fugae are written “for all kinds of instruments”: idiomatic passagework for violin is thus entirely absent here, and only emerged as a stylistic trait in the course of the 17th century. Alessandro Scarlatti is the composer of four sonatas that are to be performed senza cembalo, as he specifies, and which are often referred to as the first string quartets. The animated movements are complex counterpoint constructions; the middle movements are tortuous harmonic meanders brimming with ligature et durezze; the final movements are all short, ironic minuets with the two violin parts in unison."

Here one will not yet find innovative writing of the caliber of what Mendelssohn would soon produce in the Octet or in the Overture to “A Midsummer Night’s Dream.” Louis Spohr and Hummel still hold sway as conventional musical models, but at least the agile Menuetto exudes Mendelssohnian flair, rushing on by with the grace of a fairy. The work was not printed until 1868, twenty-one years after Mendelssohn’s death, and has not circulated widely since then. Mendelssohn biographer Eric Werner described this work as a “miniature chamber concerto for the piano, contrasting the latter with the five other instruments. Along with Witold Lutosawski, Krzysztof Penderecki is regarded as the most outstanding Polish composer of the twentieth century. Starting in the 1980s, Penderecki abandoned all avant-garde tendencies and has been increasingly using the music of the 19th and early 20th centuries as his models. With a generous playing time of 35 minutes, the work presents itself as a reminiscence of great Slavic composers of the 20th century. Here one can easily detect Penderecki’s penchant for Stravinsky, even more so for Bartok and, above all, for Shostakovich. As Penderecki once put it himself: “I am, of course, a Slavic composer who is mainly interested in communicating his emotions through musical expression.”"

Arnold Schoenberg and Paul Hindemith were both at the avant-garde epicentre of the 1910s and 1920s, but their future paths could hardly have been more different. Whereas Schoenberg would go on to have a decisive influence on twentieth-century modernism with his dodecaphonic music and the Second Viennese School, Paul Hindemith gradually renounced his rebellious early music, eventually becoming something of an anachronistic loner. The relatively early String Trio No. 1 (1924) already betrays the composer's interest in the forms and textures of baroque music. It opens with a flittering Toccata, going on to offer a contrapuntal web in its slow movement and ends with a double fugue. The contrapuntal textures are present also in the Second String Trio, but the neotonal language and general atmosphere point forward to later, large-scale works such as Mathis der Mahler. In 1933, the year Hindemith composed his second trio, the political developments in Germany caused Arnold Schoenberg to leave Europe for the U.S.A. (Hindemith would follow in 1940.) It took him considerable time before he found his feet in this new environment and continuing financial and professional worries probably contributed to a serious heart attack that struck him down in August 1946. The String Trio, Op.45, begun shortly before the heart attack and completed a month after it, is the disturbing expression of this extreme near-death experience. It also presents one of the greatest challenges in the entire string repertoire – in fact Schoenberg considered easing the technical difficulties by expanding the trio into a quintet."

Aimed at ‘Connaisseurs and Amateurs’, the first collection was a retrospective selection of six sonatas but when this became a commercial success Bach expanded and varied the scheme, adding rondos (a recently popular form) for the second and third collection and, in the final three collections, samples of his free fantasies. On the previous two discs in his acclaimed series, Miklós SpAnyi combined pieces from Collection 1 and 2, performing them on the clavichord (Volume 31) and the tangent piano (Volume 32). For the present disc, SpAnyi has chosen to remain with the tangent piano, an early form of the piano with strings that are struck by small wooden slips (‘tangents’). The basic sound of the instrument is reminiscent of the harpsichord, but this can be modified in a number of ways through the use of various devices. In Collection 3, Bach provided variety by alternating previously composed sonatas with newly written rondos and Miklós SpAnyi adds to this by appending an independent set of variations to the collection. Probably intended for amateur keyboard players, the Canzonetta with 6 Variations was composed in 1781, and described by Bach in the catalogue of his works as ‘Canzonetta by the Duchess of Gotha with my 6 variations’."

Published in 1920, at the composer’s own expense, it contains radical experiments in harmony and rhythm and would have to wait until 1939 for its first public performance. In the course of its four movements, Ives depicts some of the famous inhabitants of the small town of Concord in Massachusetts, a centre of the mid-19th century transcendentalism movement. Luminaries of the movement such as Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry David Thoreau are alluded to in various ways in music that includes references to Beethoven, religious and patriotic hymns and circus marches, as well as brief ‘guest appearances’ by a viola and a flute. Lasting 47 minutes on the present recording, it is a massive work of a staggering complexity, and a true challenge for any performer – a challenge more than readily accepted by the young Finnish pianist Joonas Ahonen, who has previously recorded Ligeti’s piano concerto for BIS. For the opening work on the disc, the much shorter Violin Sonata No.4, Ahonen is joined by his compatriot, the celebrated violinist Pekka Kuusisto. Composed during the same period as the Concord Sonata, this piece also has an extra-musical background, namely the composer’s memories as a child of the so-called camp meetings held during the Christian revivalism of the late 19th century."

Some 20 years earlier John Dowland, melancholic par excellence, had expressed a similar idea in the dedication of his Lachrimae, or Seven Tears: ‘pleasant are the tears which music weeps’. During this period in England, melancholia had become fashionable, especially in cultural and literary circles, and spawned countless poems, paintings and songs. When Dowland’s lute song Flow My Tears was published in 1600, the instrumental Lachrimae Pavan on which it was based had been in circulation for several years and was the composer’s ‘number one hit’ both in England and on the continent – and four years after the song, he returned to the music and varied it in the ‘seven tears’ for viol consort and lute. Colleagues of Dowland such as Robert Jones and John Danyel explored similar moods and emotions in their own songs, sometimes – as in Danyel’s Eyes look no more – making clear allusions to Dowland’s famous pavan. The Chelys Consort of Viols released their first disc in 2015 to critical acclaim. For the present recording they are joined by lutenist James Akers, and Emma Kirkby, the English soprano who has long been a leading figure in the field of early music."

Much of Mozart’s best-loved music consists of occasional works intended for receptions and parties, balls and banquets, ceremonies and celebrations. These pieces are known to us under a number of different names: serenades, divertimenti, Nachtmusik and notturni are just some examples. In so far as these are genres, the distinctions between them are often blurred and many of them seem to have been used more or less interchangeably. But when the music is so fresh and immediate, labelling it becomes less important. In 1778, Leopold Mozart – who never missed an opportunity to impart his wisdom – wrote to his son describing what characterizes a successful piece: ‘Short, easy and popular… written in a natural, flowing and easy style – and at the same time bearing the marks of sound composition.’ That this recipe was something Wolfgang had already mastered six years earlier becomes obvious when one listens to any of the three Divertimentos recorded here, and it’s equally clear that he hadn’t forgotten it when he composed Eine kleine Nachtmusik ten years later. What Leopold doesn’t mention is playfulness, another quality that Mozart had in spades, and which Terje Tønnesen and his Camerata Nordica explore in their performances, allowing a plaintive Swedish nyckelharpa (‘keyed fiddle’) to be heard in the trio section in Eine kleine Nachtmusik and giving the timpanist an opportunity to rock the party in the closing rondo of Serenata notturna."

The French composer Durufle’s “Requiem” is based on the Gregorian “Missa pro defunctis,” the Latin Mass for the Dead, and the Italian Respighi, in his “Concerto Gregoriano,” used Gregorian chant as a source of inspiration for the harmonious sound of the concerto and for the song-like treatment he gives to the solo violin. Maurice Durufle’s “Requiem” became especially well-known. Its first performance in 1947 was one of the high points of his career; the work not only helped to establish Durufle as a successful composer but also brought him fame far beyond the borders of France. This self-contained, homogeneous and contemplative composition is based on themes from the Gregorian Mass for the Dead. In his work, Durufle succeeded in fusing Gregorian chant, Baroque polyphony and colorful orchestration into a unified whole, and the spiritual, inward-looking character of the chants harmonizes most effectively with the composer’s personal style."

Bach: Complete Harpsichord Music - Claudio Astronio,COMPACT DISC,6,23.39,35.99,2017,"The son of the peerless Johann Sebastian, Wilhelm Friedemann was the least famous Bach of his time. Yet he is now regarded by some as the most brilliant of the Bach children, and is occasionally reported to have been his father's favourite. A master of numerous different keyboard instruments, he was not particularly prolific, and of his 100 or so known works, many remained unprinted until the 20th century. The pieces that do survive and which feature on this recording are brilliantly virtuosic and at the same time quirkily expressive, always striving for originality in ways that ran against the established modi operandi of Bach's day. In fact, the composer was so committed to allowing the musical complexity that came naturally to him to flower fully that, unlike his more business-minded brothers, he resisted adapting his style to suit amateur musicians. In addition, his fantasias, in particular, give us a glimpse into what must have been an impressive flair for improvisation. Alternately witty, cerebral, imaginative, emotive, dark and effervescent, and always challenging, this is not music for the faint-hearted performer. Enter Claudio Astronio, a keyboard-player and conductor with a career that also spans jazz and pop music. For this album, Astronio has chosen to record all of W.F. Bach's keyboard works – which were never assigned to a particular instrument – on the harpsichord (with the exception of four miniatures played on the organ), rendering this recording a truly unique homage to the composer. Fanfare magazine has praised Astronio's ""ability to convey the character and emotional dynamic of a vocal line"" as ""incredibly beautiful, sensitive and deeply touching""."

Their latest recordings in this series is the final Ninth Book (Libro IX), which was published posthumously in 1651 and looks back on the breadth of the composer’s career with lighter pieces in the established forms of his day (prima prattica), in Monteverdi’s own innovative style (seconda prattica), and in a new genre that had begun to eclipse the madrigal in Monteverdi’s twilight years. Though not published in his lifetime, the preface suggests that the Ninth Book was indeed compiled by Monteverdi himself, as a mix of madrigals – still contrapuntal, though simple in texture with at most three parts – and examples of this newly popular canzonetta, with its single accompanied melody. In that sense, the Ninth Book captures the transition from polyphony to monody – from the Renaissance to the early Baroque – in miniature. Le Nuove Musiche’s approach to Monteverdi is both dedicated and informed. They bring the past into the present, considering questions that were asked in the Renaissance and are still relevant in our present musical landscape, thereby making Early Music as new today as any other, while maintaining the highest standards of performance authenticity."

Born in Rouen around 1685, Campion published an influential teaching method for the guitar but his own music is far more than merely academic. Here are Gavottes, fugues, preludes and ‘tombeaux’ (written in memory of contemporaries) that exploit and stretch his instrument’s potential for polyphonic complexity to a degree unprecedented for his time. The album closes with a wonderfully elaborate passacaglia with 36 variations. A special feature of this recording is the instrument played by Bernhard Hofstotter. It’s common enough for Baroque keyboard and guitar music to be played on modern copies of the few instruments to have survived the ravages of time and now preserved in museums. However, the guitar used here was made by Matteo Sellas in around 1640, thoroughly restored in the modern era by Alexander Batov. According to one contemporary, Sellas was the most distinguished Venetian lute-maker of his generation, and the instrument is in excellent shape for its age, with a full-bodied, velvety sound which radically differs from most modern instruments and lends special colour to Campion’s music, with a round, fully resonating and at the same time subtle and fragile sound. The playing of Bernhard Hofstotter combines ‘technical ease with a masterful sense of phrasing’ (Lute Society of America) and reveals ‘a refined rhythmic sensibility and understanding’ (International Record Review). According to Gramophone, Hofstotter’s recordings of music by the Baroque lute virtuoso Silvius Leopold Weiss feature ‘some of the most sympathetic and beautiful Weiss-playing committed to disc’."

His heritage is reflected in this substantial song-cycle for soprano and guitar, receiving here only its second modern recording. The Divan of Moses Ibn Ezra is a setting of 19 poems, in a modern English translation, by a medieval Spanish Jew who wrote, like Castelnuovo-Tedesco almost a millennium later, in exile. Thus the subject of its first section is ‘Songs of Wandering’, before friendship and love turn sour in the second section. Sorrow and defeat also mark the third, ‘Of Wine, and of the Delights of the Sons of Men’ – though still within the composer’s appealingly melodic vein – before the return of spring and a more positive outlook to close the cycle, in which the poet bravely faces ‘The World and its Vicissitudes’ before contemplating mortality with calm resignation in a moving epilogue. The piece is a substantial addition to the growing discography of the composer on Brilliant Classics, including releases dedicated to his guitar studies (BC95219), duets (BC94833), concertos (BC7615) and piano music (BC94811), as well as samples of his prolific output on several compilations. The fine Italian guitarist Giulio Tampalini has his own impressive discography on the label, in music by Paganini (BC95031), Mozzani and Respighi (BC95230), Tarrega (BC94336) and more. Here he is joined by the Polish soprano Joanna Klisowska, who has sung with many major European early-music ensembles. The album is completed with individual songs in Spanish and Italian as well as two settings of Shakespeare.

A significant if shortlived (1903-38) figure in Italian instrumental music during the 1920s and 1930s: a gifted conductor, fluent pianist, practical teacher, essayist and perspicacious observer of the musical life of his times. His own music is celebrated here, and anyone who takes pleasure in Romantic chamber music, the neoclassical idiom of Stravinsky, or the vigorous yet always lyric idiom of Respighi and Casella, will find much to enjoy here. In fact Pilati’s music for piano and for orchestra has received some attention on record; much less so his chamber works, making this new 2CD set an important addition to Brilliant Classics’ unrivalled catalogue of Italian music from 1850-1950. The troubled expression of the three- movement, half-hour sonatas for violin and cello (1928) reflects the temper of their times, whereas the Preludio, Aria & Tarantella on Old Neapolitan Folk Tunes for violin and piano apparently turn away from intense battles between tension and reconciliation with the kind of light touch and folk-inspired humour that may be found in the best early works by Casella. There are several miniatures from the 1920s which attest to Pilati’s elegance and sophistication early in his career, as well as to the excellence of his training in his native Naples (though he moved to Milan at 22 and made his career there). Despite its name, Inquietude is a flowing study for piano, reminiscent of Debussy. The set is completed by his two volumes of Bagatelles for solo piano, which frequently draw on Neapolitan themes: 11 relaxed and convivial pieces in all, of an easy charm that would not disgrace Pilati’s friend Nino Rota, and written in an accessible style which may reflect their dedication to the composer’s three daughters. The album is comprehensively documented with valuable notes on both the composer and his work by the pianist Dario Candela: a student of Aldo Ciccolini, who described his pupil as ‘an excellent pianist of great class’. He is joined here by Francesco Manara – a former leader of the orchestra at La Scala, Milan – and the cellist Luca Signorini who, like Pilati, pursues a diverse career as a performing musician, conductor and writer."

He was born in Naples in 1863 into a family of luthiers, yet surpassed his father and grandfather in a reasonably long career dedicated to the manufacture and promotion of his instrument. After taking over the family workshop in 1905 he transformed it into a cultural centre that covered all aspects of music-making. Alongside his fertile talent for composition displayed on this disc, Calace continued to innovate in manufacture, designing and producing a concerto mandolin which in range and volume would stand up to a fair-sized orchestra, thus enabling many other composers to write for the instrument. He also created a ten-stringed mandolon-cello and a bass archlute, which could replace the bowed double bass in mandolin orchestras. It was on this instrument that Calace was himself a noted virtuoso, and his own family followed his path; including his daughter Maria, to whom the album’s opening Fantasia Poetica is dedicated, and his son Enzo, dedicatee of a lovely Idyll Op.58. Another son, Vincenzo, even attended the prestigious classes of Ferruccio Busoni in Berlin. All the works here have an immediate charm, whether they are reflective in mood such as the Largo mesto (dedicated to Mussolini in its original version as the slow movement of a concerto for mandolin and piano), Slow Minuet and the album’s concluding Elegy, straightforwardly exuberant (a Spanish Dance Op.105) or more ambiguously reflecting Calace’s Neapolitan heritage, in the unstoppable energy of an early Tarantella and the Saltarello Op.79. Having founded the Motus Mandolin Quartet in 2015, the four members belong to two generations of Neapolitan musicians. This is their first recording together. For them, it could have only one subject: Calace, ‘the most charismatic musician in the history of our instrument.’"

His travels around the country provided him with the opportunity to meet a number of influential contemporaries, and the results of this compositional flourishing are wide-ranging, from opera via instrumental music to secular cantatas. This release focuses particularly on the latter, affording the listener a fascinating glimpse into the first appearance of many melodic ideas which would later resurface in Handel's mature dramatic works. Indeed, listeners might well feel as though they are listening to scenes from operas – cantatas were a means, at the time, of circumventing the ban on opera in Rome. The familiar theme of the joys and sorrows of love pervades much of the music, but the pieces are richly varied, particularly in their scoring: we hear flutes, recorders, oboes, bassoons, trumpets and the full contingent of strings, including viola da gamba, in numerous different combinations. Often, the orchestral forces for a particular piece are modest, but the emotional depth that Handel draws out is always striking. A high-calibre, international roster of soloists and ensembles performs the works, with many of the compositions for soprano sung by Stefanie True, whose ""vocal agility, accurate intonation and stylish ornamentation are spot-on in this repertoire"" (Music Web International).

Best-known in posterity as one half of the celebrated Presti-Lagoya duo, she is celebrated on this album as a composer and virtuoso in her own right, half a century after her unexpected death in the middle of a US concert tour, at just 43 years of age. In her booklet-note, Cinzia Milani remarks that she has always considered Presti a role-model, not only for her prodigious talent as a guitarist, but as a female musician in a culture and industry still often dominated by male authority. She presents here six studies by Presti herself, a Danse rhythmique and an Etude du matin, and Presti’s tribute to her own hero, Segovia. Just as Presti dedicated the dance to her husband Lagoya, so Milani follows it with two works which he in turn dedicated to her. Then there are various works by composers little known outside guitar circles such as Miguel Ablóniz and indeed Duarte. Through all these works may be traced the joyous personality of Presti herself, summed up by her granddaughter Isabelle in the booklet as ‘elegant nimbleness, luminous musicality and wonderful self-confidence’. She was friends with many of the composers such as Gontran Dessagnes, who wrote his Tendesse for her in 1954. The work by Guy Morancon is a tribute to her memory, composed in the wake of her death. Finally, Milani has written her own tribute, Quattro Mi, in admiration for the extraordinary facility of Presti in holding down the note E (Mi in solfege) on four different strings simultaneously. By its nature, the album is unique in the catalogue, of immediate interest to guitarists and anyone curious about a great artist of the last century. The booklet contains contributions by the artist as well as by Isabelle Presti, granddaughter of Ida Presti."

Giovanni Francesco was a violinist by training and profession, born and schooled in Livorno but who made his career in Florence, where he became a highly regarded teacher and performer: he led the orchestra in several premieres of Rossini operas such as Il turco in Italia and Il barbiere di Siviglia. Giuliani also composed dramatic music of his own but he was better known in his own time for instrumental pieces which are indebted in style to the galant music of his teacher Pietro Nardini, whose string quartets (BC94438) and sonatas (BC93347) may also be found in Brilliant Classics recordings. The earlier Giuliani composed 12 nocturnes for clarinet and harp which here receive their first complete recording.

Among the most distinguished of the latter company is to be counted Francesco Durante (1684-1755), praised by no less than Jean-Jacques Rousseau as ‘the greatest harmonist in Italy, which is to say in the world.’ Extravagant words, on the face of it, but backed up by many passages and twists of genius in the collection of eight concertos for string ensemble which features in this new recording from a sparky Italian period-instrument ensemble. Each concerto has its own proportions; only the Fifth followswhat we now think of as a three-movement, fast-slow-fast model. For the rest, fugues and double canons alternate with minuets and abrupt presto sections that translate some of the drama of opera into purely instrumental terms. The expression is always at full tilt; Neapolitan, one might say, and indeed it is Durante who passed down to posterity many of the characteristics that are now readily associated with an entire school and locale of composition. A world premiere recording distinguishes this set from its competitors: a concerto in B flat which did not belong to the single surviving hand-written score, but is indubitably by Durante, as its harmonic daring and vivid character will confirm.

Prolific and inventive, Valeri wrote a huge number of pieces for orchestra, organ, harpsichord and piano. Writing at a time of musical transition, Valeri had one foot firmly in his own era –which we would now regard as Classical – following the teachings of the Viennese school, and with some of his pieces bearing the hallmarks of Haydn's and Mozart's influence. At the same time, he remained attached to the then outmoded but still charming galant style, more prone to lavish ornamentation, popular earlier in the 18th century. Valeri was also very much a composer rooted in the land in which he lived – the Veneto region of north-eastern Italy. He wrote many works with specific organs in mind, as can be seen in the use in his scores of rare stops found particularly in the local area. On this recording, Paolo Bottini plays on carefully chosen instruments from churches in the same region, built by the same organ-builder, and with many features in common with those on which the composer would have played, in order to give us an authentic impression of what the music might have sounded like in Valeri's time. At the same time, Bottini makes some of his own decisions regarding sonic balance and use of stops independently of the composer's indications, creating a distinctive rendering of Valeri's music for organ.

Contemporary accounts describe his seemingly superhuman technical abilities and equally striking charisma and stage presence. Yet Liszt was a formidable composer, and his expansion of pianistic possibilities was achieved as much through innovation in his own great piano works as through his astonishing performance on the instrument, if not more. Like many child virtuosos thrust early into busy concert careers (Liszt’s began at the age of nine) he retired early, weary of the spotlight, turning his back on the stage at the remarkably early age of 35. Since he lived to the likewise remarkable old age of 75, much more than the latter half of his life was devoted solely to composition, and having been a pianist of his calibre, the works he created for his own instrument were indeed groundbreaking. Showcasing the demanding pieces in this set – from the thundering of Liszt’s virtuoso side to the mysticism of his deeply spiritual side – are 15 renowned pianists on recordings dating from 1994–2016. Liszt’s piano works may be divided into several diverse categories.

Many such Noëls may be enjoyed on this special collection of both choral and instrumental music, concentrating on the High Baroque era.

The director Kevin Mallon gave it a specially Canadian flavour by interpolating a version of the French carol with a text in the tribal language of the Huron Indians. ‘Colourful performances,’ was the original verdict of Gramophone, on which ‘the soloists and chorus sing with consistent clarity.’ Operatically inclined singers will note the presence in the ensemble of Jane Archibald, who has since become known worldwide as a coloratura soprano of distinction, especially in the role of Zerbinetta in Strauss’s Ariadne auf Naxos. The final disc of Joyeux Noël is an organ recital, moving through the ages from Dandrieu to the grandest examples of late-Romantic organ masses and Christmas pieces by Franck and Dubois. It’s a uniquely compilation, fully annotated, sure to bring a touch of distinction to a festive stocking."

As the longtime bassist for New York's genre-busting Bang on a Can All-Stars, Black is thoroughly tapped into the creative current of today's new music. He's also uniquely attuned to the areas where acoustic music and the sounds of nature can intersect, creating a third and totally unexpected entity that surges with unusually ecstatic energy. ""Listen closely and feel the music,"" he encourages in the album's liner notes. ""The sound, the look, the feel -- it affects me. It gets inside my head, inside my body.

Schoenberg had a close personal tie with many of the composers performed at the association concerts and sometimes even an amical one, as in the case of Zemlinsky.

The commission was from Scottish Ballet, then traditionally managed by the distinguished Russian ballerina, Galina Samsova.

Davis is also a composer of symphonic works, a writer for ballet and a notable Conductor. Following on from Thames Television’s Hollywood series, he created a score for Abel Gance’s epic 1927 film Napoleon, a performance so unique it stimulated a global revival of silent film performances with live orchestra.

European composers with various stylistic roots were confronted with this question. The result is an exciting conceptual album filled with compositional surprises and new sonic ideas which demonstrate how varied the respective composers’ approach to the task was and how they found coherent and creative solutions. The composers reveal differing conceptual approaches when answering these questions. Nystedt and Hubner decided to write a kind of concerto for violin and choir in which the violin as soloist outdoes the choir- in its role as orchestra- with its virtuosity, simultaneously commenting on the test or affirming it with doublings. Hoybye stages a theater piece, assigning clear roles to the solo violin and the choir; the violin, representing the voice of God, enters into a dialogue with the choir which represents the voice of man. They speak to one another, they comment on each other, wrestle with each other, spur each other on and thus develop a musical momentum. Buchenberg works with a cross-fading technique and sound surfaces, Miskinis alternates between the violin taking on the function of a descant and a blending of violin and choir, whereas Gjeilo integrates the violin in the choir’s sound weave, turning it into an additional soprano voice, as it were."

It combines both instrumental and vocal pieces- the latter in instrumental versions- connected to the subject of ‘love’. Using instruments instead of the voice may initially seem perverse for such a title, but to the ensemble it suggests the idea of “other ways of singing about love.” This album thus reaffirms the great value and importance that instruments started gaining in the first half of the 17th century, where they ceased serving merely as accompaniments to the voice and gradually became the main protagonist of the musical scene, attaining a level of virtuosity that had never been explored before."

As Bavouzet states in an exclusive personal note, they “share their association with operatic and symphonic styles. The contrasts of mood in their first movements relate them more closely with music for the operatic stage, while their finales are conceived in purely instrumental terms and make reference to the symphonic domain. On the other hand, these two works are complete opposites as far as their use of wind instruments is concerned. In KV 449 their inclusion is ad libitum, whereas they very often play the principal role in KV 459.”"

Although we are able to precisely define the specific terms used for labeling these musical eras, the interim phases are difficult to name and concepts such as “late baroque” or “pre-classical” are used. The fate reserved to composers who worked in such periods of transition is that of a late or early birth, given that their music is so difficult to grasp in retrospect. The works on this new release are instrumental pieces from the early Classical period, when the Baroque era was fading away and new ideas were being presented. The Capricornus Consort Basel has been highly praised by critics for their sensible interpretations on their previous recordings of Erlebach, Graupner, and Manfredini."

The “Ave Maria”, recorded here for the first time, is without doubt a score of consistent quality and inspiration: it is highly original and seen as more interesting than some of the other major works recorded in this album. The ""Requiem"" for example, poses some historical and stylistic problems: it is an assembly of two works (the “Requiem” and the “Dies Irae” for solo, four-voice mixed choir and orchestra - Modena, F. 656) and the ‘Messa in F major’ for four-voice and orchestral (F. 647). The connection between the two creations, was clearly made because the tonality (F major) is the same for both works. However, there is also a certain thematic cyclicity in the ""Requiem"" and in the ""Dies irae"", which echo parts of the mass. Not all the pieces are at the same, high inspiration ‘niveau’. However Luchesi’s sacred music, too, contains compositions of the most elevated quality, testament of a very important though forgotten composer of the eighteenth century who praises God for the talent he has given him in this detached and incomprehensible design of life and death."

The ensemble’s repertoire is comprised of original compositions and arrangements spanning from the baroque period to commissioned works in which the music of the 1920s is emphasized. To date, ensemble dix has been featured in radio, television, and CD productions, and in concerts throughout Germany, Europe at large, and the United States."

He honored the city by adding the subtitle to his first symphony: The bells of Zlonice. He was inspired by Beethoven's symphony style, with his strongly marked leitmotifs and the clearly structured key schemes. In the series of complete recordings of Dvorak symphonies, the Staatsphilharmonie Nurnberg under Marcus Bosch present here their third album. The Staatsphilharmonie Nurnberg is the largest Bavarian opera orchestra after the Bavarian State Orchestra. 91 musicians make up the ensemble, and it is the house orchestra of the Staatsstheater Nuremberg."

On this record she focuses on works by Mozart and Haydn. After studying at the State University of the Arts in Tokyo, where she was born, the pianist Tomoko Ogasawara continued her studies in Germany at the University of the Arts in Berlin and the University of Music in Freiburg in Breisgau. In Freiburg she received the solo diploma with honors and went on to win first prize in the Competition for German Conservatories. Her teachers include Georg Sava, Tibor Hazay and Georgy Sebok; all of whom influenced her artistic development and led her to early successes in international competitions such as “Maria Canals” (Barcelona) and “Ciara Haskil” (Montreux).

Concertos for jazz clarinet by Jorge Calandrelli, Daniel Freiberg, and Jeff Beal are heard in performances with the world-famous clarinetist Andy Miles. Andy Miles is one of the youngest representatives of a guild whose members received posts as solo clarinetists in German orchestras (in his case with the Hamburg Philharmonic). Later he made his way to Cologne as the principal clarinetist of the WDR Radio Orchestra. Thanks to his ""wild past"" as a saxophonist in rock bands, a tin whistler in folk bands, and a clarinetist in various jazz bands, Miles is able to exercise his activity in many musical fields. He numbers among the few genuine crossover musicians who succeed in mediating between classical and jazz music because they feel at home in both of them. The press has called him »the Marco Polo of the Clarinet.« It should also be mentioned that the famous Alan Silverman was in charge of an additional mastering of our recording in the United States. Alan has worked for artists like Norah Jones, Chaka Khan, The Rings, Dolly Parton, and Keith Richards and received more than fifty Grammy Awards. His Art!

Martin Schmeding now presents this complete recording as a noble collector box that includes a 172-page DVD booklet with 60 colored illustrations and an additional conversation album (Vol. 17, in German language), on which he speaks with Mirjam Wiesemann in Sophie Charlotte Hall of the dome of Berlin about his major project. Max Reger wrote an extensive organ repertoire which places extremely high demands on the performer. On one hand, Reger's organ works are very virtuosic, on the other hand an organist is needed for the interpretation of Reger´s works who knows how to mix the sound of the organ and the surrounding sound of the church so that the listener is able to hear the complex levels of Reger's symphonic compositions with high transparency. Martin Schmeding presents Reger's Organ Compendium to us with power, big breath, and always with the necessary attention to detail - ingredients which are all needed for Reger's works."

He employs infrequently-used instruments, such as the glass harmonica (released for the first time on this recording) and the Hungarian dulcimer, the cimbalom, in the Concerto pour violoncello et orchestra en forme de ‘pas de trois,’ for which not many performers are available. In his largest-scale endeavours, he aimed to process the most complex connections among contemporary events and his own worldview in such an intensive and comprehensive manner that each of these creations would be the only and possibly also the last. One must not forget that Zimmermann, a sensitive, profound man, had to cope with horrific and traumatic experiences during the war.

Christensen is an expert new music interpreter, having world premiered more than 80 works by composers such as Per Norgard, Axel Borup-Jorgensen, Pelle Gudmundsen-Holmgreen, and more."

His fellow tenors sang their highest notes using a delicate and fluty-sounding falsetto technique. But Duprez pioneered the novel technique of singing upper-range notes up to high C in a much more heroic-sounding chest voice- a practice soon adopted by tenors worldwide. One of today’s most thrilling tenors, John Osborn is in constant demand on the world’s most prestigious opera stages. His gorgeous voice is particularly noted for its magnificent top end. Who better, then, to present an album devoted to Duprez’s seminal influence on vocal technique for tenors?

Tchaikovsky’s hauntingly exquisite transcriptions of Russian folksongs, meanwhile, include two melodies later used by Stravinsky in The Firebird and Petrushka. Peter Hill, whose Bach series for Delphian continues to attract superlatives, is here joined for the first time on the label by his long-term duo partner Benjamin Frith.

This record collects five of the most beautiful marches that animate the Holy Week processions in Molfetta, introduced by the typical sound of the “Ti te” that opens every procession.

His extensive body of piano music has been largely neglected despite the fact that it is exceptional, impressionistic, and in the best post-Romantic tradition of ‘lighter’ music – though only relatively ‘light’ in that it is written in traditional harmony. Never shallow, but highly suggestive of moods, emotions, places and colors. Many of the works in this album are receiving their first recording. Alfonso Soldano is a brilliant Italian pianist, the last and highly-regarded pupil of Aldo Ciccolini whose debut recording (piano music of Sergei Bortkiewicz) attracted worldwide acclaim.

Andrew Wright is a rarity in the current day being an expert interpreter and also arranger of operatic themes, and as well as an astonishing virtuosity enabling the drama of the scene to be preserved, he also keeps alive the tradition by which opera tunes became popular. Following the critical praise given to the original ‘Operatic Pianist’ album, this set includes transcriptions and fantasies by Wright, Thalberg, Liszt, Kullak, Leschetizky and Jaëll and amazingly a fine work by Saint-Saëns receiving its world premiere recording.

And yet, even with the most subtle, most distinguished form of interplay there is always one in the trio who plays the part of the primus inter pares- the pianist, of course (usually and by definition leader of the group). That’s exactly where pianist Michael Arbenz, drummer Florian Arbenz and bassist Thomas Lahns come up with their own idea of musical interplay. In fact, what they aim to achieve with their music- their understanding of music- is nothing less than the greatest possible balance of their three voices- starting with the way they work out their own compositions and arrangements, and going right through to the soloistic parts, fully assigned to all three of them. The result is a stupendous musical togetherness, packed with surprising melodic, rhythmic and dynamic turns, played with highest precision even in the most complex, distorted and twisted passages of their compositions, arrangements and solos."

His technique is truly breathtaking. And “technique” does not simply denote the ability to play many notes in quick succession (most musicians can do that), but rather to be able to create a unique singing quality for each note, and maintaining this quality in every imaginable context. He makes every note sing; every note is mesmerizing, even in rapid lines; the chords are luminescent. A musician who can “sing” like this is able to hear every note he plays entirely in that moment; each note makes him credible, and every improvisation becomes a spontaneous composition with nothing left to be added at the end. It is futile to point out single pieces or passages, for Ludwig Hornung’s mastery is omnipresent. His grasp of the music and his instrument are such that we follow his spontaneous journeys through his own compositions as well as the standards of the masters, hanging onto every note, spellbound and wondering where the music will be taking us, disappointed when the piece has come to an end."

With performances by many talentes artists, it presents a panorama of his works. The ‘Portrait’ of Félicien David aims to complement the discography already available with world premiere recordings of the composer’s works. Among these are a glimpse of his orchestral output, with the Symphony no. 3 and the Overture to his opéra-comique La Perle du Brésil, the work that really launched David on his operatic career. But it is above all Christophe Colomb (1847) that deserves mention, for this ode-symphonie with speaker was an ambitious follow-up to the success of Le Désert, performed at the Théâtre-Italien some years earlier. Nevertheless, this anthology does not forget that Félicien David was also a figure of the salons, admired for his intimate music and especially his songs. The programme therefore offers a chance to discover excerpts from the Mélodies orientales for solo piano, a selection of romances in the style of the 1840s, and the very rare early motets for chorus in varied scorings. The culmination of this Portrait is the restoration of Le Jugement dernier, which was intended as the concluding apotheosis of the opera Herculanum, but was finally deleted and has never been published until today."

This project is a special undertaking to celebrate Legault completing his Masters Degree at McGill University this year. Simon Legault first picked up the guitar at age 16. In high school, he won first prize in the provincial contest Secondaire sur Scene playing his original jazz compositions. He then enrolled at College Lionel-Groulx in Sainte-Therese in the pop/jazz guitar program. During this time he won first prize in the Bourses Desjardins d’excellence en musique, still playing his own music. In 2005 he decided to put a quartet together to play his music. In 2006 this group made it to the finales in the Jazz en Rafale contest and won first prize the following year. The Festival guide described the guitarist’s compositions “whose cool, grooving sound reveals a maturity beyond his years. Keep your eyes and ears on this young talent.” His first album was released in 2008, and his second in 2013."

The time spent together discovering other cultures during these trips deeply impacted and inspired the Trio, who are back with a whole new level of complicity and mutual understanding on their new album, Intersections. The hard-won musical cohesion of the group’s three members puts a particular spotlight on groove and melody via a sound at times more acoustic, at others more electric. On their respective journeys, the members of the group had the chance to cross paths with musicians who affected them tremendously. This inspired the idea to bring together the evolving musical universe of the Trio with the influences of three special guests, for each of whom was written a unique composition that would best benefit from their collaboration. Thus the album consists of seven tunes as a trio, and three as a quartet, presenting in their turn Guadeloupean singer and songwriter Malika Tirolien, Canadian/New-Zealand trumpeter Lex French, and Canadian bassist Norman Lachappelle. These precious shared moments, and each member's creativity, meet at the crossroads of their respective paths, the intersections of their musical odysseys."

Her elegant timbre and unmistakably instrumental way of forming the phrases is unique.’ Few singers have voices that approach the purity of Janowitz’s: with its very fast vibrato and ‘white’ production, the focused sound can soar, swoop and dip with astonishing ease and control, the vocal line becoming almost liquefied into a seemingly endless melisma. Janowitz’s recorded catalogue, tends to misrepresent the focus of her career because it downplays her work as a recitalist. Of course, she did tape all of Schubert’s songs for high voice but apart from a couple of late song recitals and a disc of Hindemith’s Das Marienleben, that is all we have to remember her by as a performer of song. So this album will be a welcome addition to her discography. For her Athens recital, Janowitz chose two composers absolutely at the centre of her song repertoire, Franz Schubert and Richard Strauss, with a third, Robert Schumann, forming a bridge between the two."

The multiple prizewinners of the 2016 International ARD Competition are among the absolute shooting stars of the quartet scene and, with their GENUIN album, they show why: cutting edge middle and late Beethoven – definitely worth listening to! The Aris Quartett was founded in 2009 on the initiative of Hubert Buchberger, Professor of Chamber Music at the Frankfurt University of Music and Performing Arts. At the time, Anna Katharina Wildermuth (violin), Noemi Zipperling (violin), Caspar Vinzens (viola), and Lukas Sieber (cello), were still high school students, but already studying their respective instruments as junior students at the music university. Begun as an experiment, this meeting between the four young musicians proved to be a genuine stroke of luck. Zipperling writes: “It was truly a wonderful accident that he chose us in particular. Otherwise it probably never would have occurrec to us to play chamber music in this combination, since at the time we didn’t know each other at all.” Eight years later, the Aris Quartett is one of the most striking quartets of the younger generation."

Tony Alonso, pianist, writes: “The words and melodies that have reflected, shaped, and sustained a rich tradition of hymn singing across a range of Christian denominations are some of the richest treasures of the church. For generations, they have been a source of strength, comfort, and challenge through all the seasons of life. Many of them transcend their native denominational identities and some even find a home outside the church. As we live into the 500th anniversary of the Reformation, I hope these contemporary interpretations of some of the most beloved hymns might unlock some of the finest texts and melodies of our traditions to assemblies and ensembles who might otherwise be reluctant to approach them so that we may continue to nurture a common set of music across Christian denominations that transcends instrumentation or styles.”"

After his Kind of Satie release, Pandolfo once again demonstrates his musical versatility – whether he is drawing from the within the established gamba repertory or from beyond it. Here, Pandolfo delves into the astonishingly prolific instrumental output of Georg Philipp Telemann, a composer so well-versed in the musical diversity of his time that he was more than capable of writing for instruments of which he was not a master. Such was the case when Telemann was writing various sets of Fantasias for solo instruments, and tapping into the demand coming from the burgeoning amateur market in Hamburg. One of these sets of 12 unaccompanied Fantasias – for the viola da gamba – was known to have been composed around 1735 but had been lost until very recently and it is only now that modern-day players are exploring Telemann’s approach to a revitalized genre but on what – by the 1730s – was becoming an increasingly outmoded instrument.

The 1692/1693 work dates from around half a century before two other Baroque scores which Les Nouveaux Caractères has tackled recently and received significant critical approval: Leclair’s Scylla et Glaucus and Rameau’s Les Surprises de l’Amour (the latter, like The Fairy Queen, appearing on Glossa). Being a semi-opera, the music of The Fairy Queen doesn’t need to follow a narrative methodically from start to finish and, indeed, what we get is essentially a series of self- contained masques. Purcell channels the spirit of William Shakespeare’s A Midsummer Night’s Dream rather than using the text of that comedy; many characters appear across the work but yet Purcell’s music is of great coherence. Not unlike Purcell himself, Sébastien d’Hérin has opted not to use a formal chorus but to have a long- established team of musical partners singing the choral parts as well as the solo roles. Among the modern-day singers are to be found Anders Dahlin, Samuel Boden, Caitlin Hulcup (who sings “An Epithalamium”), Virginie Pochon, Guillaume Andrieux, Hjördis Thébault and Caroline Mutel (to whom is entrusted “The Plaint”). Alongside the typical instruments of the string, wind and continuo departments of d’Hérin’s orchestra are to be found a serpent, a cornett and a regal. In the booklet essay, the conductor himself explains how this new production of The Fairy Queen has taken shape over a period of ten years."

His fourth London opera, it was composed in 1713 to a libretto by Giacomo Rossi, also the librettist of the composer’s first great London triumph Rinaldo (1711). And that is just about the extent of any certainty on the subject. It might have been premiered in 1713 in London in a private concert at the Queen’s Theatre, but even this remains unconfirmed. This is one of Handel’s few historical operas, being concerned with Plutarch’s account of the latter part of the life of Lucius Cornelius Sulla, who after taking Rome became a tyrannical despot who murders his opponents, before suddenly retiring to his country estate to enjoy his leisure. The libretto being somewhat weak, it leaves Silla an unlikely candidate to regain a place in the repertoire, but it definitely contains lots of thoroughly rewarding music. Handel itself utilized a significant part of it in his next opera, Amadigi di Gaula. Fabio Biondi and Europa Galante join an overwhelming vocal cast headed by a fantastic Sonia Prina in the title role, with Martina Belli, Sunhae Im, Vivica Genaux, Roberta Invernizzi, Francesca Lombardi Mazzulli, and Luca Tittoto also excelling in their respective parts.

With his debut album the young Bulgarian pianist Martin Ivanov, who already at an early age was critically acclaimed in numerous international competitions, presents the waltzes by Chopin. Although most of the waltzes are written in different major keys and therefore tend to convey a cheerful, bright and entertaining impression, a few are set in minor keys which allow a glimpse of that certain melancholy that is characteristic of Chopin’s oeuvre as a whole. Martin Ivnov was born in 1990 in Plovdiv, Bulgaria into a family of musicians and started to study piano at the age of just four. In the period between 2001 and 2009 he took part in 50 piano competitions in Bulgaria and abroad, always with great success, in particular at the following competitions: Young Virtuosos 2004, International Competition for Young Pianists Ettlingen 2004, Franz Schubert 2005, and LISMA Competition 2013."

By standing in for the sick Edwin Fischer at the Salzburg Festival in 1950 he became an international star. Major tours as a soloist followed. Further highlights in his career were his first tour of Japan, where he appeared in Tokyo alone 14 times, and the first, highly successful tour through the Soviet Union in 1964, which was followed by many other tours. In 1979, Paul Badura-Skoda was the first Western pianist to perform in China after the Cultural Revolution. In the Mozart jubilee year 1991, he played the cycle of all Mozart’s sonatas in Paris, Vienna Munich, Madrid, Tokyo, Hong Kong, etc. Paul describes his performance of the B minor Sonata by Franz Liszt from March 29, 1965 in the Carnegie Hall in New York as “one of the most inspired achievements of my career as a pianist.” To confront a perficious and nasty critique two weeks before in the same venue, Badura-Skoda played as unleashed, with an enormous energy, fuelled in part by internal fury. This concert recording which is to an extent owed to that heat of the moment is being published now, featuring a second interpretation of the same Sonata, a studio recording made in the Mozartsaal of the Vienna Konzerthaus six years later. This version is more controlled and, in the calmer passages, more internalized and contemplative than the New York interpretation.

The music for his third album, Nattsongar, was composed as a commissioned work for the Førde International Folk Music Festival in 2016, and together with his exceptionally skilled band, Apneseth combines musical elements from the four corners of the globe. “In this project I wanted to emphasise elements I feel all kinds of folk music share, from the gentle and intangible to the rhythmic and playful,” Apneseth says. The music on Nattsongar was commissioned by the Førde Festival in 2016, and was given its world premiere there. But the influence of the festival in the project goes far beyond the commission itself. Apneseth has a close relationship with the festival. In the cover notes he writes: “It was a great pleasure for me to write music for the Førde Festival in particular, as it has provided me with musical inspiration from all over the world since I was a child. In many ways this event must bear some of the responsibility for my having become a musician.” The work Nattsongar is Apneseth’s attempt to distil his own experiences and encounters from the Festival, and is “a sort of tribute to an event that accentuates what various traditions and cultures have in common rather than cultivating their differences.”"

Composed in 1990, in Verkundigung the groundwork for his subsequent work is laid out. In exploring noise and densification, Ablinger thematises perception itself: raising awareness about listening and, through listening, about the listener. “My work on Verkundigung began when Marcus Weiss urged me to come up with an improvisation piece. Around that time, I happened upon Domenico Veneziano's painting Verkundigung, and found my own musings reflected in that painting's stark opposition between symmetrical Renaissance architecture and the free “gestures” of the angel and the Virgin Mary. At some point, I began striving to dissolve this very opposition of architecture and gesture, aiming for a conception which could contain both elements at once, in every moment – and theoretically in every sound; where one might merge at any moment into the other, or where one may appear in the other’s place.” PA ""Peter Ablinger is one of the few artists today who uses noise without any kind of symbolism - not as a signifier for chaos, energy, entropy, disorder, or uproar; not for opposing something, or being disobedient or destructive; not for everything, for eternity, or for what-have-you. As in all these cases of music deliberately involving noise, noise is the case, but for Ablinger: this alone. Peter Ablinger has also come a long way in questioning the nature of sound, time, and space (the components usually thought central to music), and his findings have jeopardized and made dubious conventions usually thought irrefutable. These insights pertain to repetition and monotony, reduction and redundancy, density and entropy."""

Kosztolanyi was born in Szabadka (Subotica) in 1885, then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, but which now lies in northern Serbia. The city serves as a model for the fictional town of Sarszeg, in which he set his novella Skylark as well as The Golden Kite. Kosztolanyi studied at the University of Budapest, where he met the poets Mihaly Babits and Gyula Juhasz, and then for a short time in Vienna before quitting and becoming a journalist – a profession he stayed with for the rest of his life. In 1908, he replaces the poet Endre Ady, who had left for Paris, as a reporter for a Budapest daily. In 1910, his first volume of poems The Complaints of a Poor Little Child brought nationwide success and marked the beginning of a prolific period in which he published a book nearly every year. In 1936, he died from cancer of the palate. The literary journal Nyugat (Hungarian for ""West""), which played an invaluable role in the revitalization of Hungarian literature, was founded in 1908 and Kosztolanyi was an early contributor, part of what is often called the ""first Nyugat generation"", publishing mainly in poetry. Starting in the 1920s he wrote novels, short stories, and short prose works, including Nero, the Bloody Poet (to the German edition of which Thomas Mann wrote the introduction), Skylark, The Golden Kite and Anna edes. In 1924 he published a volume of verse harkening back to his early work, entitled The Complaints of the Sad Man. Kosztolanyi also produced literary translations in Hungarian, such as (from English, at least) Shakespeare's ""Romeo and Juliet"", ""The Winter's Tale"", Lewis Carroll's ""Alice in Wonderland"", Thornton Wilder's ""The Bridge of San Luis Rey"", Lord Alfred Douglas' memoirs on Oscar Wilde and Rudyard Kipling's ""If—"".

He originally composed these concertos for piano and string quintet, later also for piano and orchestra. They were the first in a row of 17 momentous concertos created in Vienna and consequently founding his fame as virtuoso to the Viennese audience. On this recording you listen to the first two of these four piano concertos in a version for piano and string quintet. Soloist is Christoph Soldan, who reached his break-through to active international concert playing in a tour with Leonard Bernstein in summer 1989. The German press describes Christoph Soldan as an artist personality who works with the spiritual intensity and soulful dimension of a piece of music, rather than giving a purely technical virtuoso performance. This challenge to music and to himself is rarely seen today.

He began his musical journey as a chorister by joining his brothers in the world-renowned Choir of King’s College, Cambridge, under the tutelage of Stephen Cleobury. He went on to achieve early success through the BBC Young Musician of the Year title, the Guilhemina Suggia Gift, the Shell London Symphony Orchestra Gerald MacDonald Award, as well as receiving a Classical Brit Award at the Royal Albert Hall. Guy now plays a 1714 Tecchler cello, and in its third centenary he set out to celebrate the life of the instrument and its creator, commissioning a number of new works. He explains: ‘I began to ask myself lots of questions – How did David Tecchler end up settling in Rome, who was he making cellos for, and how did this cello come into my hands? What is my journey and role as a cellist in the 21st century? I decided to mark this anniversary by commissioning three works as gifts for the cello by celebrated British composers David Matthews, Mark Simpson and Charlotte Bray. I asked them to think of the role of the cello in the last three centuries and to let their imagination run wild.’ Guy’s inspiration then led him to Italy, taking his cello back home to get to the root of some of these questions. Joined by friends from both countries, recorded at locations close to his heart, and featuring works from across his cello’s 300 years, this album traces that musical journey, from Cambridge to Rome."

In this seemingly narrow field of interest, we have encountered inspired, idiosyncratic and beautiful music. Composers who set out to write for this combination maximize the possibilities of the two instruments to the fullest. Consequently the music consists of significant contrasts in dynamics, register, expression and timbres. Composers tend to allow the creative juices to flow when composing for trombone and organ. They create cathedrals of sound and counterbalance this grandeur by exploiting opportunities to play softly, almost inaudibly. With few exceptions, our repertoire was written during the last half-century, and this allows us to help ourselves to the plethora of musical pickings from the twentieth and the twenty-first century. On this album, we present works composed exclusively for us, in addition to one core work for trombone and organ, Petr Eben’s Two Invocations. Stig Nordhagen has written an opening piece which will knock the socks off the listener, Lars-Thomas Holm has composed a towering epic, and Jon Laukvik has provided us with an opulent harmonized capriccio. Arne Rodvelt Olsen’s three contributions vary in dimension from the cheerful Intrada, via the stately and varied Fantasia, to Missa’s extensive musical universe.

I find that the term also naturally applies as a model to the experience of temporal and spatial dimensions in musical “discourse,” where the immediate memory of events in the past, and the expectations of events in the future, fills and enriches the moment of listening. Music creates its own chronotope, a spacious ‘now,’ colored by the sensory perception of a past, present, and future. The collaborative efforts of soloist Fredrik Fors, conductor Christian Eggen and the Oslo Philharmonic Orchestra excellently work in bringing out the work’s conceptual intention and musical character. Fredrik embodies all that I could ever wish for in a soloist.

Mendelssohn wrote that the piece ‘lies very near my heart’, and with its stately grandeur and religiosity, plus its sheer magnitude – double the length of any of his other symphonies – it stands amongst his most impressive works. Posthumously categorised by editors as the composer’s second symphony, it is also known as a ‘song of praise’ and three talented soloists join the LSO and the world-class Monteverdi Choir for this recording. While Gardiner is well-versed in the German’s output, this release documents his first performance of the work. In an interview for The Arts Desk, he said: It’s a piece I’ve been looking at for years, and I’ve never conducted it. I was a bit sceptical at first, thinking that it was the torso of a symphony with a cantata bolted on. But it isn’t. It’s a delight. It has a lot of the inventiveness and sheer melodic flow of the young Mendelssohn and it’s perfectly calibrated and constructed.’ Presented as a Pure Audio Blu-ray and SACD Hybrid package - which includes master quality audio and downloadable content - the Lobgesang is the perfect end to Gardiner's exploration of Mendelssohn, who wrote pieces that are known the world over but also has so much more to offer. Summing up his feelings at the end of the project, the great conductor said: ‘My admiration for Mendelssohn has gone up enormously, as a result of really digging deep into these symphonies...it’s so rewarding with this group of players, they’re willing to go to the last enth degree, in terms of detail of phrasing and articulation, and that’s a joy.’"

The artistic credo of George Lloyd (1913-1998) conveys the directness and emotional honesty of his music. He wrote in a traditional idiom enriched by a close study of selected models, Verdi and Berlioz chief among them. His music is not derivative, however. It is distinctive and written with integrity. There is a remarkable consistency to his output, most of which was created spontaneously and without the incentive of a commission. He was fortunate enough to discover his individual and versatile musical voice at an early age. The deceptively artless quality of his scores stems from a rigorous grounding in composition techniques. Lloyd had found a champion of his music in conductor Edward Downes (1924-2009). Downes conducted the first performance of Lloyd’s Eighth Symphony (1961, orchestrated 1965) with the BBC Northern Symphony Orchestra, broadcast on Radio 3 on 4 July 1977. Many listeners were stopped in their tracks by the work’s melodic strength and imaginative scoring.

But behind the joyous dance that overtook the stage lay the societal struggles a jazz musician endured to present that 90 minutes of musical freedom – a tale of police harassment, systemic oppression and constant battles for equality. Fast forward to 2017 and composer-arranger-pianist John Beasley is using Monk’s spontaneous movements and experiences as the basis for conducting radically reconceived versions of the late composer’s music for his critically acclaimed big band project: MONK’estra."

Among his more than 130 works are forty pieces for wind ensemble, including seven symphonies, fifteen concertos, a Mass, and a multitude of chamber works. He was born in New Bedford, MA, attended the Oberlin Conservatory and studied composition with Joseph Wood. He studied at the Mozarteum in Salzburg, Austria, and completed his doctorate at Michigan State University with his principal teacher H. Owen Reed. The Utah Wind Symphony was founded in July of 2010 in Salt Lake City. The UWS membership includes a mix of professional freelance musicians, music educators and faculty from Utah’s universities. The UWS has been hired as the “pit orchestra” for shows at Salt Lake’s Grand Theater, collaborated with KBYU, to produce “Highway 89” series and has been a featured performing ensemble at the Utah Music Educators Association convention, and Utah Arts Festival. UWS is the lead for commissioning David Maslanka’s “Symphony No. 9”.and have performed with soloists: Allen Vizzutti, Tim McAllister, Larry Zalkind, Frank Crawford, and Travis Peterson.

Their instantaneous musical and personal chemistry left no doubt that a new ensemble was born. Works by Koechlin and Peterson are performed with the original instrumentation. In the remaining works on the album, the flute assumes the role of the voice in the Schubert songs, the saxophone the second flute in the Doppler, and the role of the voice in the Faure and Strauss songs. The trio relies upon their collective imaginations and wide breadth of performance experience when choosing repertoire that can work for this unusual instrumentation. Their creative recital programs showcase the trio in various coloristic combinations that allow them to shine as soloists as well as a charismatic ensemble. Writing in 1910, the great Italian composer, pianist, and author Ferruccio Busoni endorsed the concept of transcription. He maintained that the moment composers transferred ideas from their imaginations to musical notation, a transcription had already taken place. He also believed that because every performance of a piece differed slightly from the previous performance, each new rendering was a transcription. This spirit is the foundation of The Yargo Trio."

It is with a master sleuth’s methods that Gertrud Schilde has probed the enigmatic and monumental Ciaccona from Johann Sebastian Bach’s Partita in D minor and uncovered spectacular evidence in the form of a whole series of traditional chorale melodies hidden away in its intricate compositional design. On this eye-opener of an album the enterprising violinist teams up with the Northern German Chamber Choir to present her revealing discoveries. Martin Luther’s consoling Easter hymn “Christ lag in Todesbanden” runs like a red thread through the work. The chorales, from “Jesu, deine Passion” through “Den Tod niemand zwingen kunnt” to “Jesu, meine Freude,” deal with the double theme of death and resurrection. This is surely no coincidence. Bach penned this work not too long after the death of his first wife. It was not until he returned from an official trip to Karlsbad that he learned of this tragic event- when his beloved wife already lay in her grave. It is not thus surprising that traces of Maria Barbara are encountered in the Ciaccona. However, Bach would not have been Bach if he had not avoided obvious allusions, preferring instead to use a subtly encoded numerical mysticism. Again and again his wife’s name can be deciphered; the year of her death can be found as well as the names of their children. In this way the Ciaccona occupying a central and special place in the cycle of three sonatas and three partitas for violin solo becomes a magnificent memorial tribute to his late wife."

A swim in the cold Seine did him in. Today hardly anybody remembers that Bizet also composed piano music. To our good fortune, Johann Blanchard’s inventory of his rarities cabinet has yielded more new discoveries that will make the hearts of music lovers beat faster-while the lastest recording technology will have the same effect on those of audiophiles. Bizet was an outstanding pianist who already at the age of ten enjoyed the privilege of instruction at the Paris Conservatory- including lessons in composition. And so it is not surprising that his works for piano represent the very best of their times. Already the “Grande Valse de Concert” that the sixteen-year-old boldly labeled his Opus 1 and the “Premiere Nocturne” op. 2 composed during the same year display the genuinely orchestral design so typical of Bizet’s piano music."

She was born in Tokyo, Japan in 11979 and has been living in the UK since 1993. She stumbled into composition when she was asked to take up a second study at Royal College of Music Junior Department; though she took up the cello a few years later, composition came to mind first, as she had always enjoyed notating familiar tunes like movie themes and pop songs.

At times the trumpet is brash and lyrical, expressing ecstasy; in other instances it is strident and rhythmic perhaps reflecting charges into battle; and yet in an instant it reappears low and mellow in what could be heard as a faux-lullaby. The virtuosity in this piece is not to be understated. The next two concerti were inspired by a trip Vollrath took to China and his powerful impression of “a complex culture which contained an old traditional heritage with a new contemporary injection.” He expresses this fusion especially in “Land of Lanterns” in which he uses various layers of melodies to create rich harmonies and active polyphony; the moments in which the solo clarinet returns to a pure pentatonic are especially poignant. “Dragon Land” further explores Vollrath’s time in China, approaching his experience with a heightened sense of drama. Angular clarinet melodies, quick dynamic changes, and flashes of folk melodies present vignettes that reflect a society where ancient practices and modern influences coexist, at times in discord and at times in harmony. Coincidentally, the final movement of this piece was inspired by warrior monks and became the impetus for the album. A warrior monk is a person trained deeply in both spiritual studies and martial arts; they are engrained with a vast knowledge of their culture and entrust that heritage to the pupils they train. At the same time, they are equipped with the skills to defend it at all costs. This duality inspired Vollrath to create this collection of works, dedicated to those who strive to cultivate acceptance and respect for other cultures. Moreover, it is dedicated to the memory of those who have sacrificed their lives to do so. This is Carl Vollrath’s fourth release on Navona Records. The title And Bugles Sang comes from one of the poems used in Britten’s “War Requiem.” Land of Lanterns was written in response to what Vollrath felt was left unsaid in Dragon Land."

Many of the album’s works feature driving rhythms and a joyfully relaxed sensibility. Even dissonance is used playfully or as a counter weight to beautiful lyricism. Such consistency in manner across six pieces by six diverse composers is obviously remarkable, and it makes FLEETING REALMS a very special musical collection. The album’s tone is set by three works: Bruce Babcock’s Irrational Exuberance, Joyce Tang’s Snowy Landscapes, and Nora Morrow’s Luca’s Dream. Each is powerful, yet gentle, and exudes a kind of musical warmth that draws the listener into the rest of the album. Irrational Exuberance, for alto saxophone, cello, and piano, is thematic and rhythmically active, and features conversational imitation between its three instruments. Although interior sections of Irrational Exuberance are more subdued, Babcock’s work is markedly hopeful and confident. Tang’s Snowy Landscapes and Morrow’s Luca’s Dream perfectly embody the subject matter of their titles. Luca’s Dream is scored for solo vibraphone, and Morrow clearly exploits its bell-like sound to emphasize the work’s overall innocence. A fantasia of sorts, Luca’s Dream moves through a series of different melodic ideas, which are united by their rhythmic energy. Beginning in a very sweet, diatonic space, Luca’s Dream becomes increasingly chromatic until its final section, which returns to the gentleness that carries through most of the work. Snowy Landscapes is more texturally active than these other two works, but is nonetheless beautiful and welcoming. Scored for piano trio, Snow Landscapes begins and ends with sections of long violin and cello melodies accompanied by a resonant piano part. In between, we hear more contrapuntal and energetic textures, which, like Irrational Exuberance, feature playful imitation between the trio’s instruments. David Maki’s Five Impromptus for Two and Craig Madden Morris’s Crosscurrents are also notable because they are the album’s most dissonant works. Nevertheless, they approach their dissonance with a warmth and playfulness that fits well with the character of the other works on FLEETING REALMS. Crosscurrents, for example, begins with dissonant solo piano, which eventually gives way to a stately and Romantic cello part whose lyricism comes to dominate the rest of the piece."

Listeners will recognize several names as PARMA regulars, including Daniel Perttu, Hans Bakker, and Paul Osterfield. The album opens with Hilary Tann’s Anecdote for solo cello and orchestra. Inspired by Wallace Stevens’s nature musings in his poem “Anecdote of the Jar,” the work casts the cello solo as a soliloquy, its message elaborated and transformed by wilder orchestral textures. Hans Bakker’s Cantus follows, an intriguing and expressive work for string orchestra. The intimate drama of Cantus is contrasted by mystery and majesty in Daniel Perttu’s lyrical overture To Spring. Written in honor of his daughters, To Spring was inspired by William Blakes poetic ode of the same name. In his profoundly emotional string orchestra piece In Memoriam, Jan Järvlepp honors the memory of his late brother—conforming to no style or influence but that of his own intense grief. Following In Memoriam is Pierre Schroeder’s Late Harvest, a lush, emotional work for strings, clarinet, and piano that forms a part of his eleven-movement magnum opus Voyage. Closing the album is Paul Osterfield’s concertante wind ensemble piece Silver Fantasy, a vibrant celebration of the flute and piccolo with lyrical melodies, dynamic rhythmic energy, and Ivesian pastiche. Together, the works that make up TOMORROW’S AIR encompass a wide spectrum of emotion and drama. Welsh composer Hilary Tann’s “beautiful, lyrical” music is strongly influenced by the natural world. She is a published haiku poet and her compositions have been widely commissioned, recorded, and broadcast by ensembles such as Tenebrae, Cappella Clausura, Marsyas Trio, Thai Philharmonic, and BBC National Orchestra of Wales. Her recent choral music can be heard on the Narvona Records release EXULTET TERRA (NV6069). Dutch composer Hans Bakker has written music for chamber groups, orchestra, carillon, and choir, including the choir cycle Prasasti. He has been featured on Navona Records albums eight times, most recently appearing with Peter Greve on LINES TO INFINITY (NV6070). Daniel Perttu’s neo-romantic music has been praised for “blending mystery, action, and excitement.” His works have been performed at numerous festivals, concerts, and conferences on four continents and in more than thirty states across America. He is currently Associate Professor at Westminster College. Perttu’s music has appeared on five Navona Records albums, most recently on PINNACLE (NV6022). Canadian composer Jan Järvlepp identifies strongly with postmodern musical styles, writing music that is accessible to many audiences. He is active in his home city of Ottawa, having received premieres by the Ottawa Symphony Orchestra (Garbage Concerto) and the Ottawa Chamber Music Festival (Pierrot Solaire). Music by French-American composer Pierre Schroeder has been said to have an emotional, cinematic style. He is an active composer of classical chamber music and jazz, with credit in films and soundtracks, most notably of the documentary “America the Bountiful.” His large work Voyage can be heard on Navona Records’s VOYAGE (NV6000). Paul Osterfield’s music has been performed in Europe and the United States, by ensembles including Ascendo3, the Great Noise Ensemble, the Blakemore Trio, and numerous university wind ensembles. He has won numerous awards, and has been a fellow at the MacDowell Colony. Osterfield has been featured on several PARMA albums, including SOUND AND FURY (NV5978) on Navona Records."

The composer’s dexterous control of the orchestra shines on this release, and the impassioned playing of the Moravian Philharmonic Orchestra, under the direction of Petr Vronský, only accentuates the sheer strength of Carollo’s compositions. Ampersand, Carollo’s first CD was awarded ‘Best Classical CD’ at the 10th Annual Hawaii Music Awards Ceremony in 2006. The Transfiguration of Giovanni Baudino marks two Parma Recordings milestones. It is the 500th Parma album released and is also Parma’s first album to be simultaneously released on vinyl. Carollo was a participant in Parma Recordings’ groundbreaking November 2015 recording session in Havana, Cuba. His Burlesque was featured on the June 2016 album Abrazo: The Havana Sessions. The composer’s musical training included studies with Dr. Robert Wehrman. Before retiring to compose fulltime, Carollo had a long career as a mental health professional for the state of Hawaii, having received a master’s degree in Clinical Psychology from San Diego State University. Of past Carollo album Starry Night for String Orchestra a reviewer wrote, “This is a starry night with meteors and perhaps an exploding star in the midst of it!”"

These works include repertoire standards, little-recorded rarities, and recent music from contemporary composer Kevin Cope. Collaborative pianist Julie Nishimura joins Nichols for these recordings. Among the widely-known works featured on the album is the operatic and energetic Adagio and Tarentella by Ernesto Cavallini, a clarinetist/composer known in Italy as “the Paganini of the clarinet.” As the principal clarinetist at Milan’s La Scala opera house, Cavallini’s astounding virtuosity caught the attention of Giuseppe Verdi, who was moved to write the stunning, lyrical Andante for clarinet in act three of his opera La forza del destino (The Force of Destiny)—a piece also included on this release. Nichols also features a favorite recital piece, Elegia. Composed by Aurelio Magnani, another Italian clarinetist/composer, the work is little known and rarely recorded. Two French staples are included as well: Henri Rabaud’s 1901 Solo de concours, Op. 10 and Camille Saint-Saëns’s Sonata for Clarinet and Piano, Op. 167. Each work is divided into contrasting sections or movements, thus displaying the clarinet’s wide-ranging sound in different contexts. The album’s two American works are both for unaccompanied clarinet. John Cage’s rarely heard, early Sonata for Clarinet is a challenging work: at its premiere in 1933, the clarinetist refused to play it, forcing the composer to play it with one finger at the piano. Even as an early piece, it foreshadows Cage’s later forays into the radical avant-garde. Kevin Cope’s 2012 piece Sirocco rounds out the album. The word “sirocco” refers to a desert wind that blows around the Mediterranean coastline, evoked in the piece by wandering tonality and blending of different musical styles. Clarinetist Christopher Nichols is nationally and internationally active as a solo performer. As a soloist, he has been featured at conferences of the International Clarinet Association, European Clarinet Association, and College Music Society. His performances have been broadcast on Kansas and Michigan Public Radio, and have been included in the Audio Performance Archive of College Music Symposium. In 2015, his solo work garnered him an Established Artist Fellowship from the Delaware Division of the Arts. Nichols also frequently performs in ensembles. He is a current member of the Christiana Winds, and regularly performs with mid-Atlantic orchestras such as the Pennsylvania Philharmonic, the Kennett Symphony, and the Allentown Symphony Orchestra. He has collaborated with the Serafin String Quartet, the Taggart-Grycky Duo, and members of the Philadelphia Orchestra and Baltimore Symphony. Nichols is a dedicated teacher, having been Assistant Professor of Clarinet at the University of Delaware since 2013. He is also the Audio Reviews Editor for The Clarinet, and is a Légère Reeds Endorsing Artist and a Buffet Artist Clinician, performing exclusively with Légère Signature Series reeds and Buffet clarinets. Julie Nishimura has been faculty accompanist for the Department of Music at the University of Delaware since 1988. She is active throughout the country as a performer, appearing at music festivals, such as the chamber music series of Carnegie Hall’s Weill Recital Hall; with several symphony orchestras; and as a guest artist at over 45 college campuses. She is artistic director and co-founder of Distant Voices Touring Theatre, which tours two documentary theatrical works: Distant Voices, based on Nishimura’s father’s account of his time in a Japenese-American internment camp, and September Echoes, which chronicles the events surrounding the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Kevin Cope’s music has a dark, engaging character. He works can be tonal and atonal, and is known for his mixing of styles—such as Arabian modes with Western theory. Sirocco was commissioned by clarinetist Arianna Tieghi for a project called “From USA,” where she performs a piece by a composer from each of the 50 states. This is also the world premiere recording of Sirocco."

Across the album, Hugill demonstrates an exceptional sensitivity to text and melody, both of which shine through his clear and lyrical musical language. The four sets of songs on the album are consummate modern lieder, and one can easily imagine hearing them at a private vocal recital alongside the Romantic song cycles of the nineteenth century. Hugill’s songs employ a classic approach to vocal writing, and are defined by smooth melodies and supportive accompaniments that establish the setting for the text and vocalist. To this end, Hugill works with fascinating texts on this album, many of which lead to interesting and unusual musical structures. An excellent example of this is the song, “To His Love”, from the set Four Songs to Texts by Ivor Gurney. Here, instead of fitting the poetry to a traditional song form, Hugill composes something more closely representative of the text’s narrative, resulting in the sudden quieting of the piano so the song’s last lines are sung in as intimate a setting as possible. The album’s titular work, Quickening, stands out both for its defined form and its instrumentation of mezzo-soprano, viola, and piano. The songs in Quickening flow continuously from one to another, and, with the addition of the accompanying viola, Hugill is able to exploit a variety of textures that are inaccessible in his songs for voice and piano. There is also an attractive lightness to Hugill’s writing for mezzo-soprano, which makes the sound world of the song cycle more inviting. Throughout QUICKENING, both Hugill’s music and the performances of baritone Johnny Herford, violist Rosalind Ventris, mezzo-soprano Anna Huntley, and pianist William Vann convey the essential delicacy and intimacy of a salon-style vocal recital. As a result, the listener cannot help but walk into the world of each song cycle and dream of hearing them in a homey space of their own. Hugill’s songs mark the modern extension of the nineteenth century lieder, art songs that should be in one’s home. Consider the intimacy of these works and the kinds of spaces they evoke. Hugill’s songs respond to there individual texts, so consider the changes in mood and structure across each of the album’s song cycles, as informed by the specific songs’ texts. A striking feature of this album are the settings of the contemporary poems by Rowan Williams, the former Archbishop of Canterbury."

The result is rising American composer Gregory W. Brown's Missa Charles Darwin, a secular Mass using texts from Darwin's On the Origin of Species and other writings. The piece, a collaboration between Brown and New York Polyphony bass Craig Phillips, who compiled and edited the texts, venerates Darwin as a seeker—a man who went against the grain in search of explanations and connections in the natural world. Casting the project in the form of a Mass creates clever parallels between the original liturgical form and Darwin's writings, pitting (for instance) the Mass's appeals for mercy against the mercilessness of natural selection. The piece's many interrelated passages and evocations of symmetry—present in both the traditional mass and this new work—underscore the beauty and eloquence of Darwin's writings."

In 1993 Nicolas Pasquet, winner of the 1987 Besancon competition, was appointed chief conductor. The orchestra now performs as the Pannon Philharmonic Orchestra."

His string quintets were intended for a market of cultivated amateurs, with parts for a second cello or bass. No. 10 in F minor, Op. 32 reflects Beethoven’s influence, its Sturm und Drang elements revealing a masterly balance between the stable and unpredictable. No. 22 in E flat major, lively and playful, offers an almost Schubertian songfulness. Of the first volume, Gramphone wrote: ‘these five players make a beguiling case for this music.’ The combination of string quartet with double bass has opened up a richness of tone and distinct soundscape that the Elan Quintet has dedicated to exploring, celebrating works by renowned composers such as Schubert, Dvorak and Cambini, working with contemporary artists in creating new works for quintet, and rediscovering neglected masterpieces by composers including Onslow and Bridge. The members of the Elan Quintet, Benjamin Scherer Quesada, Lelia Iancovici, Julia Chu-Ying Hu, Dmitri Tsirin, and Matthew Baker, formed the ensemble in Valencia in 2014 having worked with each other extensively in the opera orchestra of the Palau de les Arts as well as in masterclasses and in chamber music."

Filled with elegance and refinement, these three sonatas display the range of Ries’s creative gifts as a composer, skillfully synthesizing the clarity and discipline of Mozart’s Viennese Classical style with the inventiveness and freedom of the new Romanticism developing in the early 19th century. Volume 1 was regarded as ‘simply too good to miss’ by MusicWeb International. Eric Grossman is a versatile performer hailed for his flawless technique, superb musicianship, and commitment to a wide range of repertoire. A graduate of The Juilliard School, where he studied with Dorothy De Lay, Grossman enjoys an active performing career.

His Piano Trio No. 1 in B flat major incorporates melancholy, serenity and vivid excitement in equal measure, while the Piano Trio No. 2 in G minor though written at a time of personal tragedy for Dvorak, achieves a triumphant and emphatic conclusion. Fanfare said of the first volume of Trios, ‘I would urge you with special pleading to acquire this release for what may well be the best Dvorak ‘Dumky’ on disc ever.’ Combining technical mastery, expressive depth and performance experience, pianist Alon Goldstein, violinist Ilya Kaler and cellist Amit Peled have joined forces to form one of the most exciting trios on the international scene. Each virtuoso member of the ensemble has a successful solo career; together they bring vitality to the concert stage with their dynamic musical interplay and collaborative spirit. After only a few seasons as a trio the group has already been compared to the legendary ‘Million Dollar Trio’ of Arthur Rubinstein, Gregor Piatigorsky and Jascha Heifetz. The Tempest Trio has performed in cities throughout the US, Europe, Israel, and Asia, and in recent years the ensemble presented the complete Schumann, Brahms and Dvorak Trio cycles at the renowned Seattle Chamber Music Festival and the Four Arts Society in Palm Beach as well as New York’s Town Hall."

Their new recording, Simplicity Itself, is a document of their wonderful balance between instrumental brilliance, programming acuity, commissioning zeal, and warm performance style. The album begins and ends with works by Boston-based composer Robert Honstein, whose individual approach to minimalism involves a playful approach to shifting phrase lengths and subverting rhythmic expectation through displacement. The duo is joined here on the opening track, Patter, by guest violinist Katie Hyun, and in a display of New Morse Code’s versatility and open minded approach, Collins joins Competello on mallet percussion for the final track Unwind, a contemplative study in polyrhythm. Tonia Ko’s Hush operates more gesturally, and her style is at times reminiscent of the type of sound painting and economy of materials one hears in the work of George Crumb. There is plenty of complexity in the works on this recording, but by naming the album Simplicity Itself (taken from the Virginia Woolf text in Ko’s work) New Morse Code seems to suggest that deep within this music is an underlying ground of fundamental elements that is a source of connection.

Philidor’s approach is very different. His use of the term ’modulation’ has less to do with musical theory and more with the exploration of colour in the way an artist might modulate from one tone to another in a painted canvas. Each of the six quartets takes us on a quirky journey filled with unexpected harmonic twists and turns. It can be eloquent and charming, but can also surprise the ear and nudge the very edge of sensibility. With so much playful chromaticism, the quartets must have seemed wildly progressive for adherents of the old régime. Although he remains faithful to the standard Italian sonata movements and French dance forms of the time, there is always a twist.

In courtly feudal society dilettante meant a musically educated member of the upper class. He was distinguished from the professional musician only by the fact that music was not his means of making a living. In the new society it becomes a term for the less musically competent, an amateur instrumentalist of vocalist, and quite distinct from the educated ‘connoisseur’ or professional musician. It is also evident that this type of person, who connects with music on a modest level, is the dominant part of the audiences that attend the emerging ‘concert’ entertainments. It is for this specific audience that an abundance of new compositions appeared, particularly in the area of chamber music. From the beginning of the century the flute was chief among the instruments preferred by enthusiasts, as well as the highly educated non-professional connoisseurs. The flute, in its late 17th century form, being a relatively ‘modern’ instrument – and a fashionable one - joined with the keyboards in a pivotal role. The previously dominant violin drifted more and more into the domain of professional musicians and virtuosos.

Beginning with a sometimes melancholy picture of earth-bound humanity (Winter and Wassail), the record moves through nativity songs (A Child Is Born) towards the point at which Christian and pagan traditions come together in an adoration of the Virgin which is often expressed in the passionate language of the courtly lover. A sense of human perceptions being profoundly altered by the events of Christmas is evoked in Mary’s Son, Goodwill on Earth and a French 12th century conductus touches on the theme of Rebirth. Thys Yool has been a popular Christmas title in the Nimbus catalogue for many years.

This award-winning album of first recordings of Imogen Holst's chamber works (originally released on the Court Lane Music label) is an important addition to the NMC catalogue, and a wonderful tribute to a signifant 20th-century British composer. Stylistically, many of the works share a similar soundworld to early Tippett and Finzi, however during the 1930s Imogen heard Berg's Wozzeck in Vienna, which had a profound impact. Her Sonata for Violin and Cello, written during this time, explores a darker, more unsettling dissonance. There is another reason that this release is important to NMC. It is thanks to Imogen (and Colin Matthews) that NMC Recordings was created, back in 1989, with support from the Holst Foundation. Colin Matthews (Composer/NMC Executive Producer) says..."" Imogen Holst was a visionary. When together we established the Holst Foundation, not long before her death in 1984, she was clear that she did not want its future role to be to subsidise her father’s music in the way that most other composer trusts function. Instead she hoped that it would be able to support the work of living composers; and this is what the Foundation has done for nearly 30 years. We had talked at length about the possibility of funding recordings, and although it took a while to get NMC off the ground, I have always felt that the label was founded with her blessing, and that she would have approved whole-heartedly of what we have achieved since 1989."""

The Gramophone Magazine wrote regarding the first volume in the series: ""How many times have I regretted a shortage of fantasy, flair and fairy-tale imagination in recordings of the Prokofiev piano concertos? Well, here is a disc that takes all those qualities to the top."" Prokofiev’s Piano Concertos are among 20th century masterpieces. Upon reading the score of the 2nd Piano Concerto before its premiere, composer Nikolay Miaskovsky wrote to Prokofiev: ""When I was reading through your concerto tonight, lying in bed, I went almost crazy with admiration: I jumped and cried out, so that if I had neighbours, they’d have probably thought I’d gone mad."" Prokofiev wrote this magical work just before World War I. The original score was destroyed during the Russian revolution, and Prokofiev had to re-write the concerto in 1923. Prokofiev's Piano Concerto No. 5 is completely different in nature than its predecessors. A stylistic change towards simplicity is evident in the work. Although Prokofiev considered naming the work ""Music for Piano and Orchestra"" he produced in the end a challenging concerto that tests any soloist’s technique. Prokofiev himself gave the first performance in Berlin on 31 October 1932. Pianist Olli Mustonen has worked with most of the world’s leading orchestras, including the Berlin Philharmonic, New York Philharmonic and The Royal Concertgebouw, partnering conductors such as Ashkenazy, Barenboim, Dutoit, Eschenbach, Harnoncourt, Masur and Nagano. As a recitalist, he plays in all the significant musical capitals, including Mariinsky Theatre St Petersburg, Wigmore Hall, Beethoven-Haus Bonn, Symphony Center Chicago, New York Zankel Hall and Sydney Opera House. His many albums for Ondine include Respighi’s Concerto in modo Misolidio with Sakari Oramo and the Finnish Radio Symphony and a critically acclaimed disc of Scriabin’s solo piano music. The recent recordings by the Finnish Radio Symphony Orchestra under Hannu Lintu on Ondine have been a fruitful collaboration gathering excellent reviews in the international press."

Overshadowed by the monumental third and the dramatic fifth symphonies, Beethoven’s cheerful and optimistic fourth has been described as a “wolf in sheep’s clothing” for its mix of engaging melodies, lurching rhythms, pungent dissonances and its vigorous orchestral writing. While structurally and harmonically more complex than the first symphony, it too is cast in the classical mould with a palpable nod to Haydn in the rousing final movement. Rafael Kubelik recorded his acclaimed cycle of Beethoven symphonies in the 1970s for Deutsche Grammophon, each with a different orchestra to dazzling effect. Although recorded in multi-channel sound, these unmissable performances have previously been available only in the conventional two-channel stereo format. Using state of the art technology which avoids the need for re-mixing, PENTATONE’s engineers have remastered the original studio tapes to bring the performances to life as originally intended: in compelling and pristine multi-channel sound. Further releases from this memorable cycle are planned this year in the Remastered Classics series: Symphonies 2 & 5 (October) and Symphonies 6, 7 & 8 (November)."

Strauss’s bold and passionate tone poem Also Sprach Zarathustra is a riveting work, famous for its startlingly atmospheric opening. With a thrilling and florid orchestral score, it’s a work which Jurowski observes “…launches the whole idea of 20th century music. Written in the 19th century, this is one of those pieces which announces the new century to come.” It is paired with Mahler’s no less gripping Totenfeier which is an early version of the first movement of his Symphony No 2 “Resurrection”. “I find very interesting to compare [the two versions] …”, writes Jurowski, “In many ways, the Totenfeier is less accomplished , but far more honest and genuine.” Juxtaposing the Strauss and Mahler works in this way, Jurowski notes “Zarathustra is all about technical brilliance and accomplishment … in the Mahler the surfaces are much less polished, so there is much more aspiration to go into the depth of things.” Jurowski is one of today’s most sought-after conductors, widely praised for his adventurousness and incisive musicianship. He has made several critically acclaimed recordings for PENTATONE, including works by Shostakovich, Prokofiev and Tchaikovsky. For his recording with the Rundfunk-Sinfonieorchester Berlin of Schnittke’s Symphony No 3, BBC Music Magazine opined “Vladimir Jurowski…delivers an absolutely stunning account that vividly captures the work’s drama and emotional intensity.” “While discussing future projects with PENTATONE,” writes Jurowski “I said that having heard the Schnittke in such a brilliantly multi-dimensional way, I would like to hear a few pieces of the main repertoire recorded like this. The first one that came to mind was Zarathustra.” The Rundfunk-Sinfonieorchester Berlin is one of the leading orchestras in Berlin. Under former artistic director and chief conductor Marek Janowski, it has made numerous classic recordings with PENTATONE, including a critically acclaimed cycle of 10 Wagner operas. Upcoming releases on PENTATONE include Humperdinck’s Hansel und Gretel, and violin concertos by Britten and Hindemith with Arabella Steinbacher, conducted by Vladimir Jurowski."

After all, Heggie and Scheer’s hit 2010 opera Moby-Dick raised the same challenges: how could they remain faithful to the source material and still create something new, which emphasized the story’s innate operatic qualities? For It’s a Wonderful Life, Heggie and Scheer responded by keeping the basic plot and characters from the beloved Frank Capra film version but changing the perspective. As in the film, an angel—changed in the opera from Clarence to Clara—is assigned to help a man named George Bailey, who is despondent and contemplating taking his own life on Christmas Eve; if Clara succeeds, she will earn her wings. But in a departure from the film, all the action takes place from Clara’s perspective and in her realm. Seventy mirrored doors represent portals in time and space, which Clara uses to piece together the events of George’s life in an effort to understand what has brought him to this moment of despair. How well did Heggie and Scheer succeed? Critics said the “feel good” work (Opera Warhorses) “dispels any notion that you may have about expecting the opera to duplicate the film [and has a] crazy-quilt score that may be Heggie’s most delightful concoction” (Theater Jones). As the Houston Chronicle critic summed up, “George Bailey would be proud.”"

Handel wrote this sumptuous work in 1734 to celebrate the marriage in London of Princess Anne and Prince William of Orange. Cast in the form of a serenata, Parnasso in festa recounts the joyful wedding feast of Thetis and Peleus at which the Muses are present. It’s packed with breathtaking arias, duets and choruses, all written with the verve, drama and sense of occasion to be expected from Handel. The soloists that he had on hand for the premiere were among the greatest Italian singers of the day – Giovanni Carestini, Margherita Durastanti, Anna Maria Strada del Po and Maria Caterina Negri. The care he lavished on the richly instrumented score is striking, from the masterly reworking of material from his oratorio Athalia to the ravishing original material, making this work unique among Handel’s output. Parnasso in festa proved to be very popular in its day it and was revived several times, yet after 1741 was largely forgotten. Now after years of neglect, this superbly crafted work has been recognised for the glorious entertainment that it is. The renowned Baroque specialist Andrea Marcon is noted for his striking and vivid interpretations. Here he gives Parnasso in festa the attention it deserves with an outstanding vocal cast around his period-instrument group La Cetra. Opera News described Robin Johansen’s performance in the Netherlands premiere as “[a] revelation … superbly agile and fresh-sounding—but also expressive—in Clio’s taxing music.” The demanding role of Apollo is undertaken by the countertenor David Hansen, a rising star described by The New Yorker as “…a pure-voiced young Australian who is typical of a new breed of matinée-idol countertenors”. And a performance at the Handel Festival in 2014 drew rave reviews “Altogether, with the virtuosic playing of the inspired Cetra orchestra under Maestro Marcon, so finely balanced with the stunning chorus and soloists, this concert performance of an infrequently performed serenata became … one of the high points of the festival.” (Opera con Brio) It’s a sumptuous banquet for Handel lovers and opera enthusiasts and especially ‘fit for royalty’."

After a string of important and boundary-busting releases on Innova, ECM, and many other labels, this collection firmly establishes PRISM’s own XAS label, and offers a kind of “State of the Union” address for the saxophone quartet. The album title is also well-considered. If there ever was a paradigm for a saxophone quartet, PRISM has long since dispensed with it, through a radical re-examination of what the saxophone can do...and who it can do it with. The quartet has worked with choirs, chamber ensembles, jazz bands, and the weird and wild instrumentarium designed by Harry Partch. As it happens, the works on this album, whatever their origins, are simply for saxophone quartet, but they all come from a place of collaboration, with composers who reflect the musical and cultural diversity of 21st century America. The six composers featured on ""Paradigm Lost"" represent the pinnacle of excellence in new American music. Between them, they have received virtually every major composition award and fellowship, including the Pulitzer Prize for Music, Grawemeyer Award, Rome Prize, Grammy Award, Guggenheim and NEA fellowships, Charles Ives Living Award and Goddard Lieberson Award from the American Academy of Arts and Letters, Stoeger Prize from the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center, Kennedy Center Friedheim Award, and commissions from the Fromm, Naumburg, and Koussevitzky foundations.

His talent was recognized by Heinrich Neuhaus, the famous Russian piano teacher with German roots who included him in his master piano class at Moscow Conservatory in 1937. Neuhaus’s influence can hardly be overestimated. He trained him in enormously subtle dynamics, pronouncedly Romantic playing with certain composers and great reserve with others.

The album is a revue of Rouse’s chamber music from the last two decades and beyond, and the works featured on MORPHIC RESONANCE demonstrate Rouse’s powerful gifts to create compelling and idiosyncratic musical statements. This quality is most prominent in the work Ten Little Things, a set of short movements for clarinet and percussion. More appropriately, Rouse uses the work to pair solo clarinet with different pitched and unpitched percussion instruments, and he succeeds brilliantly in blending the clarinet’s sound with unlikely partners, such as the tambourine and snare drum, among others. Ten Little Things is endlessly impressive, as each movement sounds like a new world, thanks to Rouse’s willingness to explore the full color palette of the clarinet, namely through microtones, and his disciplined construction of melodic and rhythmic material. Across MORPHIC RESONANCE, Rouse displays the highest level of compositional ability, particularly in the unexpected ways he bases seemingly complex passages on repeated melodic and rhythmic ideas. This technique is critical to the success of Ten Little Things as it further links the clarinet and percussion in the common purpose of the movement, underscoring their total partnership in the music. In Form Fades, for flute, clarinet, cello, violin, piano, and percussion, Rouse demonstrates a winning approach to ensemble writing. Scored for a notably disparate group of instruments, Rouse unites them, at first with a shared melody, throughout with brilliant orchestration. Rouse’s treatment of the ensemble not only connects its components, but also energizes and brings unexpected earthiness to the whole ensemble, which, in the history of twentieth and twenty-first century music, is most commonly associated with intricate, delicate, and erudite compositions. A hidden gem on MORPHIC RESONANCE is Nevolution, Rouse’s duo for corno da caccia – a historical brass instrument dating back to the Baroque period – and piano. Once again, Rouse succeeds in transcending the difficulties of unusual instrumentation and creates an entirely unique, entirely personal, and entirely compelling composition. Most stunning is Nevolution’s middle movement, which is slow and lyrical, showing the tenderness that is also part of Rouse’s musical language. This album is replete with unusual combinations of instruments, particularly in Ten Little Things and Nevolution. Consider how Rouse is able to exploit these pairings and ‘normalize’ them, as it were, into his regular musical language. Although Rouse’s music tends towards intricate and complex ideas, he often employs repetition to make his works more straightforward. Listen for this and consider how this disciplined approach helps to make his music more compelling"

He is widely recognized and acknowledged for his dramatic and engaging music, often using innovative instrumentation. Walicki was one of the first composers to use turntables in his music. Walicki conveys the effects of globalization and increasing dependency on technology with CYBERISTAN, a Ravello Records release. Each piece contains its own environment and its own space. The natural acoustic sounds juxtaposed against man-made sounds of electronic instrumentation supports a dichotomy of two worlds vying for supremacy but inevitably merging into one homogenous identity. The compositions invoke many aspects of such a state, such as the spacious elegance of Black Water and the eponymous Cyberistan, the airy and hopeful Sabah, the verbose call and response of the bass and electronics in Light and a more primal piece, nada Brahma, commissioned and composed for the Kronos Quartet. Walicki brilliantly captures the awe of the exotic and contrasts it elegantly with the foreboding nature of modernity.

Completing the album are the expansive Missa Wellensis and Joubert’s vivid and powerful setting of Lucis iste. The Wells Cathedral Choir was hailed in 2011 by an international jury from Gramophone Magazine as the greatest choir with children in the world, and the sixth greatest overall. The choir celebrated its 1100th birthday in 2009: boys sang first at Wells Cathedral in 909 and the full choral tradition dates back over 800 years. In 1994 the choral foundation at Wells was enriched by the addition of girl choristers. Today the choir consists of 18 boy choristers, 18 girl choristers, and 12 Vicars Choral.

There are two bonus tracks, previously released, that come from the Bell Telephone Hour with Donald Voorhees conducting in Radio City, New York in February 1950. The Evorak is tightly coiled, cloaked and hooded, full of inimitable tonal splendor and not remotely relaxed while the Sarasate Habanera is suave and bewitching.

Take for example Michael Praetorius’ (1571-1621) beautiful setting of Es ist ein Ros entsprungen, which is juxtaposed against a new arrangement by Paul Mealor (b. 1975). Early music in a new guise can also be found in Gaudate, Christus est natus and O Heiland,reiß die Himmel auf as well as in the medieval hymn Ave Maris Stella, which Ivo Antognini (b. 1963) specifically reset to music for the choir.

Scott Wyatt’s “…and nature is alone” memorializes the Chernobyl nuclear power station disaster in 1986. Elena Filatova, who wrote the text, and ValerieSobol, who performs the text, both have personal connections to Chernobyl and their inclusion intensifies the cathartic nature of the work. Eli Fieldsteel’s work includes extensive investigation into music generated by microcontrollers. Using motion-sensitive resistors and sensor gloves in collaboration with the open source platform Arduino, Fieldsteel fashions a musical vocabulary that corresponds to his arsenal of physical gestures. ‘Brain Candy’ is the fruit of those efforts. Pianist and composer Keith Kirchoff’s ‘Irrational Rationalities’ is inspired by the work of cubist painter Alvin Loving. Loving’s paintings use tricks of the eye to embed visual contraditions within seemingly simple elements. Kirchoff strives to achieve a similar sleight of hand in music, combining three distinct thematic ideas in such a way that they are taken out of context and challenge a passive listening experience. Becky Brown’s ‘Hold Still’ is a multi-disciplinary work combining poetry, drawings, video, and electronics processing. Benjamin D. Whiting’s ‘Illumina!

As a little boy, he used to be quite at home in the Brahmshaus, which was Brahms’s place of residence in Ruschlikon at Lake Zurich in the summer of 1874. During his childhood, it was where his grandparents lived, and their pride in living in such a historic house was passed on to him. Before becoming a member of the Zurich Tonhalle Orchestra, he lived in Baden-Baden where Brahms composed his Opus 40, which has become a constant part of Mischa Greul’s repertoire. Beethoven’s Opus 17 sonata for piano and horn could be interpreted as the dialogue of a married couple. Schumann‘s Adagio and Allegro Opus 70 is all about the fusion of sound. For many horn players it is considered a unique jewel of the horn repertoire.

Johann Sebastian Bach made one of his most profound affirmations, a Gradus ad Parnassum, which in six stages sets out an intellectual and technical challenge that is and will probably remain peerless in the history of music for our instrument. My colleague and friend, Prof. Peter Langgartner from the Mozarteum University of Salzburg pointed out to me that the Prelude of the first suite contains Luther’s chorale “Vom Himmel hoch, da komm’ ich her” (from Heaven above, from thence I come). I had always presumed so and was grateful for confirmation that the cello suites make allusions to chorales and religious messages. I have therefore found a musical way of opening a spiritual door to the suites and added chorales to Suites 1, 3, and 5 in the mould of sounds from John Cage’s work One 8, chorales that in my opinion are definitely consistent with messages conveyed in the suites. I find that John Cage’s music shares similarities with Bach’s. His music allows for inner reflection, providing a contemplative point of calm. Cage said the purpose of music is “to cleanse the soul and bring it peace, thus making it amenable to divine influences”.

Enescu’s Third Sonata is a wholly personal creation, played by Nicola Meecham with brilliant dexterity and musical devotion.” (Bryce Morrison, Gramophone) This is just one of the superlative reviews which greeted Nicola Meecham’s album for SOMM of works by Kodaly, Enescu and Janacek. We now welcome her back in a fabulous recital of piano music by Tchaikovsky which includes the two rarely performed or recorded Piano Sonatas. The large-scale, majestic Grande Sonate in G major Op. 37, Tchaikovsky’s most significant work for solo piano, and the earlier Sonata in C sharp minor of 1865. The G major sonata was published during Tchaikovsky’s lifetime, having been written in 1878. The work opens with a magnificent chordal gesture and an initial richly inventive theme, which is threaded through and across all four movements. In both sonatas, Tchaikovsky is in total command of his chosen structure and develops his ideas with great originality and ease. The effective keyboard writing apparent in both works betokens a composer thoroughly at home in the medium. The present release includes four of Tchaikovsky’s shorter solo pieces, the Nocturne and Feuillet d’album, Opus 19 and the Humoresque Op. 10 No. 2, all of which strengthened his reputation as a distinctive composer of solo piano pieces. The delightful Doumka in C minor paints a picture akin to a rustic Russian scene and is one of the finest of all of Tchaikovsky’s shorter solo piano works."

Our programme ranges from some of the most famous names in music to those best-known in other areas of the art - and has been carefully chosen to present a uniquely fascinating conspectus of piano music by British composers of the last 100 years. There are such rarities as Benjamin Britten's brilliant early suite 'Holiday Diary', the great composer in lighter mood, and the magnificent virtuoso set of Six Studies for Piano by Kenneth Leighton, alongside a rare collection of Impressionist pieces by Gustav Holst - showing him to be as much a master of the keyboard as his 'Planets' suite is of the orchestra. John Ireland (Britten's teacher) is represented by his haunting Ballade of London Nights, and we have a significant premiere recording of Ireland's most famous song - Sea Fever - arranged for solo piano by Roderick Williams, best-known as one of the finest of all living British singers, now appearing on disc in a new light. Both the world premiere Goodwood-by-the-Sea and the piano arrangement of Sea Fever were written by Roderick Williams especially for Maria Marchant and dedicated to her. Ronald Stevenson's 'Peter Grimes Fantasy' takes us back to Benjamin Britten - a wonderful homage from one major British composer to another."
DOR         ,SONO LUMINUS,SLE-70010,53479701022,"Narroway, Richard","Bach, Johann Sebastian","Bach: 6 Cello Suites, BWV 1007-1012",COMPACT DISC,2,13.25,20.99,2017,"Bach’s Six Cello Suites There are a few iconic works in the core repertory with a special quality that makes them instantly recognizable, even after hearing just a few notes. The first G major Cello Suite is one of them. I like to think of the opening measures as a kind of entrance into the sound world of the cello; the open strings lift our spirits, resonating with the quintessential voice and depth of sonority we all know and love. It is so simple in its design, but so far-reaching in its vision, almost as if Bach is on a quest to discover the true potential of this instrument that has for too long been left in the background. As such, a feeling of birth and youthful discovery permeates the mood of this opening suite—a blissful disregard of any trials to come. And yet at the same time one gets the sensation that this is just the beginning of a larger journey. Richard’s Approach: “For this recording, I use a modern setup: specifically a 1930 Carl Becker cello made in Chicago, and a modern bow. I admit that such a setup is quite far off from the sound world that Bach must have imagined when composing these suites. I have done my best, however, to balance this modern setup with a thorough understanding of Baroque stylistic principles, particularly in regard to sound production, bow strokes, vibrato, slurring, voicing, and ornaments. I think nowadays, our performance decisions tend to be too black and white; one either performs with total commitment to historical performance practice (by using gut strings, a baroque bow, lower tuning and no endpin) or one forgets all about it. I don’t think it is so simple! There is plenty of room, I think, to combine an understanding of historical stylistic principles with current trends in modern performance practice. It is by no means as simple as choosing one way or the other. I think ultimately, regardless of what kind of setup one uses, how much one vibrates and so on, the most important thing is that the spirit of the music comes to life, which is often more a matter of phrasing, sound, character, tempo and attention to harmony, than of specific issues of Baroque tuning and style. The very fact that Bach’s suites can still reveal their secrets through so many varied approaches is a testament to the genius of this music. This is not to say that one should disregard any helpful musicological research that sheds light on performing traditions of the time. On the contrary, I think this is absolutely essential! There is nothing wrong with informing ourselves if the goal is to become more convincing, thoughtful artists. The information is there; why ignore it? At any rate, this kind of knowledge should not be confining. Rather, it should liberate us, for it offers an opportunity to open our minds and creative palettes to more colors and possibilities.” Recognized for his stylistic versatility and wide-ranging musical interests, Australian cellist Richard Narroway has proven himself to be equally at home with repertoire both new and old. He has appeared as a soloist with the Grand Rapids Symphony and the HanZhou Philharmonic Orchestra, and in recital on Chicago’s WFMT Dame Myra Hess Series and the Keys to the City Piano Festival at Chicago’s Symphony Center. In addition he has given performances in Australia, China, Germany, Canada and the United States, in prestigious venues such as the Kennedy Center, Chicago Symphony Center, Preston Bradley Hall and the Sydney Opera House."

The accompanying booklets are considered models of research and total almost 400 pages. One of these releases, Canticles of Ecstasy, received several international awards (including an Edison Prize, a Disque d’Or, and a Grammy nomination for best choral recording) and has sold more than a million copies worldwide. In 2009 an anthology was released, containing exceptional tracks from six of Sequentia’s Hildegard recordings on DHM. In 2012 the final recording of the complete works, Celestial Hierarchy, was brought to life by Sequentia’s co-founder and director Benjamin Bagby, to commemorate the elevation of Hildegard von Bingen to Sainthood and Doctor Ecclesiae (2011), to finish Sequentia’s complete works project on the DHM/Sony label and thus to honor the life’s work of Barbara Thornton. For this recording, a multi-generational ensemble of seven women’s voices was assembled under Bagby’s direction, together with the flautist Norbert Rodenkirchen and Bagby playing harp. One of the singers on this final recording had been a member of Barbara Thornton’s ensemble, while some others were not yet born when the first recording was made in 1982."

An astute interpreter, a sensuous singer on the keyboard, one who plumbs the notes fully yet treats each one with love and intelligent solicitude. Coinciding with the pianists 90th birthday later this year, Sony Classical is pleased to announce the first CD release of Badura-Skodas complete recording of the Schubert sonatas, an LP collectors item ever since its original publication in 1971. Born on 6 October 1927 in Vienna, Paul Badura-Skoda studied there at the Conservatory and later with the legendary pianist Edwin Fischer in Switzerland. In 1949, the still-unknown young artist was engaged as soloist by both Wilhelm Furtwängler and Herbert von Karajan for their concerts in Vienna. His international breakthrough came in 1950 when he substituted on short notice for his ailing mentor, Edwin Fischer. That same year he began recording for the new vinyl LP medium. Three years later, when he made his New York debut, American music lovers still knew Badura-Skoda only from his records; yet the recital attracted a capacity audience. Encouraged by the Vienna-born RCA Victor executive George Marek, Badura-Skoda recorded all of Franz Schuberts sonatas including his own completions of several works left unfinished by the composer between May 1967 and May 1971. A few of the sessions (which were produced by the incomparable Max Wilcox) took place in New York at RCA Recording Studio A, but most were held in the Vienna studios of Westminster Records president James Grayson. Badura-Skoda then was playing on a modern grand piano. In the 1990s, this ever-enterprising artist whose remarkable recording career continues to this day would remake the Schubert cycle using his own fortepianos. When RCA released the complete set of sonatas on 13 LPs at the end of 1971, the Gramophone reviewer showered Badura-Skodas interpretations with praise: As a fellow Viennese he has the style in his blood and loves the music. Nothing is over-driven or inflated. Schubert for him is no would-be Beethoven: he conveys the musics relaxed lyricism, its basic simplicity, emphasizing romantic dreams more than the stern, classical sonata heritage. Now this very special set is available again, newly remastered from the original analogue masters for its first CD appearance as a 12-disc box. Paul Badura-Skodas Schubert is a must-have for lovers of great piano music, performed with the utmost love and understanding."

Ma and Ax have built together a distinguished catalogue of Brahms recordings, but this is their first recording of the Piano Trios – and their first collaboration with Kavakos. Of the three Brahms Piano Trios - Trio No. 1 in B Major, Op. 8; Trio No. 2 in C Major, Op. 87; and Trio No. 3 in C Minor, Op. 101 – the Second and Third Trios were written and first performed in quick succession (1882 and 1883), both examples of Brahms at his creative zenith. The same can be said of the First Trio: originally completed when he was twenty, in 1854, and premiered the following year, Brahms thoroughly rethought and revised it in a new version premiered early in 1890. That more elegant and concentrated version of a youthful work has become the standard for the First Trio, and it is the version performed on the recording by Ma, Ax and Kavakos. All three performers have been acclaimed for their interpretations of Brahms, as soloists and as colleagues. Between them, Ma and Ax have shared four Grammy Awards® for their recordings of Brahms’s chamber music.

The whole world mourned the loss one of its most cherished celebrities. Pavarottis unmistakable voice with its open Italianate sound and ringing upper register was ideal for the operas of Verdi, Bellini, Donizetti and Puccini, but also the popular Italian and other repertoire that he and his admirers revelled in. Combined with his generous, charismatic personality, his thrilling vocalism made him into an icon, as famous as the rock stars he loved to perform with. Pavarotti made only a handful of recordings for Sony Classical, but they occupy a unique place in his discography. An album of Verdi rarities, newly remastered from the original analog tapes, with Claudio Abbado conducting the Orchestra of La Scala, Milan, includes arias composed for Attila, Ernani and Les vepres siciliennes as well as a recently discovered cabaletta from I due Foscari and an early fragment from an uncompleted opera, Il solitario ed Eloisa. Gramophone acclaimed the release, praising the tenors remarkably polished renditions, always generous in provision of voice and spirit Fine performances, both vocal and orchestral. Another CD rarity is the live recording Luciano Pavarotti in Concert, which brought the great tenor to Modenas Piazza Grande on 14 August 1985 for his first-ever concert in his native city. Needless to say, it was a joyous occasion. Joined by the Arturo Toscanini Symphony Orchestra of Emilia Romagna, conducted by Emerson Buckley, the international superstar serenaded his adoring fellow Modenesi with a programme of his greatest hits, including the most popular tenor arias from Lucia di Lammermoor, Rigoletto, Luisa Miller, La Bohème, Turandot, Fedora and Pagliacci plus, of course, such indispensable Italian songs as O sole mio, Torna a Surriento, Non ti scordar di me, Rondine al nido, Mamma and a heartfelt salute to Modena, Alla mia citta. In December 1999, Pavarotti was joined for a Christmas concert at the Vienna Konzerthaus by his great colleagues Plácido Domingo and José Carreras (they, as we all know, became the legendary Three Tenors when the world thrilled to their collaboration on the eve of the Word Cup Final at the Roman Baths of Caracalla on 7 July 1990).

It is jazz with a special bluesy and folksy Nordic sound and a characteristic mix of grandeur and minimalism. Sigurdur Flosason plays the alto saxophone and he says the following about the new record “The music on this CD is inspired by the highlands of the country that raised me, my native Iceland. The desert-like wasteland holds a singular kind of beauty. Perhaps not pretty in the usual sense of the word, it is beautiful in its stark and rough contrasts. There, beauty lies in the small, in the slow-growing moss with its endless hues of colour, in the black sand stretching as far as the eye can see, in the fragile highland growth and the fresh spring water quietly streaming forth from beneath majestic lava fields. The music is my dedication to the heart of my country and the people who brought me there, my parents.” Icelandic beauty is the weather capable of changing in the blink of an eye; it is in the stillness and in the storm; in the rain falling at a slant, sometimes almost horizontally; in the sky that has colours you see nowhere else; green when visited by the Aurora Borealis. And then there is the ever present moon, there at the end of the world. This hushed yet ferocious type of beauty is explored on Green Moss Black Sand. Along with the Lars Jansson Trio, Flosason captures the Nordic nuances with fervour and precision. Lars Jansson is a Swedish jazz pianist and a composer, and the Lars Jansson Trio counts Jansson as well as the Dane Thomas Fonnesbæk on double bass, and the Swede Paul Svanberg on drums. Flosason is from Iceland and is trained as a classical alto saxophonist. Although he primarily plays jazz, he has worked extensively with various Scandinavian musicians such as Cathrine Legardh, Kjeld Lauritsen, and Kristian Leth, and has composed both jazz music and classical pieces. The musicianship, generosity and friendship of the group make the musical images of rural Iceland come to life."

Louis Armstrong himself thanked him in his old age for bringing forward the very music to which Armstrong himself had vowed his whole life. He had an ear for rhythm and music like no other. His sound is a demonstration of power, but never extortion. Rather, he is precise, athletically sharp and just a moment ahead of the beat, laid-back and superior. He wasn’t interested in sheet music or chords, but had an ear and a routine equal to few. For Davison, it was not a question of which playing style was in fashion: he was driven by a simple desire to create good music. It wasn’t only his musical style that earned him his Wild Bill nickname. He loved partying and was known to drink like an entire band. He could be gruff and violent, tender and touching, generous or stingy. His fifth and last wife, Ann Stewart, put him under and administration and that diminished the number of female acquaintances and his consumption of boozed dwindled to a trickle. But how did this musician from the great USA turn up in Denmark, settle here and play so prolifically for five years? The story begins at the 1972 Newport Jazz Festival. Papa Bue’s Viking Jazzband was on the program, and went backstage to say hello to musicians such as Eddie Condon, Bobby Hackett among others. They invite Davison to Copenhagen, and he likes the city so much he decides to stay around. Ole “Fessor” Lindgreen recalls Wild Bill Davisons particular and powerful style: “I’ve played with many of the Americans, but I have to say I was always impressed by the punch there was in Wild Bill. No matter whether he was playing for forty people or four hundred, there was an enormous amount of power. If the concert was being recorded, the sound people always thought there was something wrong with the equipment – that’s how strong he played. The fact that later in the evening he drank himself stinking drunk didn’t matter so much… He was more serious with his music than you’d think, behind that smash-bang-pow façade. He practiced all the time. He said ‘I have the kind of chops that, if I don’t practice one day, it’s okay. Two days, problems. Three days, serious shit’”. Wild Bill Davison lived the good life in Denmark for more than five years, between 1973 and 1978. He played countless gigs with Danish bands, especially Fessor’s Big City Band and Papa Bue’s Viking Jazzband, and made trips to Argentina, Spain and Italy with Copenhagen as his base. The music in this box set focuses on his successful collaboration with the Danish bands, who are performing on a high level with deep, affectionate insight into the essence of jazz."

He drew inspiration from the finest instrumentalists of his time. Victory in the prestigious competition in Vienna (1937) launched his international career as a soloist. Following his debut at the Prague Spring festival in May 1951, he would pay numerous visits to the city – to appear at the festival, to perform opposite the Czech Philharmonic, as well as to record for Supraphon. The present release is the first complete issue of the 19 studio albums Navarra made for the label between 1953 and 1966, including some remarkable tracks that have not been previously issued digitally. His collaboration with Karel Ancerl and Josef Suk gave rise to the legendary recording of Brahms’s Double Concerto, with the accounts of pieces by Prokofiev, Bloch, Schumann and Respighi made with the Czech Philharmonic under Ancerl being just as impressive and enthralling. In addition to Josef Suk, Navarra worked with the superlative pianists Alfred Holecek and Frantisek Maxian. The Supraphon set includes six hours of sensitively remastered recordings, which bear witness to Navarra’s artistry, emotional poignancy and spontaneous musicianship; a real treat for those loving the enchanting cello timbres.

This legendary sound laboratory for jazz of the SWR was founded in 1966 by Joachim-Ernst Berendt and takes place every year. The idea: musicians who always wanted to perform with one another but who, for a variety of reasons, have so far not been able to do so, develop a concert programme in the broadcaster’s studios that the SWR then presents in several concerts in its transmission area. In the course of its fifty-year history, the SWR NEWJazz Meeting has in this way served as a driving force for new trends in jazz. “I see a particular value in exploring the music of my South African homeland and making it fit for the future.” Kyle Shepherd, born in 1987, is the most innovative and important pianist of the contemporary South African jazz scene. His sound boldly makes reference to the roots of township jazz and the Goema Beat of his hometown of Cape Town. Nevertheless, he refuses to be put into a pigeonhole; his horizon extends far beyond his beloved Cape Jazz. “It’s cool to choose the African thing in conceptual questions. But just as cool to choose something else.” Kyle Shepherd, the most innovative and important pianist of the contemporary South African jazz scene, is the curator of the 2016 SWR NEWJazz Meeting. At his wish, four young jazz musicians from South Africa and the Benin-born guitarist and singer Lionel Loueke (who since 2001 has been living in the United States) met in November 2016 at the SWR’s Baden-Baden radio studios. The musicians named their project “Sound Portraits From Contemporary Africa”. The African improvisers experimented for five days and developed a concert programme that they then presented on a tour in the SWR broadcasting area."

It was clearly conceived, however, for the keyboard, an idiom for which this work is a masterpiece, both in regard to contrapuntal technique and to the exceedingly refined art and skill of harpsichord and organ writing. The interdependence of these two books is underlined by their publishing history already beginning with the second edition of the Capricci of 1626, and continuing for the later ones of 1628 and 1642. The first editions of the Ricercari (1615 and 1618) included five canzonas, after which the planned “second book” in actuality took on such particular characteristics that Frescobaldi decided to give the work its own title, that of “Capricci”: “In these compositions entitled Capricci, I have not kept to as simple a style as in my Ricercari.” Once again, by Frescobaldi’s own admission in his dedication to the Modenese prince Alfonso d’Este, the guiding hand of Luzzaschi is to be found at the origin of this work: “I owe to Your Highness, as Prince, who from birth has retained from his ancestors the ancient and hereditary protection of the arts, the fruit of these musical labors to which I dedicated myself in my early years under the discipline of Signor Luzzasco, most rare organist and dearest servant of the Most Serene House of Este.”"

He was not a lover of fame: indeed, it took Padre Martini a great deal of time and convincing before managing to obtain a portrait of Tartini for his private collection (this original portrait, painted by Vincenzo Rota, is the only one we have today). Despite all this, however, young musicians arrived from all over Europe to study with this musician who, essentially self-taught, had dedicated his life to perfecting the violin from both a technical and theoretical standpoint. In the not insignificant output of this “Master of Nations” (as he was called), the violin predominates, for Tartini composed few works other than the concertos and sonatas dedicated to this noble instrument. The justification for this choice may be found in his theoretical writings, which represented for the eighteenth century a new moment of discovery and evolution. Implored by many to compose for the opera in Venice, he responded that “a throat is not a neck of a violin,” and this comment was followed by a strong criticism of Vivaldi, who instead tried his hand at virtually every genre. This album features the concertos for flute, for strings, and various sonatas including the famous “Trillo del Diavolo.” The two soloists Massimo Mercelli and Marco Rogliano are accompanied by the Ensemble Respighi from Bologna."

Soon he became the major reference of his time for consulting, tests and inaugurations of new organs.

We should mention first of all the periods he spent in the Basilica of San Marco in Venice, and those in the employment of Duke Wolfgang Wilhelm von Pfalz-Neuburg. He was also active, for shorter periods, not only in his native Brescia, but also in Parma, Milan, Brussels, Bergamo, Padua, Ferrara, and Vicenza. Today Marini is remembered essentially for his contribution to the development of the seventeenth-century instrumental repertoire. To put it briefly, he is appreciated because of two main achievements: that of having taken part in the early definition of the trio-sonata genre, and that of having decisively contributed to the development of the violin technique.

We undoubtedly should add to all this that a typically bourgeois taste led proficient “amateurs” to take pleasure in delightfully playing all sorts of musical instruments and performing, among other things, an original repertoire that was not bound to opera music but influenced by it. Claudio Ortensi’s flute and Anna Pasetti’s harp take this world back to us through this premiere recording of the works by Michelangelo Sola, Giovanni Toja, Angelo Bovio and Giuseppe Gariboldi, active protagonists of the European and Italian compositional streams converging chamber music with the political and cultural trends that crossed the Classicism and the Romanticism."

Recorded in Toronto at Koerner Hall and George Weston Recital Hall between 2004 and 2016, these performances chart Tafelmusik’s evolution as it expanded its repertoire to explore the music of classical and early romantic composers.

Maestro Weil also directed the orchestra in international performances of Beethoven symphonies at the Klang und Raum Festival in Irsee, Germany, during its 19-year tenure there as orchestra-in-residence. Much admired by the international music press, Tafelmusik’s Beethoven interpretations have been praised for their “transparency of articulation and balance … remarkable precision, vitality and tonal focus. Beethoven benefits mightily from the silken strings, woodsy winds, clarion brasses and pinpoint timpani” (Gramophone Magazine). “We approach the Beethoven concerts and recording as if they were the very first performances, as though the music had been composed yesterday. There’s no sense of routine with Tafelmusik musicians and everybody’s playing with a full heart and a full soul and spirit. That is the secret to a great performance,” - Bruno Weil. “Although the Beethoven symphonies are familiar to many music lovers, few have had the privilege to experience them as Tafelmusik and Bruno Weil have over the past many years.

TYX         ,TYXART,TXA17094,4.2507E+12,"Laporev, Ilia; Laporev Jr., Ilia; Moroz, Dasha","Groslot, Robert",Robert Groslot: Chamber Works,COMPACT DISC,1,14.81,22.99,2017,"Robert Groslot’s music reveals the complex personality of the composer, pianist, and conductor born in Mechelen, Belgium, in 1951. The three works recorded here- empathically interpreted by the two cellists, Ilia Yourivich Laporev and Ilia Laporev jr., and pianist Dasha Moroz- point to each other through their connection to spoken language, something that is also reflected in a few of the titles. Groslot takes his inspiration from images, in which a line is equal to writing a musical phrase, but a color can serve just as well to create a harmony. His fascination for puzzles forms the overarching structure for it all. But above all, his passion for language has led to intriguing writings that make his personal style recognizable. Because Groslot starts with improvisation, his music sounds like an intuitive language with a logical development, which is always audibly recognizable for the listener. In terms of melody, he thinks in musical phrases- just like in a spoken conversation- which can be suddenly interrupted or overlap each other internally. This “conversational technique” is the leitmotif through his body of work and also resounds through his titles."

They are found battered and bruised from their long journey by a man and his wife. The married couple is in the midst of a financial crisis, they seem to have grown far apart from one another in this marriage, and the unspoken aggression between them is palpable; nevertheless, Mr. and Mrs. X.E. set out to nurse the wounded angels back to health: they bathe them, wash the dirt from their nails... then lock them in a room, leaving them a claw foot bathtub for a shared bed, and decide to exploit these magical beings for wealth and personal gains."

Bach, each of the works on this recording is in some way related to light’s presence in our life journey: from birth to death, through love, disappointment, forgiveness, and transcendence. The presented repertoire spans the mystical 12th-century chant of Hildegard von Bingen through the Renaissance and Baroque eras, plus two special 19th century works by composers who were deeply inspired by the ideas and musical styles of these earlier time periods. Westminster Kantorei has been honored as a national finalist for The American Prize, whose judges praised the ensemble’s “finely-measured and delicate balance of voices, and a mastery of stylistic performance practice.” It has performed at the Boston Early Music Festival, the American Handel Festival and the Reformation 500 Anniversary Concert as well as in England and France, where it performed at the Festival Musique en L’ile in Paris. The ensemble has also collaborated with the Westminster Choir to perform Bach’s St. Matthew Passion with the New York Philharmonic, conducted by Kurt Masur."

Especially the voice of Hermes FernAndez Salgado from the Trío Tesis, the unusual, touching, glittering musical interaction of the singer Roxana Brínguez with the guitarrist Manuel SuArez Silva, and the heartbreaking Dúo Cachibache wakes up the deep longings to bring alive these songs with a sapphire or diamond stylus on a 180g LP-Vinyl. Mariko Takahashi and Stefan Winter have created a seemingly simple and fascinating poetic treasure box of sounds which they found in the backyards, narrow streets and bars of Havana. The graphic designer Gunter Mattei captured with his colorful illustrations the memorable scenes and key moments from this musical journey in booklets normally used by Cuban people to get butter, bread and other essential things in life. This album — in a gatefold cover — stands out well from the usual styled Cuban releases. With ""Cuadernos de La Habana“ the listener can enjoy with closed eyes a journey into a secret world of Havana and discover moving and touching sounds."
