He then spent two years studying in Amsterdam with Gustav Leonhardt, who subsequently invited him to perform under his direction.

Whereas Haydn’s Sonata Hob.XVI:32 (1776) aims for a classical but vigorous style, Hob.XVI:48, composed only four years later, is more subdued and academic.

The recent increase in attention paid to Saint-Saëns’ oeuvre is at least in part due to the wealth of recordings that are available today. His musical language combined the formal rigor of the German tradition, from Bach to Schumann, with a deep knowledge of the music of his native country from the Baroque period onwards and the clarity, elegance and esprit that only a French composer is capable of. Not without reason, he has been described as a classicist who knew how to entertain in a stimulating fashion.

Born in Silesia in the middle of the Thirty Years’ War which was then ravaging Europe, he was taught by his father, who was a musician in the local ducal court. By the age of 12 young Esiaias had entered the service of the Swedish general Count Wittenberg as a page. Having moved around Europe in the employ of several aristocrats, he settled back in his home region by the age of 20 as lutenist to Georg III, Duke of Silesia. He retained this position for another 20 years before moving to Leipzig and then Berlin, where he died in 1679.  His cosmopolitan life is reflected in the international character of his surviving compositions: he was the first German composer to write for the French 11-course lute, and in the style brise of elegant, broken chords associated with the masterpieces of Couperin. There are two collections, of which William Waters presents the first, Delitiae Testudinis, oder Erfreuliche Lauten-Lust, published in 1667 and then in two revised editions. There are 10 suites here, and they reflect the pleasure and relief he sought from the violence and conflict around him: ‘ever since my youth the soft and sweet sonority of noble music that quickens the spirit has been my only amusement and pleasure, and thereto I have sacrificed the greater part of my time with the lute.’ A course of study with the pioneering lutenist Hopkinson Smith changed the course of William Waters’ career. Having trained as a guitarist, he redirected his energies towards the vibrant culture of early music and became a founding member of two significant Catalan early-music ensembles, The Byrd Consort of Viols and the Liaison Ensemble. He is also a member of the Paris-based Lachrimae Consort.

Outside the constraints of the Parisian conservatoire tradition, he developed an idiom way ahead of its time compared to many of his contemporaries; indeed, while Edgard Varese was ploughing his furrow, Jolivet was his only European pupil between 1929 and 1933. However, Varese-like acerbity and austerity is out of place here. Jolivet was never less than a skilled melodist, and one who wrote for his chosen instruments rather than against them. Much that is here such as a sensuous Flute Sonata, a muscular Violin Sonata or a jocular Suite for oboe and piano is pitched, to ears unfamiliar with Jolivet, in an idiom somewhere between Poulenc, Messiaen and Dutilleux; but that’s the voice of Jolivet, and closer acquaintance with this set will accustom listeners to it in all its unpredictable, quicksilver charm. The Flute Sonata has received several recordings in the company of the likes of Poulenc and Koechlin, but there is much here that will be unfamiliar to even the most dedicated discophiles and followers of French musical fashions: an Ouverture en Rondeau for 4 ondes martenot, piano & percussion, for example, or the Petite Suite for string quintet, piano and percussion.  Few of the individual pieces or movements are of any great length – Jolivet knew the value of succinct expression like many French musicians of his generation– but there is a ten-minute Nocturne for cello and piano, and a rhapsodic Chant de Linos for flute and piano of the same length. The later music is especially intriguing, once Jolivet had found for himself a new form of classicism aimed at synthesizing serial and freely atonal music together with modal developments.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=BRI95275,Classical,Germany,2017 Brilliant Classics,2017 Brilliant Classics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

His parents were both jazz musicians and he grew up in a household where, as he says, ‘Benny Goodman and Mozart were not separated’. There is a corresponding harmony between traditional and modern idioms in his own music. Both written in 1977, Phrygian Gates and its briefer pendant or companion, China Gates, were game-changers for the course of Adams’s music.

Here is the work of another, hardly less significant figure, Heinrich Scheidemann. He wrote almost exclusively for organ, and in the expected forms of chorale fantasias, motet arrangements, preludes, toccatas and fantasias which constituted the bread and butter of the 17th-century church musician’s diet.  On this newly recorded album, the French organist Joseph Rassam plays a selection of all these genres, juxtaposed for maximum variety. In fact Scheidemann invented the genre of chorale fantasia, later so refined and developed by J.S. Bach, where a well-known chorale melody is played as the soprano line and reworked by means of superimposition, canon and imitation for the effects of grandeur and spiritual elevation. There are several Praeambulum movements in which Scheidemann builds on the legacy of the Dutch master Sweelinck, more freely composed, allowing full rein for the performer/composer’s own virtuosity. Until quite recently, all Scheidemann’s keyboard works were thought to have been written for the organ, but scholarly research has now shown that more than a quarter of the hundred or so pieces known to be by Scheidemann (or attributed to him) were actually written for the harpsichord and intended for performance in a secular context. Joseph Rassam’s recording is therefore one of the first to place such pieces in their original, intended context. In doing so, it reveals new and extrovert facets of the music which was hitherto characterised as more solemn and monumental according to an eccelesiastical context. Joseph Rassam has chosen to use three instruments appropriate to the historical and stylistic context of Scheidemann’s music. The organ is a relatively new one, inaugurated in 2010 by Gustav Leonhardt in the church of St Martin, Amilly, and built by Bertrand Cattiaux in the style of North-German Baroque instruments. He also plays an original 17th-century harpsichord of unknown manufacture, beautifully decorated and recently restored by Alain Anselm, and one of Anselm’s own virginals.

Landscape and the evocation of a place, a sense of home, has been a central element to English music for more than a century, and these four composers reflect those concerns through the prism of an instrument connecting them, and us, back to nature and to an idealised rustic past. A gentle, almost Minimalist opening to Edmund Rubbra’s Sonata opens out to a characteristically long-limbed and reflective melody. At its heart lies a brief but affecting elegy. York Bowen is another composer overshadowed until recently by the likes of Vaughan Williams and Britten, but he was praised by Saint-Saens in 1903 as ‘the most remarkable of the young British composers’ and compared to Rachmaninov as both a pianist of formidable gifts and in his virtuosic writing for the instrument. Meanwhile, the sonata by Herbert Howells is a wartime work, unperformed at the time by its dedicatee, Leon Goossens, and only receiving its premiere in 1984. The most substantial work on the album, the sonata’s moods reflect their troubled times, not least in refuge from them.  Marika Lombardi formed her duo with the French pianist Natalie Dang in 2003.

The previous album was praised in online reviews for ‘the excellent playing of Gran Duo Italiano’ (Lynn Rene Bailey) and the sense, so characteristic of the composer, that ‘irony is always just around the corner when it comes to Milhaud, and the wink and sardonic smile is there along with whatever mock pomposity he comes up with’ (Dean Frey).  They are now joined by Pierluigi Bernard, first of all for the lively Suite from 1936 which Milhaud wrote for all three instruments: an unusual combination in itself, but then Milhaud’s facility allowed him to write for almost any imaginable ensemble, while always coming up withmusic that is grateful for the musicians, pleasant for the listeners and inimitably personal to himself. With the Danses de Jacaremirim Op.256 (1945) for violin and piano, Milhaud made playful reference to a small Brazilian alligator with big eyes and a long snout, reflecting his long-standing passion for the culture of that country. Its salon-like easy humour is shared by the Sonatina pastorale for solo violin and the Caprice for clarinet and piano. By contrast, the Élegie for viola and piano, also from 1945, more reflects the temper of its troubled times, whereas the Farandoleurs from the following year is a playful, heartfelt homage to the Renaissance-era Provencal dance form. Perhaps the best-known work on the album is the Scaramouche Suite which exists in several versions, and is here performed on clarinet and piano. The suite shares with the best of Milhaud a quality of rational distance from intense expression, a palpable sense of joy taken in making music, and an irrepressible sense of fun. If it’s hard to know what lies behind the masks, it’s impossible not to smile with the masks themselves.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=BRI95449,Classical,Germany,2017 Brilliant Classics,2017 Brilliant Classics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nevertheless, Mouquet’s own music does not deserve its present obscurity. Mostly composed in the first decade of the last century, these attractive works for flute and piano do not aspire to the Impressionism of Claude Debussy which was, by then, a decade old; nor yet do they so much as acknowledge the winds of change blowing from Vienna or New York.  La Flute de Pan is Mouquet’s best-known piece, taken up by the likes of Sir James Galway. Composed in 1904, it was also his first for this combination of flute and piano, cast in a mood of playful and bewitching lyricism as it dances from shady groves to mountain heights via epigrammatic quotations from Greek poetry at the head of each of its three movements. Classical themes and a mood of carefree gaiety are also shared by the contemporaneous Eglogue, Danse Grecque, Divertissement Grec and Berceuse. The five short pieces of 1925 move towards Debussyan Impressionism with yearning, chromatic tapestries of sound that still draw on ancient Greek modes for a harmonic foundation.

This organ reflects the rich tonal resources that would have been at the skilled fingertips of Scheidemann, Schildt, Weckmann and Strungk, who were active in the 17th century around the Hanseatic area on such organs as those at St Catherine’s and St James’s, Hamburg, the Marktkirche, Hannover, and Braunschweig’s St Martini church. Manuel Tomadin is joined in these Magnificat performances by award winning tenor and early music ensemble director Giuseppe Maletto.

Interspersed here with solo organ works are eight alternatim settings of the Magnificat, in which a choir intones a line of the hymn, followed by an instrumental fantasia based on the line of chant. Two organs are represented on the album, both of historical significance. The Magnificats, the Salve Regina, the Ricercate, and the Fughe sopra Girometta and Ut re mi fa sol la were recorded on the Antegnati organ (c. 1589) in Verona Cathedral; whereas the Canzoni are played on the organ at Trevi in Umbria, built in 1509 by Paolo Pietro da Montefalco. Despite subsequent alterations, the original nucleus of the pipes remains intact, such that when the instrument was restored during the 20th century the sound equipment was found to be pretty much as it was when it was first installed. Today it is recognized as one of the earliest organs in the world. This album is the latest in a series of successful partnerships on record between the organist and harpsichordist Federico del Sordo and the priest and conductor Alberto Turco. Together they have also recorded alternatim mass settings by Claudio Merulo (BC95145) and Giovanni Salvatore (BC95146). del Sordo has also accompanied the violinist Valerio Losito in Baroque sonata albums by Telemann (BC95131), Tessarini (BC94787) and Veracini (BC94822). The Merulo album was welcomed by MusicWeb International for its ‘stark beauty’ as ‘a fine experience… well worth exploring.’ There is much rewarding listening here for fovers of Renaissance and Baroque choral music as they explore another overlooked figure.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=BRI95512,Classical,Germany,2017 Brilliant Classics,2017 Brilliant Classics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, then, is a marvellous chance to catch up with the thoroughly entertaining work of a musician, Genoese born and bred. He was no organ specialist but a musician of diverse talents who composed for the stage, with at least three operas to his name, the concert-hall, including symphonic tone-poems and concert-overtures.  His extant output, however, centres on church music. L’organo moderno Op.106 is a collection of 24 versets for organ: brief pieces of hugely varied character, designed as inserts to cover or accompany variousstages of the Mass that would otherwise be silent. Gambini is an imaginative composer for the organ’s timbral possibilities: flutes, horns, bassoons, and Vox Humana stops are all given solo spots. These are then further exploited in the Concertone per molti stromenti, which features folk-like melodies.  In his own booklet introduction to Gambini, Marco Ruggeri explains that he has chosen to arrange some of the composer’s piano music for organ, such as excerpts from the Capricci caratteristici Op.55 and the Scintille elettriche Op.90, whose work-titles (chorale, toccata and so on) suggest a compatibility with the organ. Le Quattro Stagioni Op.128 was composed at a time when Vivaldi’s now ubiquitous cycle of concertos was completely unknown. Made up of four parts, one for each season, the work expresses the composer’s perceptions of nature (evoking birdsong, storms and ice), and of seasonal rituals, both sacred and secular (hunting in autumn, a prayer following a summer storm, winter dances). The organ music of lesser-known, 19th-century Italian composers has been explored by Marco Ruggeri on several Brilliant Classics albums. Here he plays on the instrument built by Ernesto Lingiardi in 1854 for the Church of St. Vittore, Calcio, in the Lombardian province of Bergamo.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=BRI95515,Classical,Germany,2017 Brilliant Classics,2017 Brilliant Classics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of the series is to further awareness and understanding of musical idioms that do not necessarily reflect traditional preconceptions of classical harmony. The selection by Cristiano Porqueddu was determined by a number of features: music without a strong sense of tonality; a wide range of timbre; and a polyphonic conception of the instrument.  Volume 2 begins with the second collection of 12 Easy Pieces for Guitar by the Polish composer, Alexandre Tansman – the first collection having been included within Volume 1. These delightful, elegant studies reveal meticulous construction and a certain constancy of form that speak for the composer’s inventive skill. Stephen Dodgson (1924-2013) wrote works for the guitar that attracted the attention of outstanding performers such as Julian Bream and John Williams: these Transitional Studies call for more advanced skill than the other works on the album.  Unlike the other works here, the limpid collection of Ten Progressive Studies by the Italian guitarist and composer Franco Cavallone (1957) does not aim at improving technique, but at helping the player master control of sound and colour. The Hungarian composer Ivan Patachich (1922-1993) wrote two collections of Gyermekdalok gitarra (Children’s Songs for Guitar) published in 1978, a series of fresh, original vignettes that belie the composer’s remarkable technical skill and elegance. The music of Manuel Ponce is better known than any of the previous composers: he wrote the Six Short Preludes for Juanita, the young daughter of the Mexican composer Carlos Chavez, shortly after she had begun to study the guitar. Nonetheless, in simplifying his idiom Ponce managed not to drain his music of its vivacity: the result is music that guitarists of all abilities will take pleasure from.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=BRI95557,Classical,Germany,2017 Brilliant Classics,2017 Brilliant Classics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He probably copied them out – or had them copied – for the purpose of playing them himself, but the manuscript now provides a significant record of pieces that would otherwise be lost, many of them by authors now unknown to us. Among the 69 pieces there are anonymously authored dances but also fantasias by Francesco da Milano and Lorenzino del Liuto, and intabulations of vocal works such as the famous Vestiva i colli and Susanne ung jour. Through the Raimondo Manuscript we may enter the rarified world of high-Renaissance culture as seen through the eyes and ears of a cultivated amateur.  The collection has received relatively little attention on record before now, making this new recording all the more valuable: probably the first album to be devoted to it. The booklet-note gives valuable context both to the history and performance practice, written by the artist on this recording, Domenico Cerasini.

The Dances of Marosszek are rooted in an earlier period: they conjure up an image of a Fairyland of the past."" So wrote Zoltan Kodaly in the preface to his through-composed rondo-collection of dances, but his point stands for the other works on this compilation. He was a pioneer in bringing genuinely native inflections and timbres to the context of art-music from Hungary.  Relating episodes from the life of a quintessentially Hungarian hero, Hary Janos now counts as the first national opera of note (even if surpassed internationally a few years later by Duke Bluebeard’s Castle), and its music travelled far more widely once Kodaly made this orchestral suite inimitably coloured by the twang of the cimbalom. The Psalmus Hungaricus, too, powerfully conjures a sense of national pride, and a nationalism unburdened by bombast, in its progress from the tenor soloist’s laments towards a conclusion filled with hope and conviction all the more resonant for its composition in the middle of the feverish 1920s. Classics Today noted of album 1 that ""There’s no question that Ádam Fischer and the Hungarian State Symphony Orchestra know how this music should go and characterize it well. Hary Janos, in particular, has a number of expressive personal touches in such sections as the Song and Intermezzo that bespeak a long and affectionate acquaintance."" Fanfare praised the ‘idiomatic authority’ of the Budapest Festival Orchestra’s playing on album 2, marshalled with ‘shrewd insight’ by Ivan Fischer: ‘colours, too - whether in the moments of dark introspection or in the more peaceful passages - have a rare glow.’",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=BRI95603,Classical,Germany,2017 Brilliant Classics,2017 Brilliant Classics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We find another prolific trumpet composer in the German baroque violinist Johann Melchior Molter, and fine concertos from Quantz, famed more for his flute music, and Johannes Matthias Sperger, a renowned player of and composer for the double bass. The music of Quantz’s teacher, Jan Dismas Zelenka, is enjoying a revival, as is that of Johann Friedrich Fasch, admired by both Bach and Telemann, who wrote an extraordinary concerto for three wind choirs with nine trumpets between them. Later in the 18th century, some composers stretched the limits of virtuosity in the natural trumpet, before the advent of valves around 1815. These include Georg Reutter II and the enigmatic Franz Querfurth, who both demanded sustained playing in the highest register. Tuscan composer Francesco Manfredini, like Querfurth, is known today for little else besides his trumpet concerto, while the majority of his works are now lost to history. Authors who wrote prominently for the trumpet in pieces other than concertos include Johann Schmelzer and Johann Joseph Fux, along with Fux’s student Frantisek Tuma, while Beethoven’s composition teacher Johann Georg Albrechtsberger wrote concertos for the jaw harp, whose harmonics are well suited to adaptation for the natural trumpet. Though somewhat overshadowed by their more illustrious family members, Michael Haydn and Leopold Mozart both wrote fine trumpet concertos, while two generations of Bibers, Carl Heinrich and his more prominent father Heinrich Ignaz Franz, composed sonatas and dances for multiple trumpets. Rounding out this set are outstanding modern additions to the trumpet repertoire, including trumpet concertos by the Armenian Alexander Arutiunian and French composer Andre Jolivet, as well as Shostakovich’s Piano Concerto No.1, which casts the solo trumpet in a prominent role",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=BRI95608,Classical,Germany,2017 Brilliant Classics,2017 Brilliant Classics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Debussy described the work as ‘Three symphonic sketches for orchestra’, thus avoiding the term ‘symphony,’ which would have imposed a specific musical structure, as well as the expression ‘symphonic poem,’ which would imply that the music was descriptive in nature. ‘Sketches’ was a wise choice, precisely because it neatly conveys that the music is meant to do no more than provide an impression. Whereas Debussy occupied himself spontaneously and intuitively with looking for new sounds, Ravel placed much more emphasis on the effect that the sounds could have in the context of a musical story.

The Six Suites for solo cello are nowadays performed on a wide range of instruments and Tilman Hoppstock has adapted the Suites Nos. 1, 2 and 5 for his instrument the guitar.

Baritone Daniel Ochoa, who is praised for his stage presence and expressiveness by audiences and critics alike, recently added many achievements to his portfolio. In 2015–2016 he had his role debuts as Giovanni and Marcello at the Vienna Volksoper, played the role of Dr. Falke (Die Fledermaus) in Tokyo’s Bunka Kaikan Theatre and gave several concerts in Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and Switzerland.

The violin part, in D major, therefore sounds as if it were written in E flat major, which is the key of the orchestral accompaniment. During the 19th century, the practice of tuning the instrument higher was abandoned. Bulgarian violinist Mario Hossen courageously tackles it, allowing us to hear, for the first time since Paganini’s time, these works as they were written.

2018,608917721423,EPRC0027,Johann Sebastian Bach,Johann Sebastian  Bach: Six Suites for Cello Solo,Pieter Wispelwey,2,CD,EPR,EPR-Classic,14.81,22.99,CN23,"Made at the age of 50, this is Pieter Wispelwey’s third recording of the Cello Suites by J.S. Bach, and in very many ways his most impressive. The big difference in this case is that the cello is equipped with gut strings and tuned to 392 Hz. This results in tuning roughly a half-tone lower than usual, and with lower tension in the strings this has a greater effect than you might imagine. The low tension strings makes the way the music ‘speaks’ very different, and this is articulated in peformances which have a strong narrative feel and less emphasis on the lyrical side of the music. Wispelwey extends shapes, plays with pauses and silence, and explores the resonance of the instrument to the full. So yes, even if you know and love one or more complete recording of J.S. Bach’s Suites for cello solo, then you owe it to yourself to acquire a copy of this release. If there was a recording which takes us behind the notes of these pieces and adds to our understanding of their qualities then this is the one. That these are deeply satisfying performances and a marvelous recording seems an almost incidental bonus.

Together with the booklet essay-writer, Jeanne Roudet, Torbianelli has considered afresh the music written by Frederic Chopin in the last fifteen years of the Polish composer’s life. To follow on from his collection, Torbianelli has recorded at Fondation Royaumont in France – playing on an 1842 Ignace Pleyel grand piano – Chopin’s A flat Polonaise-Fantaisie, Op 61, the B minor Sonata Op. 58 and a selection of Mazurkas and Nocturnes for this new Schola Cantorum Basiliensis release presented by Glossa. With this programme Edoardo Torbianelli is situating the compositional approach more directly within Chopin’s Polish heritage; though he later went into exile the composer was present in Warsaw until just before the November Uprising in 1830. Unlike Berlioz and Liszt, it is argued, Chopin eschewed literature as direct inspiration and – again unlike Liszt – the Polish composer’s piano music shares similarities in technique and performative style with the bel canto school of singing, the descendant of the art of eighteenth-century castrati and perpetuated in the 1800s by Italian singers as heard by Chopin himself in Paris. The resulting “vocality” of Chopin’s piano music finds echo in Edoardo Torbianelli’s interpretations for a recording which can be considered both for its fresh approach but also as a masterly reflection of the composer’s genius.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=GCD922517,Classical,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Neapolitan school – which owed so much in its formation to Francesco Provenzale – flourished in the hands of Francesco Mancini, Nicola Porpora, Nicola Fiorenza, Giovanni Battista Pergolesi and Alessandro Scarlatti, all represented with concertos on this new Glossa recording. The four major conservatories in the city created an astonishingly productive and innovative environment for musicians – students and their teachers alike. The composers here all studied or worked in the conservatories or at the Cappella Real. The Neapolitan concerto had its own structure at this time, which was quite different to that found in the Venice of Vivaldi, and there was a constant competitive spirit for soloists to demonstrate their virtuosity. As they showed with their earlier Glossa recording of Il Spiritillo Brando, the members of La Ritirata are more than a match for their Neapolitan predecessors in both stylishness and technique. The soloists gathered by Josetxu Obregón represent some of the leading musical lights in Spain today: violinist Hiro Kurosaki (in a Fiorenza concerto), recorder-player Tamar Lalo (Scarlatti and Mancini), harpsichordists Ignacio Prego and Daniel Oyarzabal (Pergolesi) and not least, Obregón himself who is the cello soloist in works by Fiorenza and Porpora.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=GCD923106,Classical,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A sequence of madrigals – in the broadest sense of the definition of the form – is spearheaded by a dramatic interpretation of the Combattimento di Tancredi e Clorinda (with Luca Dordolo as Testo). Francesca Lombardi Mazzulli – who also appeared on Glossa’s recent Alcina of Francesca Caccini and Silla of Handel – takes centre stage for an impassioned rendition of the Lamento della ninfa, an ostinato- driven work nicely counterbalanced on this recording by a bonus track of Giovanni Felice Sances’ mesmerizing Usurpator tiranno. Two of the other pieces chosen to represent the Baroque musical “shock of the new” for this recording prepared by the Monteverdi specialist Marco Mencoboni are Ed e pur dunque vero (from the Scherzi musicali) and the Lettera amorosa (Settimo libro dei madrigali).In his booklet essay for this new manifestation of Glossa’s abiding passion for the Seicento, Pierre Élie Mamou offers an absorbing analysis of Monteverdi’s adoption of the stile moderno, especially in terms of how it clashed with the ideals of Giovanni Maria Artusi and how it was expressed so potently in the Combattimento.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=GCD923512,Classical,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rather than simplification, a new recording of selections from his expressive output from Bjorn Schmelzer and Graindelavoix, entitled Portrait of the artits as a starved dog, is more likely to yield illumination and fascination. That is Schmelzer’s way. As with many Graindelavoix recordings on Glossa, the accompanying artwork in the CD booklet forms an integral part of the convincing performance (as does Schmelzer’s essay). Here, the imagery includes images by Albrecht Durer and Hans Mielich, statues of Melpomene and Medusa, sculptures by Michelangelo, even a sardonyx cameo cup. A portrait of De Rore shows the inner likeness of the composer as being possessed of a manic madness or “furor divinus” and having the guise of an emaciated dog. De Rore was born in Ronse – not that far from Schmelzer’s Antwerp – and, as well as probably being under the protection of Margaret of Parma, he travelled through Europe in the first half of the sixteenth century, notably to Ferrara. Regarded as a pivotal figure in the evolution of the madrigal, De Rore’s style developed significantly across his career and Graindelavoix’s programme gravitates from some of his settings of stanze from Ariosto’s epic poem Orlando furioso through to some of his later, much more radical madrigals.

The development of listener’s taste is a mysterious process, however, and while the music of Lutyens, Searle, and their generation is now rarely performed, that of Finzi and Howells has persisted in the repertory of orchestras, chamber musicians, singers, and, especially choirs.

Paul Ben-Haim was an eminent German-born Israeli composer and teacher, leader of the Eastern Mediterranean school, synthesized Eastern and Western approaches to music in compositions of exceptionally fine craftsmanship. He was the leader of a group of Palestinian musicians, many of them European emigres, who developed a fusion of Eastern and Western musical traditions. Isolated during World War II, this group, many of whom had been thoroughly trained in European conservatories and academies of music, studied the music of the Middle East and came to incorporate its melodic and rhythmic character into the forms of Western music. After the Nazi reign and his return to Dresden, Samuel Dresden emerged as the country’s leading twentieth-century composer of oratorios and festive choral music. Finally, Berthold Goldschmidt was a rising superstar in Germany, his move to England certainly ensured his survival and opened up many opportunities. However, he toiled as a composer, mostly in obscurity, for decades after his emigration.

The pianist’s sparse, light notes, whose touch remains luminous, slowly reveal an introspective world that is peopled by his two sparring partners. First, Nicolas Kummert whose contained sax-playing vibrates in tune with soundscapes from Saturn haunted by Scandinavian mist. Then Thibault Dille, whose lyrical accordion creates waves of melody lines while lavishing warm and decisive rainbow colors over the beautiful miniatures. On “Release” and “Dreamcatcher,” singer Emily Allison vocalizes and adds airy worlds that open the music onto a disturbing dream-like world of light and shade.

After a journey of initiation in Central Africa with the Aka Pygmies, Fabrizio Cassol, Michel Hatzigeorgiou and Stephane Galland embarked on a wide-ranging musical exploration that was then totally innovative, notably in its rhythmic aspects. Very soon their music continued to grow through contact with a succession of eminent musicians from all over the world. The first big impact came from India; two albums were recorded there and the encounter with the great Carnatic percussionist U. K. Sivaraman (southern Indian music) left a lasting mark on the group. Then it was back to Africa and a meeting with the master of the Senegalese sabar Doudou N’Diaye Rose that created new musical ‘constellations’. And these were only the first of many. For example, there was the collaboration with a Big Band of DJs, with musicians from the Balkans, or the incursion of the sonatas of Domenico Scarlatti into a jazz quartet...

After their initiatory journey with the Aka Pygmies in 1992, an unappeased desire has always nourished the research of the three accomplices: the wish to share the knowledge, experience and secrets of other musicians from all backgrounds. Today, the necessity of the original trio is again expressed in ‘NOW’ with the exceptional playing quality that has been acquired and refined over the course of numerous concerts. For although Aka Moon was undeniably born with a unique sound, the group has always made it evolve, absorbing, in particular, rhythms from the Orient, Africa or India. The staunch friendship that binds these three musicians lets an artistic urgency resonate, borne by the joy of improvisation, lightness of interpretation as well as great depth of expression. NOW confirms this cohesion thanks to an ongoing counterpoint in which three mysteriously complementary worlds intertwine, revealing their own originalities and styles.

This truly titanic struggle is the basis of this recording, with works that lead up to the first pieces to be composed for valve horn.

He begins with three movements from Petrushka for solo piano, drawn directly from the ballet by the composer ten years after the completion of the orchestral score. Stravinsky’s goal (together with the jazz-like Piano-Rag-Music) was to encourage pianist Arthur Rubinstein to play his music. His intention was to make the arrangement not only technically challenging but also musically satisfying. Such are its demands however, that even the composer himself only played it once, confessing that he lacked the technique. This set also includes Stravinsky’s early, charmingly delicate F-sharp minor Sonata which he completed in 1904 but it was only published in 1973.

When composing, he mainly drew inspiration from traditional music. He kept returning to the texts from Frantisek Susil’s collection of Moravian folk songs, a copy of which he always kept with him during his travels. In addition to their rhythmicity and modality, he was fascinated by the archetypal themes they treated, their grace and conciseness, as well as the directness, devoid of “metaphysics and pathos”, and, above all, the subject of love in a variety of forms – happy and ill-fated, unrequited, betrayed… The present recording features the complete choral works Martinu intended (according to a number of sources) for chamber formations. Even though created over a great time span, between 1934 and 1959 (the composer only completed the Madrigals shortly before his death), all the pieces attest to the genius and sensitivity with which Martinu was able to handle the folk texts and furnish them with a new musical form – simple, spirited and majestic alike.

The cycle of six sonatas for two oboes, bassoon and continuo serves to prove that his assertion is far from being mere hyperbole, that it is a justified opinion worthy of being giving serious thought. Although for many years Zelenka performed all the duties of Kapellmeister and court composer of the Dresden Hofkapelle, he did not gain the appraisal he deserved. Zelenka’s sonatas are among his “free” works, which he wrote urged by innermost needs, above and beyond his official commitments. The pieces reach the very limits of musical possibilities – both as regards placing high technical requirements on the performers and the compositional methods and means of expression applied, including the striking architecture of the cycle as a whole. The result is magnificent and fascinating indeed; owing to its complexity and timelessness, the sonatas may perhaps only be compared with J. S. Bach’s six cello suites.

His generous output of music – ripe for rediscovery – includes seven symphonies, fifteen violin sonatas among much other chamber music, songs, and choral and piano pieces. His expansive E flat Piano Trio of 1905 sits firmly in the Viennese Romantic tradition downstream from Schubert and Brahms, with one lovely tune following another, whereas the Three Songs, written only four years later, look forward to the lyrical intensity of Korngold. Violinist Laura Roelofs is currently Assistant Concertmaster of the Michigan Opera Theatre Orchestra and director of the string performance area at Wayne State University in Detroit. Stefan Koch is a frequent performer with the Kalamazoo Symphony, West Michigan Symphony, Toledo Symphony, and Grand Rapids Symphony Orchestras.

Wagner has a natural and imaginative approach to music and his instrument. His talent for composition and interpretation make his musical visions so convincing and original that they justly give rise to great hopes for the future.” Pavel Gililov Alexander Maria Wagner‘s interpretation of the most popular piano drama of the Romantic era, Tchaikovsky‘s Piano Concerto in B-flat minor, that he deliberately chose to place next to his Second Symphony, as an especially stark contrast, gives one a feeling for his natural talent as a pianist and the facility with which he commands his instrument (or it him). This symphonic antithesis, interrupted in the first movement by the sensitive language of Johanna Kapelari‘s short, moving poem, that is as sweetly disturbing for the listener‘s soul as Tchaikovsky‘s music, also has the effect that we are completely overwhelmed by Wagner‘s nuclear sound world — together with the great RTV Symphony Orchestra Moscow and the outstanding conductor Alexei Kornienko. Such music, which unfolds so philosophically even in the tiniest abrupt modulations of its compositional architecture, has not yet been heard or at least not with such a yearning character.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=TXA17096,Classical,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Harpsichordist Fernando de Luca performs Handel’s complete preludes and toccatas from the Bergamo Manuscript in their world premiere recording. Fernando De Luca was born in Rome in 1961. He started to compose in the baroque idiom at 9 or before. At 14, he joined the Conservatory of Rome “Santa Cecilia” to study Organ and Piano, although his true passion was the Harpsichord. Among the many musical experiences De Luca had during his early activity in Roman musical life, one of the most important was his apprenticeship with Mons. Domenico Bartolucci who was Maestro di Cappella (Kapell Meister / Chapel’s Master) for the Cappella Sistina in the Vatican. Here Fernando approached the study of Sacred Music, counterpoint and learnt the art of improvisation and composition. He graduated in 1987 (Piano, with V. De Vita) and 1992 (Harpsichord, with P. Bernardi) and in the same years, was a prizewinner in the AMR (Associazione Musicale Romana) and a harpsichord contest at “G.Rossini” Conservatory in Pesaro. Currently Fernando lives in Venice, where in addition to composing, he is a member of the Period Instruments Orchestra “Accademia Barocca di Santa Cecilia” (directed by Paolo Pollastri), where he is the basso continuo player.

These works reflect the gentle character of the composer's style, steeped through nearly thirty years of singing in English Cathedrals. It is a happy coincidence that Exeter Cathedral is where Michael Walsh first sang in a Cathedral setting: in 1968, the choir of Allhallows school sang the D minor setting by Walmisley and Batten’s O sing joyfully there and he was hooked. After studying at Trinity College of Music in London, Michael settled in Chichester and was a member of the Cathedral Choir under John Birch and Alan Thurlow from 1972-1990. He sang for a further ten years in Portsmouth Cathedral Choir.
