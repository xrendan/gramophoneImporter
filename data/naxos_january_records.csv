Usually, the titles of compositions give us insight into how their creators were inspired by literature, landscapes or works of art. But mere titles do not exhaust the phenomenon of crossing borders the least. Many artists have multiple talents. Franz Liszt not only composed, but was also an outstanding piano virtuoso. Robert Schumann had to give up his promising piano career. Both possessed literary talent. On this new release, Alexander Gadjiev performs works by Liszt and Schumann that were inspired by literature. Tutored by his father, a well-known Russian teacher, Alexander Gadjiev played a solo concerto for the first time with orchestra at the age of nine and held his first solo recital aged ten. He is currently studying with Pavel Gililov at Mozarteum Salzburg and participating in prestigious masterclasses such as the “Eppan Piano Academy” and “Verbier Piano Academy,” both limited to a very small number of selected pianists from around the world.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=ACO13117,Classical,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The connection between these composers is not even too far-fetched, since the eleven year-old Franz Liszt studied in Vienna with Beethoven’s student Carl Czerny. Not only did Franz Liszt later champion the prevalence of the works of Ludwig van Beethoven, he also supported the construction of the Beethoven monument in Bonn.

I have been fascinated by the Danube for as long as I can remember. This mysterious river joins people from Central and Eastern Europe, carrying their stories, their songs, their dances, their joys and sorrows. The music of the people living on the banks of the Danube is spellbinding in its capacity for expression. I feel very lucky to have grown up in an area where this music is still very much alive and an essential component of people’s lives. For years I was able to immerse myself in this enchanting musical universe and Following the river is the resulting unity between my classical training and my childhood interactions with folk musicians.

""Much as I admire many of my pianist colleagues performing this music on their instruments, there can be no question that the ‘virginals’ heard on this recording do more justice to the composer’s intentions and make it easier to render his musical language well. In the pre-Restoration England, the word virginal did not apply to a specific type of instrument, but to all the keyboard instruments in general. As today’s harpsichord making is a far cry from the best instruments built in the old days, I am happy that I had the opportunity to use a particularly admirable 16th century pair of “newe longe virginalles made harpe fasshion of cipres with a caese of wallnuttre” – exactly like the one so described in an ‘Inventory of the Guarderobes, etc.’ of King Henry VIII, 1547."" - Aapo Hakkinen",https://youtu.be/6yI2cdo6MFU,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=ABCD%20405,Classical,,Austria,2017 Alba Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The new decacorde model can be heard in three of the pieces. Jukka Tiensuu wrote Kymmari especially for it, and the same to some extent applies to Pekka Jalkanen’s Nocturne for Insomnia and The Bog Gypsies. The four lowest strings have no frets in this ten-stringed guitar. I developed the instrument in partnership with guitar maker Kauko Liikanen in 2015. In the earlier model I play for the other pieces (also built by Kauko Liikanen, in 2001), there are frets under all the strings. The absence of frets affords both the player and the composer some interesting potential.

At the same time, the ""Great Terror"" under Stalin reached its gruesome peak. Prokofiev, who settled permanently in Moscow in 1936, knew which country he had entered. The first position amongst Soviet composers seemed to have been vacated when Shostakovich had become a non-person following the Pravda article Muddle instead of Music. Prokofiev indicated his cooperation: he was determined to become a Soviet composer. In the Cantata for the 20th Anniversary of the October Revolution he played out his genuine enthusiasm for mass scorings, combining colossal symphonic forces with a double choir, a brass band, an accordion ensemble and a gigantic percussion section. The cantata oscillates between revolutionary vehemence and lyrical melodies, between Russian folklore and riotous military tumult. An exceptional historical document of the highest compositional level - released in the year of the 100th anniversary of the October Revolution. Kirill Karabits, Music Director of the Deutsches Nationaltheater and Staatskapelle Weimar, realises this monumental work with the Staatskapelle Weimar, the Ernst Senff Chor Berlin and members of the Erfurt Air Force Band.

There are several reasons for this, and they go back a long way. In ensembles, the viola, as the middle part, usually played a subordinate role. In court and municipal orchestras, the posts of violists were generally poorly filled in terms of both quality and of quantity. The first author to highlight the viola’s pivotal role in harmony and voice-leading was Johann Mattheson, who pointed out in 1713 that everything would sound dissonant without the viola.The fact that solo viola parts were generally entrusted to skillful violinists eventually led to the emergence of works written specifically for viola. With this recording exclusively featuring world premieres (with the exception of Flackton) of original compositions for viola, we are thus able to provide a multi-faceted glimpse of late 18th-century repertoire for viola and keyboard- works that are mostly forgotten today.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=AVI%208553312,Classical,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

That performance earned a Critic’s Choice in American Record Guide and an ‘Empfehlung’ on German website Klassik-Heute.de, and throughout the series Neschling and his team have received high praise for incisive interpretations and luxurious playing.  The present release brings together three of Respighi’s more popular works, besides the perennial Roman trilogy. Scored for small orchestra, his Botticellian Triptych has all the freshness of the famous paintings of the Renaissance master: Spring, Adoration of the Magi and Birth of Venus. Subtitled ‘poemetto lirico’ Il tramonto was originally composed for voice and string quartet, but is often performed with a larger complement of strings, as here. Soprano Anna Caterina Antonacci breathes impassioned life into Shelley’s Romantic poem The Sunset  in which love is brutally cut short by death. The disc closes with the four Church Windows, three of which originated as piano preludes based on Gregorian themes. In 1925 Respighi composed a fourth companion piece, and recast the set as a suite for orchestra.

To begin with, we do not know how many he actually composed, as some have been lost while others have been wrongly attributed to him. Although several of the motets were written for funerals, it is also uncertain if they were actually performed during church services: as a genre, the motet was established as early as the 13th century and by Bach's time it was considered to be old-fashioned and backward-looking. Even so, the motets are the only vocal works by Bach that have an unbroken performance tradition until the present time, which may serve as testimony to the powerful response that they induce in listeners and performers alike. They were originally believed to have been composed for choir a cappella, but it is now thought that Bach himself may have performed them either a cappella or with instruments doubling the vocal parts and with basso continuo. For this recording, Grete Pedersen has opted for variety, performing four of the works with the support of the instrumentalists of Ensemble Allegria, and the remaining three with organ continuo.

Complete cycles of the symphonies of Schumann and Schubert have appeared alongside individual discs with music by Dvorak, Bruckner and Tchaikovsky, as well as a recording of Johannes Brahms’s First Symphony, released in 2012. The disc was named Recommendation of the Month in the German magazine Fono Forum, while the reviewer in International Record Review described it as ‘an account to make one hope a complete traversal is in the offing’. Five years later that hope is nearing fulfilment, as the team’s recording of Symphony No. 2 is released. Composed during the summer of 1877, which Brahms spent at the idyllic Worthersee, it is one of his sunniest works, often compared to Beethoven’s Pastoral symphony. It’s followed by the Haydn Variations, in which Brahms was able to combine one of his favourite musical forms – that of theme and variations – with his deep admiration for Joseph Haydn. (Fortunately, the discovery that the theme in question, known as the ‘St Antoni Chorale’, wasn’t by Haydn after all was made long after Brahms’s death.)  The programme continues with other favourites in Brahms’s production, including his greatest commercial success in the form of three of the hugely popular set of Hungarian Dances for piano, here in orchestrations by Thomas Dausgaard.

With the fourth instalment, published in 1783, he went further still as he increased the number of pieces to seven and added ‘free fantasias’ to the sonatas and rondos. Continuing his survey of Bach’s keyboard music – and the Kenner und Liebhaber series – Miklos Spanyi performs the collection on a tangent piano, an early form of the piano with strings that are struck by small wooden slips (‘tangents’). The basic sound of the instrument is reminiscent of the harpsichord, but this can be modified in a number of ways through the use of various devices. Spanyi rounds off the programme with two further works, of which the Sonata in F major, Wq 65/19 may be the very last keyboard composition that Bach completed during his lifetime.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=BIS-2254,Classical,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite the proximity in time and tonality, there are clear differences between the two works: the quintet tends more towards a concertante dialogue between the piano and string quartet while the quartet favours equality between the four parts – even if the cello has something of a leading role among the strings. Some ten years later, the young Johannes Brahms was entrusted with the task of making a piano four-hands arrangement of the quartet, and it is quite possible that this contact with Schumann’s chamber music for piano and strings opened his eyes to the potential of the genre. In any case, with its almost inexhaustible motivic abundance and captivating energy Brahms’s Piano Quintet in F minor, Op.34, is one of the most often performed works for these forces. Completed in 1864 it had actually started off as a string quintet which Brahms first reworked as a sonata for two pianos before arriving at the final scoring.

Composed between 1873 (Tchaikovsky) and 1893 (Dvorak), the three quartets gathered on this disc form a catalogue of unforgettable tunes and of emotions ranging from nostalgia to the most infectious joy. Each of the three composers wrote more than one quartet – Dvorak’s list of works includes as many 14! – but the ones recorded here are by far their best-loved. A contributing fact is surely that they all three include slow movements that tug at every listener’s heartstrings. Especially Tchaikovsky’s Andante cantabile and Borodin’s Notturno have become favourites in their own right, and exist in arrangements for every possible combination of instruments. But there is more to these works than the slow movements: throughout each quartet there is a wealth of melodic invention, rhythmic vitality and lyric fleetness which the Escher’s know how to exploit to the full.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=BIS-2280,Classical,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

From the 1970s, state restrictions on religion were gradually relaxed and this was reflected in the arts and especially in music. Schnittke’s adoption of Christianity was triggered by the death of his mother in 1972, and culminated in his later conversion to Catholicism. Part was from a nominally Lutheran background in Estonia, but embraced the Orthodox faith in the 1970s, following intensive study of liturgical music. Both composers began to incorporate religious themes into their work, moving away from the modernist abstraction that had characterized their early careers.  Schnittke’s large-scale Psalms of Repentance were composed in 1988 for the celebrations for the millennium of Christianity in Russia. The texts come from an anonymous collection of poems for Lent, written in the 16th century, and in his settings Schnittke engages with the traditions of chant-based Orthodox liturgical music. The Estonian Philharmonic Chamber Choir and Kaspars Putnins have chosen to combine Schnittke’s Psalms with two shorter works by Arvo Part, whose music they are well-known exponents of.

In the case of Geschwinde, ihr wirbelnden Winde, BWV 201, however, it may well be that Bach composed it for his own sake: the message conveyed in the work can be interpreted as a defence of Bach’s own artistry and musical attitudes against the trend of the time towards easier fare. Subtitling the cantata ‘dramma per musica’, Bach sets an episode from Greek mythology in which Phoebus (Apollo) and Pan enter into a musical contest. Phoebus, the god of the arts, presents a beautifully balanced and technically accomplished aria, while Pan sings a rustic dance tune. The judges offer Phoebus the prize, but the verdict isn’t unanimous – King Midas prefers Pan’s catchy ditty, for which Phoebus punishes him by giving him donkey ears. On this amply-filled disc Bach’s praise of high art is followed by another tribute, now to Augustus III, Elector of Saxony and King of Poland. It is likely that Augustus never knew that the same music had been used 10 years earlier to congratulate a Leipzig academic on his promotion: Auf, schmetternde Tone… BWV 207a is based almost entirely on Vereinigte Zwietracht der wechselnden Saiten, BWV 207.

Both sets differ from the ‘normal’ configuration in that they allow a double bass to take part, albeit in different ways. Rossini, who composed his sonatas at the age of 12, left out the viola and gave the double bass a more or less conventional bass role – albeit with occasional virtuosic outbursts. The sonatas were first published in an arrangement for traditional string quartet and are often heard performed by string orchestras. In Vienna, where he was active as a composer and music publisher, Hoffmeister chose a different solution than Rossini and gave his double bass player a leading role in the ensemble, letting it replace the first violin. It was no coincidence that this happened in Vienna – considering the amount of solo works for the double bass composed there, the standard of playing must have been exceptional. On the present recording, it is the Dutch player Niek de Groot who takes up Hoffmeister’s challenge in the company of a Finnish trio consisting of Minna Pensola, Antti Tikkanen and Tuomas Lehto.

He had taught himself to play the cello to a reasonable standard (also the violin and viola) and while, as he freely admitted, not a natural virtuoso, he had a feeling for the instrument which is obvious in his writing. This is Vardai’s third album for Brilliant Classics, following the Solo Suites of Bach (BC95392) and a recording of the original version of Tchaikovsky’s Rococo Variations that won a glowing recommendation from Gramophone: ‘excitingly assured and agreeably spontaneous music-making… a superb performance triumphantly vindicates Tchaikovsky’s first thoughts… Vardai’s outstandingly fine contribution marries a gratifyingly sumptuous and varied tonal palette to a flawless technical address – that we shall be hearing a lot more from him I have not the slightest doubt.’",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=BRI95574,Classical,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The musician is the first in the world to do this, which is why he can be called the first dancehall organ guitarist. It is a crazy and adventurous project. The history of dancehall organs goes back to 1850, when the first dance organs were made. In Belgium and the south of Holland especially, the organ became immensely popular as a precursor of the jukebox. In cafes, fairs and dancehalls, the organs were playing the latest hits. Besides the many organ pipes, dance organs are often equipped with extra instruments such as accordions, percussion and saxophones. Stadhouders writes: “When composing contemporary music for these organs, you hear totally unique sounds, a mix between electronic and acoustic sounds. The dance-organ is really the first synthesizer.

It featured imaginary topographical scenes in which various elemnts, largely architectural, were brought together as never possible in real life. They offered dazzling views and set the imagination in a spin. Hugo von Hofmannsthal and Richard Strauss’s Der Rosenkavalier is the operatic equivalent, for in its recreation of ‘the old Vienna under the Empress Maria Theresia- the very period in which the genre of the capriccio flourished- it juxtaposes seemingly distinct elements, such as 18th-century social conventions, 19th century waltzes and 20th century thinking. Following Hofmannsthal’s lead, Strauss constantly switches between the lyrically symphonic and the downright bawdy in the opera. “Marc Albrecht, once again presented his platinum Strauss credentials… The Netherlands Philharmonic, playing with dreamline ease, tugged at the heart with airborne woodwinds and shapely violin lines, stopping a hair’s breadth away from full extravagance.

When Franz Schubert composed Auf dem Strom (“On the river”) in 1828, he had created a masterpiece in the genre of the so-called concert song. Schubert’s circle of friends in Vienna comprised many young composers, including Franz Lachner. “Die Seejungfern” (“The mermaids”) was written on January 1 1833 in Vienna. “Herbst” (“Autumn”), was written earlier. Another composer who live din Vienna at the same time as Franz Schubert was Conradin Kreutzer. His two songs with horn accompaniment, of which “Das Muhlrad” (“The Mill Wheel”) became very famous, whilst the later “Standchen” (“Serenade”) is hardly performed, both pay homage to the fashion of the time, but also reveal a well-versed composer at every turn.

The works formed part of an enormous music collection which belonged to Sara Levy, the great-aunt of Felix Mendelssohn. She was a distinguished harpsichordist, collector, and influential figure in the musical life of late-eighteenth- and early-nineteenth-century Berlin. Removed from the Berlin Sing-Akademie towards the end of World War II, her musical library was for many decades considered lost or destroyed. It was unearthed in Kiev only in 1999 and returned to Germany in 2001, where it is now again accessible to the public. While there can be no doubt that the instrumental oeuvre of Janitsch matched the diversity of that of some of his more prominent Berlin colleagues, the emphasis of his compositional output lay on chamber music, especially Quadros, four of which are featured here. The typical, prevailing dialogic structure of the Ouverture grosso highlights the influence which thematic play had on the rest of his work.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=CHAN%200820,Classical,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I have always wanted to reinterpret this music through my own experience. Using the instrumentalists in my band Sound Liberation I composed a brand new compositions heavily inspired by the original.

This comment by the Hungarian composer Sandor Veress, referring to his very free approach to twelve-tone techniques in his music, is cited by his son Claudio of the present edition. However, one could just as easily ascribe it to the political and personal circumstances with which Sandor Veress was confronted along his life’s adventurous path, which compelled him to a life in exile in the end: He grew up and was educated in Budapest; as a young man, he went to Berlin, London and Rome before becoming a political emigre at the end of the 1940s and finding, through several strokes of luck, a new home in Bern. The theme of being rooted, of origins and originality, also musically, preoccupied him throughout his life, as was particularly evident in his field research in Moldavian villages, on which he worked intensively even as a 23-year-old. With meticulousness and passion he documented the wealth of Hungarian song, both on paper and with the Edison phonograph, and this research infused his compositions, unmistakably perched on the threshold between folksong, the contrapuntal tradition up to the point of modernism and, from 1950, the twelve-tone method.

His statement is not a direct reference to Johann Sebastian Bach (1685–1750), though of course he places Bach in the highest echelon. Bach’s music is indisputably “great“, and he himself always confirmed that he composed in order to praise God. In the process he wrote a number of works that rise so far above the repertoire and formal canon of their time that they are rightly regarded as “timeless“ – “timeless“ not in terms of formal and technical details, but rather in their overall appearance. Examples include the Goldberg Variations (BWV 988), the Art of Fugue (BWV 1080) and the Six Suites for Violoncello Solo (BWV 1007–1012). Michael Denhoff: When I heard the final recording of the Goldberg Variations by Glenn Gould, a wish grew inside me to create something comparably amazing and comprehensive ... someday ... but at the time, in 1981, I was 26 and not yet mature enough for such an ambitious undertaking. Only now, and quite hesitantly – and wracked with self-doubt – have I felt qualified for the task, but with 28 variations I intended to remain “modest“ behind Bach. Even so, it grew to contain 30 variations, since the theme adds a bass line and thus itself becomes a variation; the concluding repeat of the Sarabande, similar to Bach’s Aria in the Goldberg Variations, is a further variation; indeed, Bach’s exact sequence of notes appears, but here with octave leaps.",https://www.cybele.de/michael-denhoff-bach-variationen-op-114-fuer-klavier,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=Cybele%20SACD%20161702,Classical,,Germany,2017,2017,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Not only does pianist Tom Beghin perform Beethoven’s trilogy of pianistic masterpieces on a magnificent new replica of Beethoven’s Broadwood piano, he uses a reconstruction of the Gehormaschine that was mounted on the composer’s piano so he could continue to create music as his hearing declined. “You do hear better when you bring your head under this machine, don’t you?” Andre Stein asked Beethoven. Two centuries later, we too can bring our heads under the machine and wonder: Do we hear Beethoven differently? Beghin draws us inside the hearing machine, where we feel as well as hear the essence of Beethoven’s rambunctious and irresistibly poetic musical vibrations. Inside the Hearing Machine invites us into the multisensory playground of a deaf composer for whom the machine was more than a hearing aid and who interacted with his instrument through much more than sound.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVqVs_eAN5k,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=EPRC0025,Classical,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

What is less well known is that the Gothenburg Symphony Orchestra can also lay claim to an impressive Strauss tradition. As early as its very first concert season in 1905/06, the orchestra performed Don Juan. Death and Transfiguration, conducted by Wilhelm Stenhammar, was added to the repertoire in 1912, and Ein Heldenleben formed part of the orchestra’s programs in the 1970s. In this new production of one of the most often-recorded orchestral works, Kent Nagano has chosen what is for him a characteristic approach: The life path of the hero Richard Strauss is not presented in a superficial and obvious way, reduced to purely illustrative program music that owes its effects to the overwhelming power of an enormous orchestral apparatus. Instead, Nagano and the Gothenburg Symphony Orchestra seek out the nuances, the compositional and tonal details – and reveal the brokenness experienced by the hero, the inner emotions, perceptions, and self-doubt found beneath the surface of the score, which often tends to be interpreted one-dimensionally.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=B108092,Classical,,Germany,2017 FARAO classics,2017 FARAO classics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its turbulence, languor, volatility, and repetitive ruthlessness are just some of the qualities that make it dangerously irresistible. The tender Aria movement is an echo (almost bar-by-bar) of the opening track An Anna II- itself an enigma, and why Adam begins the album with this beautiful song. The Finale is a mysterious labyrinth of extreme emotions. Its emotional narrative undoubtedly takes place in the shadows of night. Des Abends (Upon Evening) is great compliment to Der Schwere Abend (The Heavy Evening) as a dramatic contrast to the other two evening pieces, since the brooding nature of this song creates an interesting triptych when placed between the serenity of the two piano pieces.

Its basic idea is the experience of man and his life-giving optimism…” The work premiered in November 1937. The original idea for Symphony No. 6 was to create a monumental work for soloists, choir and orchestra on the lyrics of “Vladimir Ilyich Lenin” by Vladimir Mayakovski. But the poetic character of the poem makes the task difficult for Shostakovich, and he tries to include other works about Lenin. The concept failed. However, the result was a contemplative and lyrical composition with a structure not typical for a symphony- there were three movements instead of four and the sonata allegro was missing.

If one narrows down the dubious concept of fairness to appreciation, to classification as part of one of the great currents of development, one may venture a little further before realizing that fairness is not timeless, but subject to trends and conventions. CPE Bach remains subject to this fluctuation. When he was born, his more famous father JS Bach was shortly to be appointed director of music at the court of the Dukes of Saxe-Weimar, whom he had previously served as court organist. By the time the younger Bach was an adult, he had come to be seen as “the” Bach of his generation. However, in the wake of his death, his star had become increasingly eclipsed by his father.

Initially, while learning with my teacher, I could not understand that because I was playing all the pieces for the first time. But later, having frequently played many pieces, I saw the truth behind this idea. Unlike other forms of art, such as painting and literature, music itself cannot be enjoyed as an object, as books and paintings can. A piece of music exists only when it is being played and can be heard. You must be able to play the piece as if you have only just discovered it. It will then sound particularly convincing…Whenever a listener sits before me, it is important to intrigue him so that he gets the most out of my performance to him.

With its provocative, completely paradoxical tempo specifications and its enormous technical demands, this sonata has driven generations of pianists into the cloister: how on earth is this supposedly such a complex but at the same time emotionally charged work? Florian Uhlig shows how it works. Everything sounds very natural, fluid. Technical issues seem to play a very minor role. Instead, Uhlig prefers to take care of the work context. The recording is particularly interesting due to the inclusion of Schumann's rejected original finale and an Allegro (Op.8), which is closely related to Schumann's first Sonata Op. 11, which can also be admired on this album. And this again shows Uhlig's claim to present the most complete recording of the Schumann piano oeuvre so far, but fortunately not the most complex one.

Reference was made to the “lost classics of the twentieth century.” The twentieth century brought forth many examples of the suppression of works by certain composers and even of whole categories of music. The numerous composers labeled as “degenerate” in Nazi Germany are fine examples. Since the late 1980s there has been a revival of works by Jewish composers murdered in the Holocaust; such composers include Viktor Ullmann, Pavel Haas, Erwin Schulhoff, Jozef Koffler and Gideon Klein. Only after the breakup of the Soviet Union were Russian avant-garde works of the 1910s and 1920s by Arthur Lourie, Alexander Mosolov, Sergei Protopopov, Nikolai Roslavets, Leonid Polovinkin and Gavriil Popov rediscovered.

The little crown of pink wooden beads has been introduced in the West at the Age of Crusades, and since then it has become a symbolic and tangible object with a very strong mystical power. It is curious that the words Corona (Crown) and Koran seem to quarrel linguistically on the common etymological root, but in the end they rejoin together on the road of Memory, in the deepest sense of the term. Traditional historians supported the eastern origin of this kind of prayers, anyway St. Domenico of Guzman introduced the meditated recitation of the Holy Rosary and divulged it with his first groups of friars. The Rosary becomes Memory and at the same time evocation and tangibility. It becomes Word, Rhythm and Music, which is directed to the practice of ascesis. The intent of the work is to vivify the devotional practice through the connection between Music, Singing and Word, melted in an ancestral rhythm. Besides being a practical support to prayer, it is also an “object” of art which carries on the thin thread of memory the invitation to be brought deeply in contact with the heart of the Chosen Woman, the Goddess-Woman, the Divine Mirror, the hiatus which blends Heaven and Earth. Several artists participated to this project: the famous actor Francesco Carnelutti, the reciting voice of the Rosary Mysteries in Latin; the composer Roberto Caravella who proposes three touching meditations for solo voices, viola d’Amore, violoncello concertante, strings and organ.

In making this libretto the composer has avoided the works of fiction and drawn only on Abelard's Historia Calamitatum in which he tells the tragic story in an open ""Letter to a Friend"", his letters to Heloise, and most of all on Heloise's passionate letters to Abelard. Two of Abelard's Latin Hymns, written at her request for Heloise and the nuns of the Paraclete, are included; also his Planctus or Lament and a tenth-century love-song, both sung in English, and a popular Latin song for the Students. Heloise emerges as the stronger and more remarkable character, despite Abelard's eminence as a philosopher, his brilliance and magnetism: students flocked to hear him from all parts. Heloise herself was a distinguished scholar and later became the renowned Abbess of the Paraclete and founded six daughter houses. She was revered and beloved by everyone. But the Cantata is concerned only with her relationship to Abelard, and ends with his death. The Cantata is in Nine Sections.

His fifteen symphonies captured not only the evolution of the musical genius. It feels as if the entire 20th century with its great discoveries and perturbations, progress and catastrophes breathes in his scores. These striking documents of human spirit will continue to tell us long stories about their time causing heated theoretical and aesthetic discussions; they will be giving us reasons for very diverse interpretations, inspiring admiration or sharp rejection, but they will never leave their listeners untouched. Each of the symphonies by Shostakovich was a major event of the country’s musical and, even broader, cultural life of the nation. Even barely performed and published ones, they entered the repertoire of the greatest conductors of their time. The name of Alexander Sladkovsky ranks high among contemporary Russian conductors. The recognized interpreter of contemporary music and People’s Artist of Russia, Sladkovsky gained prominence after he took charge of Tatarstan’s symphony orchestra in 2010.

The pianist titled it Reminiscenza not only after Nikolai Medtner’s sonata of the same name, but also because all the compositions on it were particularly dear to her and played an important part in her life. Beethoven’s enigmatic thirtieth sonata dedicated to the daughter of his “Immortal Beloved” Antonie Brentano; Schumann’s restless and impetuous Kreisleriana inspired with the images of Hoffmann’s fantasy and the composer’s passionate love for Clara Wieck; Ravel’s refined and a bit ironic Noble and Sentimental Waltzes; and Medtner’s intimate and lyric Sonata-reminiscenza, which the composer considered his “true creative success” – all these works united through the spirit of romantic dream sound in an amazingly delicate way, in an atmosphere of nostalgic melancholy. “Each of the four compositions on this disc ends in a pianissimo not to scare the Reminiscences away” the pianist said.

A perfect example of the creativity and diversity of Antonio Vivaldi's musicmaking, the opera Dorilla in Tempe is an enchanting listen. From the pastoral and fairytale-like atmosphere of the story, to the prominent role of the choir (which sings the wellknown 'Spring') and the insertion of several spectacular arias by fellow composers (thereby creating a ‘pasticcio' opera, as was common at the time): everything combines to draw the listener in to the emotional twists and turns of Princess Dorilla in her valley of Tempe, Greece. As always in the Vivaldi Edition, the recording brings together a high-level vocal cast, including Romina Basso, Sonia Prina, Christian Senn, and Serena Malfi - this time under the baton of maestro Diego Fasolis, who has previously worked with Cecilia Bartoli on several recordings.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=OP30560,Classical,,France,"RSI Radiotelevisione svizzera & naive, a label of Believe Group","naive, a label of Believe Group",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This album is about the human condition and the pursuit of light in darkness. A setting of Sara Teasdale’s “Nights Without Sleep,” for voice and piano commences the album’s journey of introspection. Then there is Three Madrigals—“There is a Lady Sweet and Kind,” combines the elegance of the English art song with the character of a Stephen Foster folk tune; the performance of “The Silver Swan,” a dark Irish ballad of sorts, is evocative of the Leontyne Price recordings of Samuel Barber’s art songs; “Love Me Not for Comely Grace,” embodies its text, demonstrating the sweet, yet complicated burden of affections. Following is “Is This the Cost?” an elegiac exemplar of Baxter’s flair for dramatic writing derived from Act II, Scene II of his opera Lily (Lisa VanAuken, librettist). Four Views of Love begins with “When You Are Old,” a reflective setting of the classic Yeats text. Be prepared for an incredible climax that expresses fully the ranges of the piano and the human voice trailed by blissful catharsis. Closing the album is Skywriting, a cycle “drawing on words by Linda Pastan.” In the composer’s own words—“[Pastan’s] poems have so often touched me so deeply and in such a very personal way that it feels as if she has been listening to my thoughts.

This track’s rhythmic dexterity hints at Klein’s background as a film/media composer, foreshadowing the complexity of the dark, ethnographic “Myth of Tomorrow,” an exploration of the keyboard percussion instruments and the distinctive aspects of the harp. The first movement of the energetic “Hoboken Suite” transpires when flute and free-bass accordion engage in a battle of sonorities, highlighted by the warm depth of strings and bass clarinet woodwinds. It is a cliffhanger with no resolve, and still none is given even in the haunting opening of Movement II, when the tempo is dramatically cut in half. In the similar realm is the rhapsodic “Dream Fragments” a sonata for piano—each hand, at times, so independent one might wonder if two pianos are in effect. “1899” is a pensive survey of the Americana themes of Klein’s predecessors directed by the reminiscent harmonies of the atmospheric woodwinds and vibraphones that have been catalysts for the album so far. Following is “Parallels,” a “tonal and atonal hybrid,” a play on anxiety and confusion. Perhaps the most unexpected gem of this incredible album is the guitar duet “Four Journeys.” There is a subtle dance with modal mixture, providing exquisite chord progressions and arrival points reminiscent of the sweetest of Renaissance madrigals. When the dust settles, it is with a startling jolt.“Hidden Places” is the icing on the cleverly syncopated cake.

Using music, rather than words, to tell his story, Crozier’s music is full of startling detail and narrative. The two pieces comprising this album serve as windows into Crozier’s theory of musical story telling. Listeners are challenged to find a better narrative voice than the delicate oboe positioned against the profound strings. Specifically, one feels this texture in Ballade: A Tale after the Brothers Grimm, rendered exquisitely by the Slovak National Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Stanislav Vavrinek. The piece flows with scenery and drama experienced through, what Crozier has referred to as, “three ideas” representing characters whose interaction creates the story of the piece. His compositions have been praised by both The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal. The Baltimore Sun wrote, “Composer Crozier has responded … with music of extraordinary depth and power.” Crozier’s movement, “Capriccio” (performed by the Seattle Symphony Orchestra and conducted by Gerard Schwarz) was awarded first prize in the Jacksonville Symphony Orchestra’s Fresh Ink competition for Florida composers.

Throughout his career Debussy sought new ways to express his musical vistas. He began numerous large compositional projects and between these big ventures wrote miniatures such as songs and piano pieces. Debussy’s 24 piano preludes were published in two sets in 1910 and 1913. These miniatures are varied in character and style, and include, among others, references to literature, poetry, nature, the Mediterranean landscape and the events in Paris during Debussy’s lifetime. The six pieces forming the cycle Children’s Corner (1908) evoke adult recollections of childhood. The set bears a dedication to Debussy’s daughter Chouchou and includes some of Debussy’s most well-known piano pieces, including The Snow is Dancing and Golliwogg’s cake walk.

Led by director Robert McCormick, Professor of Music at the University of South Florida in Tampa, the percussion orchestra re-imagines original compositions from five key contemporary classical composers. The first series of compositions come from John Liberatore. Titled This Living Air, the four-movement composition is a collage of percussion instruments played with the sort of delicacy and innocence that is reminiscent of childhood. The experimental compositions feature the circular frolic of glockenspiel and marimbas with Ko’s piano melodies dancing in the center. Seunghee Lee composed the second track, Pung-Kyung. Experimental in nature, Ko’s piano treads curiously along as the percussion group accentuates sudden strikes of sound in the xylophone, hand drums, and wood blocks. The next track Solstice, originally penned by Hilary Tann, features five acts, starting with the solemn, melancholic “Breakup ‘Imperceptible Dissolution’” following through three acts to the epic conclusion of the ‘Freeze-Up “Icy Silvers and Darts.” The McCormick Percussion Group rounds out their album with the moody, sullen Dark Paradise by composer Ciro Scotto, followed quickly by the erratic chaos of Matt Barber’s Kid Stuff: Five Figments for Piano and Percussion.

She and cellist Sebastian Baverstam make up Jupiter Duo, and have performed together for many years since Baverstam was 12 years old. They perform Cohen’s highly expressive music with an unbridled intensity, and have a reputation for having a close musical connection. Cohen channels her interest in spiritual and mystical ideas into her music. To start, the name “Jupiter Duo” draws from Roman mythology and astrology to describe the close connection between her and Baverstam. Querying the Silence confronts the loneliness and grief in the face of loss and unyielding silence. Third Vigil for cello and piano, originally for orchestra, is a mystical concerto, written with challenging parts especially for Cohen and Baverstam. It tackles the place of humanity in the universe and eternity—the human world being but a residual echo of the spiritual world. In Vol. 1, Ser. 7 of Book of Prayers, Cohen parses the visceral emotions and states of being humanity experiences in trying to connect further with the Divine. The pieces are heart-rending, once again tackling the echo of sound into silence. This is music that should be heard by many.

Kemper combines acoustic instruments and electronics to create meditative compositions that explore the connections between real and imaginary worlds. Kemper writes that “myths represent traces of our collective imagination, and similarities between myths from different cultures point to a shared human experience.” The title work Mythical Spaces concerns the liminal space between physical and mythical locations, both of natural and human construction. Amplified vessels evoke specific spaces in each of the five movements, such as an amplified pot of dirt in “Underground” and a wooden bowl in “Forest.” Lament for flute and computer responds to the poem “A History of Lament.” Drawing from the text’s evocation of the myth of Orpheus, Kemper explores the transitions between the world of the living and the underworld. In Illa Tempore bridges not only geographical space, but temporal space as well. The piece quotes Monteverdi’s Missa in illo tempore. This music of the past is juxtaposed with technology of the future—the musical robots AMI and CARI designed and built by Expressive Machines Musical Instruments, co-founded by Kemper. AMI and CARI produce a backdrop of shifting drones, upon which a saxophone and bassoon employ a variety of extended performance techniques. The album closes with The Seven Stars for prepared piano, a piece devoted to the mythology of stars, the constellations. Each of the work’s seven movements portrays a star in the Big Dipper, with musical intensities that correspond to each star’s apparent magnitude.

Tchaikovsky toyed with the public on the meaning of his final symphony, proclaiming an underlying program existed, but refusing to disclose it. His death shortly after its premiere brought a perfect storm of mystery and intrigue, leaving an imaginative public to proclaim this work was his suicide note. According to Bernard, ""Once inside the score, you feel the work’s immense scale and relentless passion—and become aware that the life force needed to create such a work simply could not exist within a person resigned to take his own life. The work speaks for itself, revealing a clear narrative from the first note to the last. Movement-by-movement you hear Tchaikovsky recalling and reimagining his life’s work through a much more mature and effective lens. We hear Romeo and Juliet, then his ballet waltzes and finally his symphonic finales all reworked with a more focused clarity and sense of purpose from an older Tchaikovsky who has finally found his authentic voice. The symphony’s apotheosis in its final movement portrays Tchaikovsky seeing time robbing him of his new found voice. You can feel every pang of Tchaikovsky’s emotion in finding and then losing his voice---including elation, pain, passion, ecstasy and regret, finally escorting Tchaikovsky through acceptance as he is silenced by the limits of time. It is here, at the end of the symphony, where entire program is revealed, and Tchaikovsky’s true voice is understood.""",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=RC2059912,Classical,,United States,Recursive Classics,Recursive Classics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

So it is today that the repertoire has been enriched with works by the most important composers of the 20th and 21st centuries. Transcription for solo guitar has also evolved considerably since the first half of the 20th century: from a ‘melodic instrument allowing harmony,’ as Andres Segovia defined it, the guitar has become an instrument allowing polyphony.

British Composer Anthony Herschel Hill who died last year also features here for the first time with Nocturne, a beautiful if intense elegy for two pianos, and a tribute to a composer of among many other works, 24 Symphonies and 14 Concertos whose true worth is yet to be fully appreciated.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=SOMMCD%200178,Classical,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As in the first boxed set, the live atmosphere of these unedited performances shines through, revealing the true ambiance of the Chicago Blues club scene in the mid-1970s, as well as the individuals whose talents MCM Records would preserve. They captured an authenticity that rarely surfaced on the major label recordings that some of these artists made. MCM was a labour of love by a young French woman, Marcelle Chailleux, and her future husband, Jacques Morgantini. A recent blues convert, Marcelle traveled to Chicago in the mid-1970s to record a unique collection of live performances. Some of these performances presented here were by men, who would become giants of the blues; others were talented artists who never found wider fame, and whose MCM recordings remain the only surviving evidence of their talent. In this superb collection, you will find rare tracks by Eddie Taylor, Big Mojo Elem, Andrew “Blueblood” McMahon, Big Voice Odom, Hip Lankchan, Eddie Clearwater, Jimmy Dawkins, Jimmy Johnson, Magic Slim, John Littlejohn, Bobby King and The Aces.

2018,4010228511727,WER51172,Enjott Schneider,Mystic Landscapes: Symphony No. 5 Schwarzwald-Saga / Symphony NO.6 Der Rhein,Julia Sophie Wagner; Orchestra of the Janacek Opera of the National Theatre Brno; Hansjorg Albrecht,1,CD,WGO,Wergo,14.81,22.99,CN23,"""Mystic Landscapes"" is the eighth of 10 albums in WERGO’s continuing ""Edition Enjott Schneider"".  The Rhine and the Black Forest are mystical and legendary landscapes that throughout the world are seen as inspirations for German Romanticism. Enjott Schneider conceived this recording as a tribute to these landscapes, not as illustrative program music, but as an attempt to capture a certain mood in sound. Both symphonies have a strongly biographical background and are musical embodiments of personal memories of the composer.  Not without a certain tongue-in-cheek intent, the music in Symphony No. 5 ""Black Forest Saga"" sometimes takes on an archaic tone that presents the Black Forest in the context of films depicting Celtic legends. The choral effects are sometimes distilled into Romantic vocalises or onomatopoeic sounds like the whistling of the wind or the rustling of leaves. As literary material Enjott Schneider used texts from the poem ""Der Mummelsee"" by August Schnezler. The “Romantic” central sections of the river between Mainz and Cologne are sometimes considered symbolic of Germany itself and have long inspired poets, painters, and visitors from around the world. In four movements the Symphony No. 6 ""The Rhine"" thematicizes different moods and atmospheres of this legendary river.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=WER51172,Classical,,Austria,2017 Wergo,2017 Wergo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2018,4010228735529,WER73552,Chaya Czernowin,Hidden,Inbal Hever; Jack Quartet; Carlo Laurenzi; Jeremie Henrot,1,CD,WGO,Wergo,14.81,22.99,CN23,"Chaya Czernowin has developed a musical language in which space and gesture are the focus of her compositional interest: the discovery of musical changes in perspective that irritate and can sometimes be misleading. The listener never knows which musical gestures will come into focus and which will fade into the background. The compositional organization of space and time plays an important role in ""HIDDEN"", Chaya Czernowin’s quartet for strings and electronics. This is a work that deals with things unseen: things that are never revealed in their entirety, and can only be perceived (if they are perceived at all) as shadowy intimations. Czernowin says, "" ‘HIDDEN’ is a slowly unfolding, 45-minute listening experience that permits our ears to turn into eyes. Our ears are given space and time to become accustomed to a totally unpredictable territory of sound. "" As Chaya Czernowin has explained, she wanted to create an “Etude in Fragility” with her cycle of works for voice and breath.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=WER73552,Classical,,Austria,2017 Wergo,2017 Wergo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Each of the four has its own pace, vibe and character. The music is light and cheerful and sometimes with a wink. Benjamin Britten completed in 1939 a 3-part violin concert. It is characterized by virtuoso passages and lyrics. Without any doubt, this works reflects the great concern of Britten about the situation in the world, the increasing hostilities in Europe and Asia. In 1940, the work had its premiere in America, the country where Britten composed the work. After the war, the work was seldom played. In recent years it has gained a lot of popularity. Matthieu van Bellen loves this concerto and is one of the younger violinists who has it on his repertoire.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=ZEF9653,Classical,,Netherlands,Zefir Records,Zefir Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
