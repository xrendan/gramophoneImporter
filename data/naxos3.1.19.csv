The Requiem in Andrew Smith's version, commissioned by the choir, is loosely based on the Roman Catholic mass for the dead. Several of the texts of the traditional Requiem Mass have been replaced, however, with biblical references to the tragic fate of children, reflecting the all-too-frequent conflicts of today in which the young are innocent victims. The musical material in the Requiem takes its inspiration from Gregorian chant. Melodic fragments of the ancient requiem mass can be heard in the background. Trygve Seim's improvising saxophone makes up an integral part of the whole, yet lives a life of its own in close companionship with the singers and Stle Storlkken on organ. The palette is expanded with the glorious strings of TrondheimSolistene in Stle Kleiberg's Hymn to Love and The Light (with Petra Bjrkhaug, organ). These works add dimensions of faith, hope and love. And light too, when all seems dark. In life there are moments to treasure, and challenges to overcome.

In many cases, this was because of circumstances rather than devotion and could not be described as voluntary: at the time, the dowry that a brides family was expected to pay her groom on marriage had become incredibly large and hence in many cases unaffordable. According to Robert L. Kendrick (Celestial Sirens, 1996), as many as 75% of the daughters of some aristocratic families in Milan became nuns around the turn of the 17th century; in the second half of the 17th century, the percentage was 48%. The nuns of some convents were very well known in the surrounding community and had both an inner church for their own devotions and an outer church that visitors could attend. These two churches were separated by a wall, so that there was no visual contact between the nuns and the visitors. Sound, on the other hand  speech and song  passed freely through openings near the ceiling. The early music ensemble Earthly Angels was founded by Kajsa Dahlback in 2016 for her second doctoral concert at the Sibelius Academy, University of the Arts Helsinki. Nowadays Earthly Angels consists of early music professionals from around Europe with a solid core of Finnish top players. It is an ensemble of high profile for vocal chamber music mainly from the 17th and 18th centuries and looks forward to many groundbreaking projects in the future. Earthly Angels focuses on a close, embodied relationship between text and music, on finding new interesting music from the early music repertoire and on making the early music meaningful for audiences today.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=ABCD%20426&medium=phydig,01 Classical,Classical,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As we know, its origin is in the faith and spirituality of Olivier Messiaen, who described it as: The Contemplation of the Child-God in the cradle, and the gazes fixed upon Him: from the inexpressible Gaze of God the Father to the multiple Gaze of the Church of love, also taking in the unheard Gaze of the Spirit of joy, the tender Gaze of the Virgin, of the Angels, of the Magi, and of those creatures that are immaterial or symbolic (Time, Extreme Height, Silence, the Star, the Cross). He continues: It is a complex of sounds destined for perpetual variations, pre-existing in the abstract as a series, but very concrete and easy to recognize by their colours: a steely grey-blue traversed by bright red and orange, a mauve-tinted violet spotted with leather-brown and encircled in deep purple.

His Pome de lamour et de la mer is a unique score for the period and certainly his greatest work; simultaneously a profane, naturistic cantata, a monologue, and a song cycle, it was composed between 1882 and 1892 to poetry by Maurice Bouchor, a longstanding friend of Chausson. Vronique Gens is recording this cycle for the first time, although she has already issued Le temps des lilas with Susan Manoff at the piano for her album Nre, about which Ernst Van Bek wrote in Classiquenews: Chaussons Le temps des lilas mesmerises with the nuancing of its colors, the allusive precision of every sung word: this ecstatic, depressive prayer represents another peak of French post-Wagnerianism. The song uninterruptedly expresses the profound, accursed languor of overcharged spirits. The tact and sense of style that Gens displays, is proof of her remarkably acute understanding of the veiled references. Clment Taillia, in Forum Opera, spoke of all the art of a song that desires to express itself Vronique Gens talent is equally on display in this recording too, with the Orchestre National de Lille  an orchestra she already knows well  under Alexandre Bloch, its new chief conductor, whose appointment and first concerts and recordings have already caused a sensation.

But this sensual statue is highly flammable if you consider that Manu Katch also knows about dancing  he practiced it as a kid, goes out dancing in clubs and after all, you need all four limbs to play the drums he himself remarks.

Cuil came upon his sleeping wife and perceived that the expression of joy and peace on her face was caused by the sound of the wind through the bones and sinew, and he knew that if he could build an instrument which captured this he would be able to keep his wife contented. Canoclach awoke to the sound of her husband playing beautiful music on the newly created instrument.

2019,Arcana,A459,3760195734599,Johann Sebastian Bach; Domenico Gabrielli ,Mauro Valli: Bach in Bologna,Mauro Valli,3,CD,29.63,29.63,"Bach and Gabrielli: the focus of this recording is an unusual musical match involving the famous 6 Suites for violoncello solo by Johann Sebastian Bach and the little-known 7 Ricercari for violoncello solo (1689) by Domenico Gabrielli of Bologna, the first example of a work for unaccompanied cello in history, and thus the only precedent and possible model for the Bach masterpiece. In what ways are the two series of compositions linked? Cellist Mauro Valli is convinced that there is a connection between the two for a number of reasons, including the preponderant correspondence of the keys. Bach assiduously performed and transcribed works by Italian composers, not only those of his contemporaries but also of earlier musicians, so it is highly likely that he was familiar with Gabriellis works, in particular with the Ricercari. Mauro Valli provides an intriguingly new interpretation of Bachs six masterpieces by heralding each one with the corresponding Ricercare. The outcome is strikingly fresh and original, with a wealth of courageously personal diminutions and embellishments that derive from Vallis deep knowledge of the Italian baroque repertoire. Bach was fascinated by composers such as Frescobaldi, Albinoni and Vivaldi, and it certainly makes good sense to perform his Suites in the Italian style!",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=A459&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Netherlands,"2019 Mauro Valli, under exclusive licence to Outhere Music France",2019 Outhere Music France,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Constructed in the shadow of the earlier books, each one of its songs makes reference either in its music or text to another song from those earlier books.

Two titans of the musical world encountered each other in a one of a kind duel. A musical trial of strength in front of a select audience, the objective of which was to choose the winner by the intensity of the applause. The suitable stage for this exclusive event was provided by the friend and benefactor of Mozart, Baron Raimund Wetzlar zu Plankenstern. At just 28 years old, Ludwig van Beethoven was already well known as a virtuoso of the pianoforte and master of improvisation. Beethoven's opponent, 25 year old Johann Joseph Baptist Woelfl from Salzburg, was a student of Leopold Mozart and no less successful in the local musical scene. Both of them had made their first successful appearances at the age of only seven years and competed to win the favor of the Viennese public. Exceptionally gifted pianist Luisa Imorde reawakens the spirit of this historic battle between the two musical geniuses on her new album LAffaire dhonneur. Like Beethoven, Imorde made her first musical steps in the surroundings of Bonn. By the age of seven, she had already performed on stage time and again. Now she has made Salzburg the center of her work and life, like originally Mozart and Woelfl. Her first recording named Zirkustnze found high appraisal by the musical press and the public alike. Now she presents her second album. Mrs. Imorde contrasts the variations of Woelfl and Beethoven over the same musical theme by Salieri La stessa, la stessissima, they open and finish this recording. In addition to that, Mozarts visionary Adagio and Fugue for two pianos, pave the way to the future. Jacques Rouvier, former teacher of Luisa Imorde at the University of Music Mozarteum, Salzburg, plays the second piano. Then follows Beethoven with his famous Pathtique. Contrasting to that, Woelfl, who in fact was a great admirer of Beethoven, takes over form and material of the Pathtique and tries to even surpass it in his Sonata in C minor.",https://youtu.be/CRWHQmv7pws,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=0301162BC&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Classical Era,Germany,2019 Edel Germany GmbH,2019 Edel Germany GmbH,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Daniel Rhn brings the jerky flickering images and the high spirited, extravagant hurly-burly to musical life with romantic sounds from Rachmaninoff through the evergreens of Kurt Weill to the jazzy echoes of Gershwin. ""That era was a positive melting pot of creativity and inventiveness,"" explains Rhn. Jazz was emerging. Silent movies were being replaced by the talkies. And while Walt Disney's Mickey Mouse was taking his first steps in 1928, the dream factories in Berlin and Hollywood were doing a roaring trade thanks to Fritz Lang and Charlie Chaplin. The violin virtuoso is focusing on a topic that has recently been in the public eye, not just as a result of popular TV productions. Rhn's personal role model, the patron of violinists Jascha Heifetz, is both the inspiration and the godfather of The Golden Violin. Absolute perfection, paired with unique creative energy and an inimitable touch. ""When I was six year old, I could just about (standing on a box on tip-toe) reach Vol. 1 of my father's Heifetz collection. And that volume contained the complete acoustic recordings of 1917-1924, full of straight-to-the-heart arrangements and popular melodies."" It is precisely those melodious evergreens that he has now recorded with the Wrttemberg Chamber Orchestra under its American principal conductor Case Scaglione.

It is not a cello concerto as such, but rather a concertante work for cello and soloists from other cultures. With a playing time of roughly an hour, Nomaden (Nomads) is made up of 38 brief sections, most of which run into each other without any pause. Two types of musical material run like a thread through the work: the Nomad-music which return eight times but always presented each time in a different light, and the so called Passages: static episodes on one or two tones (or a chord) that explore the various instrumental timbres. These lead into the various main episodes featuring encounters between the cello and the instruments from other cultures. Bons composed the work for Queyras and the Atlas Ensemble  a group he himself founded in 2002, made up of 18 eminent musicians from China, Japan, Central Asia, the Middle East and Europe. From the Japanese shakuhachi and Chinese erhu to the Armenian duduk and the Persian setar, the scoring offers an untold number of combinations and an unheard spectrum of timbres. Nomaden was premired by these performers in 2016, under the baton of Ed Spanjaard, and has been awarded the prestigious 2019 Grawemeyer Award for Music Composition.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grO47U-3M20,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=BIS-2073&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Classical Crossover,EU,2018 BIS Records,2018 BIS Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When did he compose them, and why, and for whom? In what circumstances were they performed? And why would a master of polyphony choose to write for a melody instrument with limited scope for polyphony or chords? We can only guess at the answers  which makes the works all the more fascinating. The legendary violinist George Enescu famously described the set as the Himalayas of violinists, but for more than 200 years they were primarily regarded as pedagogical exercises rather than compositions worthy of the concert hall. Felix Mendelssohn and Robert Schumann tried to popularize them by making versions with piano accompaniment, while Busoni did away with the violin altogether in his transcription of the famous Chaconne from Partita No. 2. But since Yehudi Menuhin made the first complete recording of the Sonatas and Partitas, between 1929 and 1936, they have become a staple during violin recitals, on album and in concert. Fascinating performers and audiences alike with their architectural perfection as well as their emotional range, these are works that lend themselves to very different interpretations, and on this recording it is the Bach of Finnish violinist Jaakko Kuusisto we hear. Himself a composer  as well as violinist and conductor  Kuusisto remembers beginning to study individual movements from the set at the age of ten. The music has been with him ever since, and to him no other works for the violin provide a higher challenge or greater beauty.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=BIS-2197&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Violin,EU,2018 BIS Records,2018 BIS Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For his first album featuring solo works by Beethoven, Sudbin has chosen the two final sonatas and the Six Bagatelles, Op. 126  late works written between 1821 and 1824, just a couple of years before the composers death. There are numerous anecdotes that testify to the fact that Beethoven was highly temperamental. But in his liner notes to this disc, Sudbin writes of another, contrasting side to the composer: warmth, generosity and wisdom  with unexpected outbursts of cheeky humour  are also unmistakably among Beethovens qualities and particularly evident in the works on this recording. If Beethovens 32 piano sonatas form one of the most important collections of works in the history of music, then the final ones belong to his crowning achievements. Various musicians and musicologists have commented on them, hearing a hard-won triumph of the spirit in the great fugue of the final movement of Op. 110, and interpreting Op. 111  and especially its second movement, the famous Arietta  as a last farewell. The set of Bagatelles was composed only months after Beethoven had completed his monumental Ninth Symphony. It became the last work for piano to be published in his lifetime, and together the six brief pieces form a distillate of a lifetime of writing for and playing the piano.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=BIS-2208&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Piano,EU,2018 BIS Records,2018 BIS Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Golovin was organizing a celebration of the recent coronation in Moscow of Tsar Peter II, and naturally wanted music to add to the festivities. His six years in London  where he made the acquaintance of Handel among others  and subsequent experience as assistant court Kapellmeister, made Roman the obvious choice for the count. The result was Golovinmusiken (The Golovin Music), an autograph score consisting of 45 movements of varying lengths. These are the facts as we know them, and everything else is conjecture: Romans manuscript lacks vital instructions regarding instrumentation, dynamics or tempi, and although the first three movements are in four parts, the rest are in three parts or (in a few cases) two. When a performing edition was being prepared in the 1980s, the editors came to the conclusion that the material was in fact incomplete, and a second violin part was added. It was also deemed that the order of the movements was probably not the one in which they would have been performed. The edition in question formed the basis for a partial recording of the work, comprising 22 movements. 290 years after Count Golovins feast, as Dan Laurin and his colleagues in Hr Barock recorded the complete work, their approach was a different one. Making use of a total of 18 different instruments  from sopranino recorder and oboe da caccia to bassoon, strings and baroque guitar  and featuring highly imaginative continuo playing from Anna Paradiso at the harpsichord, their performance sounds as full and varied as one might wish for, without any added parts.

Proust describes, for instance, the salon of Mme Verdurin. Salons were something more than merely a meeting place for the society. Today we would call them institutions operating in the art market. It was in salons that new works were commented upon, artists judged, and leading trends in music were established. Salons run by women played a special role in the 19th century. One of these was the Petersburg salon maintained in 182731 by the famous Polish artist Maria Szymanowska, official court pianist to the Tsarinas Maria Feodorovna and Yelisaveta Alexeievna of Russia. Three years after Maria Szymanowskas death (or a bit earlier) another woman artist was born in Mlawa (Mazovia region). It was Tekla Badarzewska, author of more than a dozen piano miniatures, who gained fame with her Maidens Prayer, published in Warsaw in 1856 with the subheading a melody for piano.  In the year of the composition of The Maidens Prayer, a would-be mistress of the piano was born in Warsaw  Natalia Janotha, who followed in Szymanowskas footsteps, giving concerts worldwide and collecting the titles of court pianist. Neither the name of Leokadia Myszynska-Wojciechowska nor that of Helena Krzyzanowska, nearly ten years her junior, can be found in course books of Polish music history  though they well deserve a place in such publications.

It took me until 2002 to go to Alaska and visit Valdez and the Kenai Peninsula. I was blown away by the beauty of Alaska and the uniqueness of the folks that live there.

In 2015 and 2016 I got to visit Kodiak Island, which left a lifetime impression on me. The songs on this album were written in Alaska over the years of my trips to this wilderness state. When planning this albums recording session, I asked Bob Magnusson to play bass, because we share the love of musical elegance and simplicity- and because I truly love Bobs bass sound (like so many others before me).

The breadth of ideas is limitless. Each variation tells a whole story, and for all that some are connected in mood, it is no mean feat as a performer to respect the huge scope of Beethovens vision.

The cast was led by the works brilliant young choreographer, Roland Petit, and conducted by Andr Cluytens. Saugets wide-ranging influences, notably the orchestration of Richard Strauss as well as the works of Satie and les Six, give his work a flowing, openly melodic style that is immediately appealing and full of wit and charm. Following the success of Les Forains, and the formal establishment in October 1945 of Les Ballets des Champs-lyses, Roland Petit and Boris Kochno devised a number of new ballets for the company.

Prelude En Fa Diseur Mineur is a slow, sorrowful intro, with harmonies that are modern but always tonal. Everything builds up and then recedes a number of times, as the emotive qualities of the piece rise and fall. The following Prelude en Sol Mineur is dedicated to the memory of Roland Dyens, and although it begins quietly and sadly, it soon develops into a frantic, fast-paced piece reminiscent of Dyens' legendary technique. Sonata Campanas De La Esperanza is in three movements. The ""Theme"" immediately demands attention with its Spanish opening. This then evolves into an arpeggiated passage that goes through a number of uneasy and often nervously emotive ideas before linking into the tremolo-laden ""Plainte."" The ""Final"" is jerky and insistent and centered often on one repeated note before it reaches a dramatic strumming close. After four varied Preludes come a busy and exciting Tarantella and the final three-movement Sonata No. 2, Hommage a Paco de Luca.

Apart from Chopin there are many other Polish composers from which probably only a few are known  Paderewski, Moniuszko, maybe Szymanowski. In the series of compositions by M. Papara one can hear many sound clusters. Sometimes it was even necessary to use the entire piano keyboard in order to produce them.

Whilst the messages of the Symphony have been subject to a variety of often conflicting interpretations, the music and vivid orchestral writing, to which the Halle live performance fully attests, have earned it a leading place in the composers legacy. In coupling the Symphony with the Four Romances which immediately pre-date it, Elder sheds light on his interpretation of the meaning of the Symphony. The latter work quotes thematic material used in the first of the Pushkin settings in which faith is expressed that art can survive even the most brutal oppression and desecration, perhaps revealing an element of pride that the composer had been true to his art in the face of state threats.

This golden volume has something for everyone: symphonic Romanticism, allusions to Surrealism and Abstract Art, and virtuosic solos performance, not to mention the unlikely pairing of a rock group with wind band. The music of Spanish composer Luis Serrano Alarcon bookends the album, starting with his B-Side Concerto. A rock/jazz fusion band and the symphonic wind ensemble tackle and support each other over the course of three sections in a concerto that Vivaldi could never have imagined. Nigel Clarkes Mysteries of the Horizon was inspired by the artwork of Rene Magritte, and the four movements are named after some of his most popular paintings. The performance features the virtuosic cornet soloist, also from Belgium, Harmen Vanhoorne, whom the composer had in mind while writing this dazzling work. Another British composer and another work inspired by art follow; this time Kit Turnbull and Wassily Kandinsky respectively. The title, Everything starts from a dot, is a direct quote from Kandinsky when answering a question about how he goes about starting a painting. Staying with Russia for the final work on the album, Serrano Alarcons Second Symphony for Wind Orchestra pays tribute to the era of Russian Romantic symphonic composers.

Following the groups first album, Daniel Isoir and his ensemble now offer their interpretation of works that have often been featured in their concert programmes: the two piano quartets. A fusion of the concerto and the quartet, these works are rarely performed and there are surprisingly few recordings available of them, particularly on period instruments. Concerto-like in form and built on a dialogue between the piano and the string trio, they unfold in the more private, secluded and intimate atmosphere of chamber music, whilst retaining the extrovert brilliance of the concerto. The quartet for piano, violin, viola and cello was a completely new ensemble at the end of the 18th century and in fact was invented by Mozart himself. Dating from 1785 and 1786, and therefore contemporary with The Marriage of Figaro, these two piano quartets formed part of a series of three commissioned by the publisher Franz Anton Hoffmeister. However, Hoffmeisters difficulty in selling the first quartet, which was judged to be technically too demanding for amateur musicians, led him to abandon the project, although he agreed to let the composer keep the advance on his fee. In these two quartets Mozart achieves a perfect balance between the piano and the strings, the instruments now combining, now alternating throughout the score. At times, the fortepiano plays alone, albeit fleetingly. The first quartet is more tragic than the second, while the latter has greater luminosity and warmth.

A case of history coming full circle! For their first album, these young soloists boldly launched head first into the vast repertoire of two of the greatest Russian composers: Tchaikovsky and Shostakovich. The two quartets performed here were composed almost a century apart. Tchaikovsky was at the height of his powers and had yet to write his most famous works when he composed his String Quartet No. 2. Throughout his life he was to refer to it as one of his best works, the music having poured effortlessly and joyfully, being written practically at one sitting. Shostakovichs String Quartet No. 8 was written in Dresden in 1960 and was dedicated to the victims of fascism and war. At the time he composed the piece, Shostakovich was going through a troubled period both in his personal life and in his relations with the Soviet authorities. The composer was so satisfied with this clearly autobiographical piece that he subsequently dedicated it to himself. The musicians of the David Oistrakh Quartet throw themselves body and soul into this incredibly poignant and intense music.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=MU-011&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Austria,2016 Off The Records,2016 Off The Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Together they explore in this first album a broad, cosmopolitan repertory from several centuries, in which the virtuosity of the language of the violin is amplified by the technical evolution that blossomed in the late 18th century and by the emotion that different composers sought to put into music. The Russian repertory predominates in this recording with the famous Vocalise of Rachmaninov as well as three works of Tchaikovsky, all composed within three years of each other. In the French repertory, two composers with quite similar musical styles and ideas are on the programme: Maurice Ravel with his highly daunting concert rhapsody Tzigane and Claude Debussy with his tender Clair de Lune.

The Second, composed two years later, corresponds to Griegs return to Norway and his marriage; the composer expresses here a honeymoon: there is love and of course dance, the central figure of Griegs music. Another 20 years would pass before the Third Sonata was born after a difficult gestation; no doubt the most often played albeit the most demanding, the folklore is secondary to a more adventurous expressive research, to more elaborate harmonies and some uncommon displays of power.

On Schoenberg Piano Music And His 17 Fragments, pianist Yoko Hirota performs three of Schoenbergs completed works along with the 17 fragments that he never brought to completion. Hirota, praised as being precise and keenly projective and demonstrating the highest level of proficiency, is one of the leading interpreters of contemporary piano repertory, and she brings Schoenbergs compositions to life with conviction. The three pieces that make up Drei Klavierstckes op.11 demonstrate Schoenbergs burgeoning awareness that, as a corollary to the atonal structures he was beginning to use, more emotionally stringent use of the piano made for fertile musical ground. A close examination of the 17 fragments illustrates the composers preoccupation with and research into expressivity and color in his piano music  elements that are communicated clearly in Hirotas performances. The evolution of Schoenbergs musical thought can be clearly traced in the fragments, which were written throughout the first quarter of the 20th Century. The influence of Brahmsian piano writing is evident in the first four fragments; by the time he had composed the ninth, his demand for articulation had become predominant. The twelfth fragment contains a character dissimilar to both his previous works and fragments, in that the harmonic language is rather tonal and in the vein of Prokofievs works. Schoenbergs priority was the expression of music in the creative process. Through this album, Hirota does not only demonstrates Schoenbergs care for expressivity in music. She highlights the fact that other pianists should strive to present this color and expression in the performance of Schoenbergs works, in order to deliver a performance that is both rich and true to the composers intent.",https://youtu.be/_PFQGHhySwQ,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=NV6214&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Piano,,,2019 Navona Records LLC.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although essentially a minimalist since 1970, he has branched out to embrace and incorporate diverse elements from a variety of aesthetics. Ever-present is the nexus of nature and science, of the mundane and the miraculous. Et in Arcadia ego is, most of all, the invocation of a childhood memory. Inspired by an adventurous journey to the island reserve Martn Garca off the coast of Uruguay, which Cervetti undertook as a young boy of only 7, it illustrates the traveler's awe at reaching a paradisiacal shore. The composer found himself struck with the same sensation years later on the other side of the world, in France, while viewing Nicolas Poussin's Baroque painting of the same name at the Louvre. Both the painting and the musical work present the paradox of not only death within paradise, but deaths vital role in the renewal of life. This meditation on mortality is almost religious in nature and thus sets the stage for Consolamentum, an homage to the Cathar and Albigensian martyrs who suffered persecution by the Catholic Church in 12th-century Southern France. The title alludes to the unique, somewhat mystified sacrament of the former, which was considered an immersion in the Holy Spirit and supposed to bring about absolution from all sin. Plexus, on the other hand, takes the listener back to the realm of science. The minimalist, aleatoric composition mimics a branching network of nerves, being, in its own right, an intricate microcosm of structure and sound.

Freedom to improvise, to create new musical worlds, and to follow his instincts wherever they take him. As a child in Dresden, Germany, Poetzsch received his first piano lessons from his opera singer grandfather, and was soon immersed in the world of Bach, Schubert, and Clementi. But aged ten, a birthday gift from his father  a sheet music book of Frank Sinatra standards  opened his ears to wider musical possibilities, and he was soon playing in the bar next door to his house, improvising and messing around with the structure of songs. Such formative experiences stayed with Poetzsch through his classical training at the Conservatory of Music in Dresden. While studying piano and composition, his spare time was spent playing in jazz and free improvisation bands with friends and colleagues. The result is Remember Tomorrow, an expansive collection of thirteen songs that stand as self-contained worlds; a house with thirteen rooms, and every composition is a little room, says Poetzsch. Music stirs up memories and fragments of remembrance too, and Remember Tomorrow is an attempt to make sense of it all, of bridging that gap between the past and the present. To do so, he stepped out of his comfort zone, adding new elements and instruments to his compositional mix, and simply let his ideas bloom. His approach to experimentation, as with collaboration, is simply to dive in and see what works, to discover through trial and error. Ditto with electronics and his use of samples; despite admitting that hes no expert, the austere, monochromatic moods he captures are far more important than any technical proficiency or purity. It comes back to freedom  to create without restrictions, and to dissolve preconceived notions around genres and instruments. And so Remember Tomorrow is Poetzschs first step away from the staid world of concert halls and a classically harmonic language towards something more contemporary, more individual. My goal was just to take the next step as a composer, and to form a language out of electronics and piano.

Ditto with electronics and his use of samples; despite admitting that hes no expert, the austere, monochromatic moods he captures are far more important than any technical proficiency or purity. It comes back to freedom  to create without restrictions, and to dissolve preconceived notions around genres and instruments. And so Remember Tomorrow is Poetzschs first step away from the staid world of concert halls and a classically harmonic language towards something more contemporary, more individual. My goal was just to take the next step as a composer, and to form a language out of electronics and piano.

2019,Nimbus,NI5975,0710357597527,Julius Rontgen ,"Rontgen: Piano Music, Vol. 4",Mark Anderson ,1,CD,14.81,14.81,"The present recording of piano music by Julius Rntgen (1855-1932), the fourth of an ongoing series, comprises works that span a significant portion of Rntgens compositional lifetime. Fifty-five years separates the first Ballad, Op.6 written in 1873, when the composer was just 17 years old, from the Sonata in C-sharp minor of 1928. This far- ranging chronology gives the listener an informed overview of Rntgens output. This is especially interesting given the fact that he lived through such musically revolutionary times. Rntgens writing style for the piano shows a gift for creating unique sonorities alongside ingenious harmonic invention. In particular, I am intrigued by his ability to create, on the one hand, exquisite and sublime musical moments  such as those found in the major variations of the Variations and Fugue Op.38 - and, on the other, masses of chordal harmony punctuated with rhapsodic episodes. The Ballad No. 3 best represents the latter compositional style with its highly varied textural and emotional contrasts. When Rntgen died in 1932, Donald Francis Tovey wrote, He was an inspiration for the future but with a link to the past. His compositions cover the whole range of music in every art form; they all show consummate mastery in every aspect of technique; even in the most facile there is beauty and wit, each series of works culminate in something that has the uniqueness of a living masterpiece.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=NI5975&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Piano,United Kingdom,2019 Wyastone Estate Limited,2019 Wyastone Estate Limited,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Much of Robert Martins music concerns itself with the human reaction to the faint and fading glimpse of reality that all things will evanesce. Critic Mike Strizic writes: Other modern composers have been content to let dissonance do their work for them, with little thought to resolving that dissonance into a cohesive whole.

Beginning with its Renaissance ancestry as the dulcian, it developed during the Baroque period into an almost indispensable part of the ensemble. Antonio Vivaldi recognized the versatility of the bassoon early on, composing no fewer than 39 concertos for it. But it was in the second half of the century that the bassoon achieved an equal prominence with the other woodwinds. The four delightful works on this album, performed by Jaakko Luoma and the Tapiola Sinfonietta, represent different facets of the Classical period solo repertoire, each of which makes considerable demands on the instrument. W. A. Mozarts Bassoon Concerto was composed in Salzburg in 1774. It is the only one of the five concertos for bassoon composed by Mozart that have survived. It is a bright, sunny piece written at the age of eighteen, in which Mozart reveals himself fully aware of the capabilities of the instrument. J. N. Hummel was a favorite pupil of Mozart, who at an early age demonstrated his skill both a composition and the fortepiano. His Bassoon Concerto, written c. 1805, reveals influences from Haydn, Weber and Mozart. Both Peter von Winter and Gioacchino Rossini were best well-known during their lifetime as composers of operas. Today, Winters woodwind concertos, including his Bassoon Concertino, are his only works that have remained in the concert programmes. Rossinis Bassoon Concerto was allegedly written in 1845 as a graduation piece for a music academy. Although Rossinian in style, the actual origin of the work cannot be verified. Nevertheless, the work is a fine example of its kind among Classical bassoon concertos. Jaakko Luoma has appeared as soloist all over Finland and in Europe. Luoma became member of the Tapiola Sinfonietta in 1993. During the years 199698 he served as solo bassoonist of Orchestre de Paris. Between 2001 and 2003 he also served as solo bassoonist of Rundfunk-Sinfonieorchester Berlin.

Woolf Works recreates the synaesthetic collision ofform and substance in her writings. Each of the three acts springs from one of Woolfs landmark novels: Mrs Dalloway, Orlando and The Waves  but these inspirations are also enmeshed with elements from her letters, essays and diaries. Woolf Works expresses the heart of an artistic life driven to discover a freer, uniquely modern realism, and brings to life Woolfs world of granite and rainbow, where human beings are at once both physical body and uncontained essence. Woolf Works (2015) was Wayne McGregors first full-length work for The Royal Ballet. ""At its creation in 2015, Woolf Works felt like a breakthrough for choreographer Wayne McGregor, adding a new emotional weight to his athletic force and fascination with technology. In this first revival, its even stronger, with Alessandra Ferri luminous as the Virginia Woolf figure Its a thoughtful, heartfelt performance in a ballet that is both intelligent and tender."" (The Independent 4 Stars)Since its premiere in 2015, Wayne McGregors first full-length ballet has won the 2015 Critics Circle award for best classical choreography and the 2016 Olivier Award for best new dance production, while its star, the fiftysomething ballerina Alessandra Ferri, has won an Olivier for outstanding achievement in dance.

His proverbial modesty and his creed of absolute faithfulness to the original work earned him many admirers, especially during his years in Munich as principal conductor of the Symphony Orchestra of Bavarian Radio (196179). Let it be noted that it was less the person Kubelik that was venerated, but rather his interpretation of music: uncompromising concentration on what was essential, unadulterated and relevant in the best sense of the word. Examples of this can be shown by these audio recordings of two of Ludwig van Beethovens best-known works, the Missa Solemnis, in which Beethoven like in no other work thematized his life-long struggle with faith, and the famous Symphony No. 9, which by including a choral movement broke with the conventions of Viennese Classicism like no other symphony of the time and was viewed as a ground-breaking work.

The repertoire spans from Bachs embrace of Italian musical elements in his Aria variata alla maniera italiana, Bartks incorporation of folk elements in his Improvisations on Hungarian Peasant Songs, and Messiaens use of Hindu rhythms in Cantyodjay to the collage of marching bands, sounds of trains and machinery, church hymns, ragtime and blues in Ives first piano sonata.

Bach wrote for solo organ we have no surviving Bach organ concertos with orchestral accompaniment. Contrast this with the 200+ cantatas: of these, 18 feature organ obbligato, which Bach uses as a solo instrument in arias, choral sections and sinfonias. The most obviously conspicuous date to 1726. In May to November of that year, Bach composed six cantatas which assign a prominent solo role to the organ. Most of these are reworkings of movements of lost violin and oboe concertos written in Bachs time at Weimar and Kthen. Why Bach wrote such a number of obbligato organ cantatas in such a short period remains unknown. One possible explanation may lie in Dresden, where Bach had given a concert on the new Silbermann organ in the Sophienkirche in 1725. Some scholars think that, in addition to other organ works, he also performed organ concertos, or at least a few earlier versions of the sinfonias, with obbligato organ and strings in order to show off the organ. From the cantatas mentioned above, along with the related violin and harpsichord concertos, it is perfectly possible to reconstruct a number of three-movement organ concertos of this type. By using this method, we hope to bring some of the music which Bach may have performed in Dresden in 1725 back to life on this release.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=RAM1804&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Austria,2018 Outhere,2018 Outhere,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When he was 25 years old, DHaene began his life-long fascination with gagaku music, or traditional Japanese court music, that has informed his compositional style throughout his career. This study of a musical style different from that of his own culture resulted in what the composer calls paradoxophony or paradoxical coexistence. Exploring deeper territory than standard cultural crossover music might, Music With Silent Aitakes offers a splendid introduction to this distinctive style. On the one hand, he combines the sound of a Western instrumental ensemble with that of a traditional Japanese gagaku orchestra. On the other, he has invented musical material and designed a pitch structure starting from the points of tangency between the two worlds. DHaene also composes with drones, contributing to the overall coherent impression of these compositions. The music on the album is performed by the internationally esteemed Reigakusha Ensemble and by Ensemble Modern, one of the premier new music ensembles in the world. The orchestras are conducted by Kasper De Roo, an internationally renowned interpreter of 20th and 21st-century music. Music With Silent Aitakes clearly exemplifies paradoxophony, in that the listener tends to forget that there were two separate musical worlds at the beginning of the composition. The western ensemble and the gagaku not only coexist, but they enhance one another, opening new sonic and expressive possibilities and guiding the audience into an exciting new musical universe.",https://youtu.be/b1xdxh6ggDE,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=RR8008&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,,,2019 Ravello Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition to the unconventional ways in which the everyday listener is called on to interpret the music, composer David Rosenboom literally uses the action of listening as an instrument. The first track, Portable Gold and Philosophers Stones (Deviant Resonances) (2015), is an epic piece lasting over 35 minutes. Rosenboom achieves a resonant sound by analyzing electrical signals coming from the brains of two imaginative performers. A third performer calibrates a computer system to the responses of what he calls imaginative listening."" This system adapts to the brainwave activity of the first two performers and builds a symphony ranging from quiet beginnings to climaxing crescendos. The resulting sound is simultaneously relaxing and curious. The calming flow of resonance from the brainwaves creates the illusion that time is being slowed down. In this calm, however, one cant help but wonder at the revolutionary use of brain functions as music and the potentiality of the organ inside each of our heads. The ethereal droning with occasional flaring sparks and pops evokes a timeless, spaceless experience which listeners from anywhere in the world can explore. The album continues with its experimental approach to the reverberation of space using electronics and computer algorithms in tandem with live instruments. Though only half the length of Portable Gold, compositions like The Right Measure of Opposites and Earth Encomium explore the same nothingness of space but offer grounding in the physical world through instruments like live piano. The album concludes with The Experiment and Four Lines (String Quartet). They are the only tracks to use voice and strings, respectively. These compositions call on attentive listeners to experience a constant volley between electronic and conventional instruments as they warp time and space, embellish the soundscape, and attempt to achieve a perfect synchrony.",https://youtu.be/meUFtglxDm8,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=RR8009&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Electronic,,,2019 Ravello Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All the notes and pitches are Bachs, Kraggerud says. Together with Bernt Simen Lund in the Arctic Philharmonic Chamber Orchestra he has arranged Bach`s Goldberg Variations all over again for chamber orchestra.

My native language shows itself in other ways too, as I found out early in my development as a cellist, when my teacher pointed out that I am extremely sensitive to the textures and overtones of sound, probably related to the abundance of un-voiced consonant sounds in Icelandic. It is an old language, preserved by isolation, and in the process of adapting to a quickly changing world. I see classical contemporary music sharing a similar process, finding new sounds and ways of expression through old means in a dialogue with our way of life. There is also an appreciation of silence and economy of expression in Icelandic culture that I find comforting and fascinating. This project is a compilation of pieces by composers that not only share my mother-tongue and culture, in language and music, but also bring their unique perspective and expression in their compositions. From the moment that I played Solitaire for the first time, I felt a connection, not only to the music but also beyond the music. The more recent pieces are collaborations with Halldr, Pll and urur and I couldnt have asked for more generous artists to come into my life and allow me to explore my voice through their music. This project has stretched me and challenged me in ways that I couldnt begin to comprehend, a homecoming of sorts in my musical life and I have many people to thank for making it happen. Icelandic-American cellist, Sunn Thorsteinsdttir, enjoys a varied career as a performer, collaborator and educator. She has appeared as soloist with the Los Angeles Philharmonic, NDR Elbphilharmonie Orchester, BBC Symphony Orchestra, Toronto Symphony Orchestra and Iceland Symphony, among others, and her recital and chamber music performances have taken her to many of the worlds prestigious halls including Carnegie Hall, Suntory Hall, Elbphilharmonie and the Barbican Center.

Companion pieces for this unconventional instrumental combination were hard to find, so they widened their search, bringing in Juliette Bausor (flute) and Adam Newman (viola) to the line-up, and started exploring works by other, similarly unfamiliar, composers. The result was the discovery of fantastic pieces by some other rarely-heard composers - Loeffler and by Goepfart - composers that, incidentally, hail from roughly the same part of the world as Destenay.

2019,Stradivarius,STR37096,8011570370969,Luigi Nono; Massimo Cacciari ,Nono: Prometeo Tragedia dell'ascolto,Livia Rado; Alda Caiello; Katarzyna Otczyk; Silvia Regazzo; Marco Rencinai; Sergio Basile; Manuela Mandracchia; Alvise Vidolin; Nicola Bernardini; Ensemble Prometeo; Filarmonica Arturo Toscanini; Coro del teatro Regio di Parma,2,Hybrid SACD,35.09,35.09,"Considered unanimously as one of the peaks of post-war opera, Prometeo was the acme of Nonos research, begun towards the end of the 1960s, about the sense of making music and the very aim of art, in conjunction with the reflective withdrawal of its expressive instruments and musical contents after his combative years of commitment. After a four-year elaboration work, in close cooperation with Massimo Cacciari, the opera debuted on 25th September 1984, under the baton of Claudio Abbado, in San Lorenzos deconsecrated church in Venice, where Renzo Piano had created an enormous wooden structure similar to a ship, or the soundbox of a huge lute, to accommodate the audience. Around it, at different distances from the floor and on the structure itself, the musicians moved, with very few visual effects created on purpose by Emilio Vedova. After a deep revision, the opera was staged in a definitive version exactly a year later in Milan. Prometeo is a work that refuses to relate, to represent, to compromise the listening with scenography precisely because it was born with a will to explore and stimulate a deeper ability of listening, that was supposed to be, actually, an invitation not to accept any preconceived reality. The libretto itself does not aim simply to narrate the story of Prometheus, but to evoke it through a dense net of quotations in three languages within autonomous segments that refer back to ancient theatre and quantified, roaming perception (Prologue, interludes, stasima, islands). On this basis, Nono set up a score of unprecedented, off-putting, movable and encircling sounds, often bordering on silence, manipulated by live electronics, so as to make the space tangible by eliminating the direct and conventional relationship with the drama, crushed between reciting voices, choir and solo singers, whose texts are never pronounced or sung in a conventional way. It is therefore a drama of sounds, neither of actors nor of characters: the tragedy of listening should be understood as the ability to seize what happens in a unique, unrepeatable moment, which exhorts us each time to overcome our limited knowledge without taking anything for granted.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=STR37096&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Opera,Italy,Milano Dischi,Milano Dischi,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One might view Agostino Di Scipios work as belonging to such creative musical framework. It shows a remarkable maturity in compositional conception, characterized since the beginning by two peculiar traits: a definite sonic imagination  just as harsh as much captivating  and a special interest for different sorts of systems, that Di Scipio embeds in his works as instances of reality (historical and present) in an interplay of interactions of both experiential and conceptual nature. The piano, seen as a complex cluster of cultural references  with its complicated mechanics, with playing techniques of both traditional and experimental origins, with the grandeur of its repertoire born across the centuries and still practiced today  is an overloaded token of historical reality for todays composers, keen or not to take over its implications. The five works collected here (representing Di Scipios entire piano oeuvre, as of today) seem to reflect various manners of conceptualizing and re-shaping the piano, by situating it in a hyper-system of live electronics means. Underlying is a strategy of feedback, a web of interactions among different components of non-linear and adaptive nature  a web that ideally extends itself to potentially also include innumerable other systems in its instantaneous and unforeseeable feedback dynamics, and thus open to an ecological aesthetics.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=STR37100&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Contemporary Era,Italy,Milano Dischi,Milano Dischi,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was the result of a publishing policy that was in full swing at that time and that was addressed to a large public of amateurs, a public keen to learn the repertoires meant to be played by many instruments, like opera scores. These pieces were played at home, in front of a very small and selected audience, the amateurs often wanted to perform operas that they had attended to. But that is not all, these performances were also able to popularize compositions that would have be left unknown otherwise. In the XIX century, the transcriptions for piano, especially for piano four hands, were an important vehicle for the diffusion of musical knowledge. Purposely thought for this formation, in this album the piano duo by the spouses Fabrizio Datteri and Nadia Lencioni is performing compositions inspired by the famous works and the immortal melodies of Giacomo Puccini.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=TC850005&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Solo Instrumental,Austria,2019 Tactus Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Within this album we see various composers through the twentieth century challenging with the clarinet: from William Overton Smith, winner of the Grand Prix de Rome in 1957, to the young Roman Alessandra Ravera, through figures by the great personality such as Giacinto Scelsi, or masters who left their mark like Bruno Bettinelli, or specialists of the clarinet technique like Antonio Fraioli and Giovanni Mattaliano.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=TC930002&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Solo Instrumental,Austria,2019 Tactus Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

So, it seemed therefore logical in the conception of this album, to counterpoint the poetry of a new Middle Ages (U. Eco) obbligato music by Biagio Putignano, with excerpts from the earliest surviving Italian keyboard music collection, the 1420 Faenza Codex: secular intabulations of great ingenuity, which on the threshold of the modern era are enticed to silent, comfortable joy. For the performance of these pieces, Peretti uses a positive organ from the Neapolitan School of the eighteenth century belonging to St. Ursula Kirche in Vienna.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=TC961602&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Solo Instrumental,Austria,2019 Tactus Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Noble achieved an honorable title reserved for few: that of total musician; because along with being a pedagogue, choir director and organist, he was a prolific composer during his long lifetime, as well as one of the few Mexican musicians who, following the gap opened and worked by his predecessors and contemporaries Miguel Bernal Jimenez, Arnulfo Miramontes, Jesus Estrada, Hermilio Hernandez, and Paulino Paredes, reached a total dominion of the most complex musical instrument created by mankind. The fact that two decades away from his death his musical recordings are meager, triggered Victor Manuel Morales to take on the task of paying this acquired debt. This way the talented and perfectionist interpreter obtained, with the utmost care and help from his assistant, an admirable sound record, clean of external noises",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=JBCC296&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Modern Era,Mexico,Victor Manuel Morales,URTEXT digital classics / UDCmedia SA de CV,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The group writes: Asi 3 de un fandango is the result of a long process of investigation that involved a deep contact with the Son Jarocho tradition and the desire to spread its value mainly in the public space. In 2009, the group Arcadio Hidalgo created the Son Jarocho-Orchestra project Siquisiri con cuento, with music composed by Jesus Manuel Serna, commissioned by the Orchestra of the National Conservatory of Muic, where it was already trying to show diversity, wealth, and the magico-spiritual character of the sensitivity and thought embodied in the musical tradition. In the same year the Arcadio Hidalgo group won the Traditional Musicians scholarship that the FONCA organizes, for the creation of the music associated with a play based on a story written by them. The plays aim is to show children the fabric of Son Jarocho and its cultural roots. This encounter also happened with the thought of Son as a great vessel for the message. This allowed us to create a story that speaks of a simple life process in which the cultural being finds itself in the presence of others. Tradition is like this- an intangible treasure in which each one of its heirs is giving part of himself, and building a collective knowledge.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=UL3060&medium=phy,11 Latin,Latin,Latin|Raices,Mexico,Gabriel Rojas,Urtext digital classics / UDCmedia,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
