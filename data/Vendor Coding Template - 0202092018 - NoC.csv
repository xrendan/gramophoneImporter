The title was taken from ETA Hoffmann. Johannes Kreisler was one of the author’s most enduring creations- a wild and gifted Kappelmeister. Schumann had already noted in his diary in 1832 that reading Hoffmann had opened up “new worlds” to him and, as the eight fantasies of Kreisleriana took shape between May and September 1838, the full extent of this influence became clear. Rounding out this album is Schubert’s B-Flat Major Sonata D 960, the composer’s final work for piano written during the final months of his life. Knowing as we do how acutely aware Schubert was by this time of his own approaching death, the work has an almost unbelievable spaciousness and grandeur. The four movements unfold in an unhurried and lyrical manner, and by no means tend at the exclusion of all else to gloominess. Richard Ormrod is an acclaimed soloist.

People are fortunately still singing in many different contexts and venues: in nurseries, schools, choirs, in the shower, and in television contests. What comes more naturally to a human being than singing songs? Perhaps we should avoid terms such as “Lied” and “art song.” They might sound too artificial.

Clara Schumann too composed Romances (op. 22), originally for violin and piano, but which lend themselves equally well to the oboe. And there is a wonderful arrangement by Theodor Kirchner of Robert Schumann’s Studies for the Pedal Piano op. 56, which brings together the oboe, cello and piano. In fact, it was not Träumerei, which came so strongly in the twentieth century to embody the image of Schumann’s character and oeuvre, but Abendlied op. 85 (no. 12) that was by far the best known of Robert Schumann’s works in the nineteenth century. It is therefore hardly surprising that Celine Moinet chose both works for her album, thereby eliciting new nuances from Schumann’s two “hits” with her instrument. Ultimately, it is Schumann’s Lieder and lyric gems that are lent a completely unique new coloring thanks to the oboe’s timbre. And even though there are no lyrics to this version for oboe and piano – the poetry comes out fully in any case – this is clearly a declaration of love set to music.",https://youtu.be/v_IqJcGUOB4,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=0300991BC,Classical,,Germany,2017 Edel Germany GmbH,2017 Edel Germany GmbH,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bach: Brandenburg Concertos,Concerto Koln,2,Vinyl,BC,Berlin Classics, 19.49 , 29.99 ,CN30,"For more than 30 years, Concerto Koln has stood for high standard historically informed performance. The German ECHO Classic and Record Critics' Award winning ensemble impresses with its lively precision and rousing enthusiasm and plays in the most established concert halls around the globe. The Brandenburg Concertos are a pinnacle of baroque instrumental music. Like no other Bach has juggled with the compositional possibilities of the courtly instrument in his Six Concerts avec plusieurs instruments and almost exhausted the genre encyclopedically. The collection, which was dedicated to Margrave Christian Ludwig von Brandenburg in 1721, served as a musical visiting card for the composer, which excellently outlines the genre ""Concerto with several solo instruments"". Concerto Koln not only lives up to the virtuoso playing demands on this recording, but rather makes the work shine in new splendor. For this, the ensemble re-measured renowned terrain and answered basic questions anew: how should the continuo group be occupied in the various concerts, which trumpet is played in the second Brandenburg, what about the ""Fiauti d'Echo"", Bach demanded in the fourth concert? To answer the last question, a double flute was developed according to old drawings, which produces this wished echo effect. This makes Concerto Koln the first orchestra to use such echo sounding in the fourth concert. The outstanding recording of the Brandenburg Concertos with the Concerto Koln can now and for the first time be experienced on a 180g double vinyl.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=0300997BC,Classical,,Germany,2017 Edel Germany GmbH,2017 Edel Germany GmbH,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Uniquely, oboe is the central instrument in each composition. Herlehy not only meets the demands of such a challenge but exceeds them. “Choro Negro” is a prime example. To the ear it should register as Brazilian, or even French, but it becomes something altogether different. The result, while experimental, is quite sensible leading the listener to wonder why he or she hasn’t heard the oboe in this capacity before. “Cafe 1930” is Herlehy’s opportunity to showcase her versatility with incredible depth in this introspective and solemn romanze. The other end of the spectrum is the fun and vibrant “Diabinho Maluco,” a flute and oboe duet reminiscent of the woodwind agility demonstrated in J.S. Bach’s great instrumental suites but delivered with the swagger of a modern Latin dance. On eight of the nine tracks appears guitarist David Newsam a regional powerhouse in the latin, jazz, and classical guitar community and a colleague of Herlehy at the University of New Hampshire.

Utterly fearless in his approach to these complex works, Herresthal has received recognition for his recordings, earning a Spellemannprisen (the ‘Norwegian Grammy’) as well as being shortlisted for a Gramophone Award. The present, amply-filled addition to Herresthal’s ‘string’ features the composers Rolf Wallin (b. 1957) and Eivind Buene (b. 1973). Wallin – one of Scandinavia’s leading composers – has for Herresthal made a version of Under City Skin, his 2009 concerto for viola and ensemble. The work is a poetic and sonic journey through an imaginary cityscape, with the solo violin and the string orchestra playing off and with a pre-recorded soundtrack. Buene’s Violin Concerto was also conceived with Herresthal in mind. With suggestive individual titles – Falling Angels, Sound Asleep and Among Voices – its three movements are each scored for a different combination of chamber orchestral forces.

After the success of Dejanice (1883), Catalani started to look for a new libretto. Unable to convince Boito, attracted into Verdi’s orbit, he made do with Antonio Ghislanzoni, who had been resting for at least fifteen years on the laurels from the triumph of Aida. The poet gave the maestro the ready-made libretto of Edmea, which had bene written already for Salvatore Auteri Mazocchi and not set to the music. The libretto, drawn from a drama by Alexandre Dumas Jr., The Danicheff, is an unlikely story conceived in function of a prima donna in a state of lunacy, according to an operatic tradition revived in those years by Thomas heroine of Ophelia in Hamlet. Edmea is undoubtedly an attempt of the musician to please his audience with a relatively easy listening product, with emphasizing the vocal score, pushing it toward the extreme notes; in particular the tenor’s part is not only sharp but also kept more than due in the theatrical zone of the register passage. The main interest of the opera is in the orchestra, often splendidly used with very subtle sensibility for aims that exceed by far a mere elaborated support to singing. The orchestra language is always careful, present, alive and consistent, elegant and varied with languors and succen excitements.

Echoes of this ancient psalmody can be heard in the profoundly religious feeling of his arias, almost as though Rossi were attempting to keep his distance from a trend - already present in the late 1500s due to social, cultural and aesthetic factors – towards using sacred cantatas as an exercise in baroque vocal extravagance to showcase the skill of the performer rather than inspire religious feeling in the listener.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=GB5638-2,Classical,,Italy,2017 Bongiovanni,2017 Bongiovanni,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bells have a special importance for every Russian: their cathedrals are distinctive for the sound of pealing bells. Hearing them also left a lasting impression on Rachmaninov. The four stanzas of the poem vividly present the sounds of sleigh-bells, wedding bells, alarm bells and funeral bells, and these very different moods are masterfully conveyed in the four movements of the most monumental symphonic poem Rachmaninov ever wrote. The ""Symphonic Dances"" for large orchestra were written in 1940 on Long Island. The first movement contains a quotation from Rachmaninov's (unsuccessful) First Symphony; the second deals with the years between the turn of the century and the Russian Revolution; and the third connects the ""Dies Irae"" (representing death) with the ""Hallelujah"" of the Orthodox Liturgy (symbolising the Resurrection).

The first Elegiac Trio was conceived and written down in only four days, between the 18th and 21st of Jaunuary 1892, the first performance taking place on January 30th. The work remained unpublished until 1947. Rachmaninoff’s tormented, almost morbid disposition is deeply sounded at the very beginning of the first section lento lugubre. A mysterious background of murmuring strings preambles the lyrical flight of the piano’s first theme, followed by a variety of other episodes rich and full of melodic plenitude, pathos and passion, writing already representative of the mature Rachmaninoff to come. The second Elegiac Trio was inspired by the sudden death of Tchaikovsky in October 1893. Pianist Alan J. Ball hails from Utah.

Anchoring the album is the Grammy Award-winning ensemble’s original new collaborative composition Paddle to the Sea. The fearsomely talented foursome conceived it as a live soundtrack to the charming, Oscar-nominated 1966 film of the same name, based on a classic children’s story about a Native Canadian boy who carves a wooden figure called Paddle-to-the-Sea and launches him on a solo canoe voyage to the ocean. The Dallas Morning News called Third Coast’s concert performance “arresting and enjoyable.” TheaterJones called it “unforgettable” and said, “There was something magical about the performance, but it is almost impossible to describe the experience in mere words.” In composing Paddle to the Sea, Third Coast found a wellspring of ideas in the other works they’ve included on the album. Jacob Druckman’s Reflections on the Nature of Water revels in textures and timbres unique to the marimba as it explores the different characters water can embody. Third Coast plays its own arrangement of selections from Philip Glass’s 12 Pieces for Ballet (originally composed for piano) — also drawing inspiration from Brazilian group Uakti’s multi-instrumental version, titled Aguas da Amazonia.

The text was chosen because of its beautiful use of the English language, its musical flow and character, and particularly for its rather ambiguous and thought provoking exploration of human loss. The Raven's entire eighteen stanzas are used, and Wagner's leitmotif technique links important aspects of the poem with musical gestures and the repeated 'nevermore'. A sad and nostalgic little waltz occurs in the first stanza as our hero remembers and then tries to forget his 'lost Lenore'. Fragments of this theme recur, alternately haunting and then sarcastically taunting him as he navigates the emotional twists and turns of the poem. A heartbeat motive is used throughout, sometimes deep in the texture, sometimes front and center, much as our own heartbeats reflect states of calm or excitement and instability. Poe introduces the bird with a bit of humor, and this is reflected in the music as the subject's emotions change from curiosity to sarcasm then madness and finally resignation as he interacts with this (imaginary?) visitor. The musical language of The Raven is challenging for both the chorus and orchestra: chromaticism, quickly changing meter and tempo, irregular rhythm, very dense angular writing, and Neo Romantic/Impressionist textures.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=CSCD-002,Classical,,United States,2015 Colorado Symphony Association,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Composed in Venice, probably in 1715, for the choir of the Ospedale della Pietà, its wonderfully sunny nature and distinctive melodies and rhythms give it an immediate and universal appeal. Bach was a fierce admirer of Vivaldi’s work, and his extraordinarily inventive Mass in G major complements the Gloria perfectly.

This dimension was connected to the influence of theosophy, which began around 1913 and would lead to some works of speculative stamp. Helena Petrovna Blavatsky and others had established the Theosophical Society in New York in 1875. One of her pupils, the English author Annie Besant, served as the society’s president beginning in 1907 and established the Order of the Star of the East in 1910. When the Danish section first met, Louis Glass played the organ. It was around this time that Glass began his work on the Fantasia for Piano and Orchestra, as this work is the first that reflects the composer’s relation to theosophy- which is shown above all in the work’s introspective motto alluding to theosophy: “From the spirit’s eternal canopy tones calling man sound down. And man turns away from the world and remains alone in order to find peace.”",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=777494-2,Classical,,Germany,2017 cpo,2017 cpo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Eos Guitar Quartet often performs works by Leo Brouwer and Ralph Townwe and has commissioned these artists to compose original music for the quartet. Everyone knows and appreciates each other. And as a highly specialized chamber music ensemble, the Eos Guitar Quartet naturally tries to help expand the repertoire for such a formation. This Performance of Gismontiana is a live recording of a concert featuring the Eos Guitar Quartet together with the Musikkollegium Winterthur conducted by composer Leo Brower.

Three of today’s brightest Swedish composers feature on the album from Uppsala Vocal Ensemble under its galvanizing conductor since 2011, Sofia Agren.  All three new works on UrVerk are the fruits of a new kind of experimentation. In creating his 2013 piece for choir and saxophone Ungefär fyra improvisationer, composer Emil Raberg participated in extensive workshops with the Uppsala Vocal Ensemble in order to tease-out a viable expression and equilibrium between the instrument and the singers. The result is a fascinating and febrile mix of written and improvised music in four movements.  In creating her new work Andas den ut ur mitt brost, composer Maria Lithell Flyg explored the idea of singing as physical release from the bodily and emotional inhibitions of everyday life. The resulting music breaks and ‘breathes out’ from its opening rumblings with distinctively human joy.  Martin Q Larsson’s Hundra tusen miljarder uses Raymond Queneau’s ‘interactive poetry’ of the same title to create a vocal collage of music and thought – poetry and conversation – that can never be the same twice.

It is a virile yet melancholy statement of belief in the power of the collective human voice, with no recourse to words, which is full of Jennefelt’s trademark clarity and his alluring combination of musical intimacy and sweep. This meticulous performance was made by another choir founded by Ericson, the Swedish Radio Choir, which is joined by its sister symphony orchestra under one of the most sought-after conductors of our time, Andrew Manze.  Some of the sensuality that finds its way into Nocturnal Singing is heard in the more obviously theatrical Four Opera Choruses, written in 2016 for ‘as yet unwritten operas.’ We hear yet more strong contrasts and clear narratives, but always music that is born of the voice despite its complexity and theoretical rigor.

This work full of distinctive Romanian inflections is one of the unsung gems of the violin sonata repertory, and is presented on this new recording just as Europe’s major orchestras and opera houses are reappraising Enescu’s extraordinary sound-world and legacy. Carl Nielsen’s Violin Sonata No 2 gives voice to the Danish composer’s compelling harboring of musical energy, flux and confrontation, but with a long-breathed lyricism that is often absent from the composer’s best known symphonic works. Completing the programme is Olivier Messiaen’s Fantasie and Thème et Variations – music which draws us closely into the French composer’s unique, searchingly lyrical sound world. ‘Both subtle and brilliant’, writes The Strad of Stanculeasa’s playing.

Today, of course, few objections are raised in hearing performances of Bach’s harpsichord and clavichord music played on a modern concert grand piano, as well as transcriptions of his organ works, such transcriptions being almost always accepted as repertoire pieces.

David M. Patrick is one of the most brilliant British organists of this time. He pursued his musical education at the Royal College of Music with distinction winning the Stuart Prize the following year. This award brought him prestigious recitals at both Westminster Abbey and Westminster Cathedral as well as the honor of being presented to HRH Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother. When the Coventry Cathedral was reduced to ruins in an air raid in November 1940, the fine ‘Father’ Willis organ of 1886 was totally destroyed. The building of the new Cathedral presented the opportunity for a brand new organ to match it. Messrs Harrison & Harrison were appointed in 1952 and a provisional specification was drawn up. The organ was overhauled and upgraded to include solid-state technology in 1986/87.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=GMCD7801,Classical,,United Kingdom,2017 Guild Music Limited,2017 Guild Music Limited,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mystic magus, heretic priest, hermetic philosopher, spy and playwright, Giordano Bruno was one of the renaissance’s most brilliant and controversial men. Burned at the stake in 1600- after a nine-year trial by the Roman inquisition- Bruno envisioned a cosmos without a center, in nite galaxies and inhabited planets. His writings predated quantum theory by 350 years and his play Il Candelaio influenced numerous works by Shakespeare and Moliere. Giordano Bruno is the ideal subject for opera. A cultural superstar in his own time, his importance and relevance has continued to grow over the centuries. Heresy is written for 5 high voices including star male soprano Robert Crowe and 14 year old wunderkid, Aimee Banks. Heresy begins with Bruno teaching his system of magic memory to Henry III of France and includes scenes with his literary inventions and feminine ideals, Circe and Sophia. Further scenes focus on episodes at the court of Queen Elizabeth I, his trial before the Inquisition- presided over by his nemesis, Cardinal Robert Bellarmine- an hallucinatory scene in his cell the night before he is burned at the stake where he is visited by himself as a young boy, Circe and Sophia and James Joyce (a lifelong admirer of Bruno’s), his death by fire and his apotheosis among the cosmos.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=HERESY%20021,Classical,,Irish Republic,2017 Heresy Records,2017 Heresy Reocrds,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Good evidence of this claim is the program brought together here by Angel Soria. Six recent pieces within a time period of two decades (the oldest one goes back to the year 2000), written by composers of different aesthetics (despite all of them belonging to what it is generally called the avant-garde), define the plurality of the aesthetic and expressive options offered by the saxophone.

Through his friendship with Liszt, Franck was encouraged to study the music of Beethoven, Bach and Wagner- three composers who each clearly left their mark on his compositions. It was especially after 1859 that Franck found his distinct voice: the new Cavaille-Coll organ, which had just been installed in the basilica of Saint Clotilde, was an important source of inspiration for the recently appointed “titulaire.” The first decades of the 19th century saw a decline for the organ in France. The abundant repertoire of 18th century French organ music had all but sunk into oblivion. What one heard for the most part was improvisation, often based on music that was popular at the time, opera in particular, and, above all, Rossini. When French music began to turn away from its hitherto one-sided focus on opera and towards chamber music and symphonic works of the 1870s, Franck was a central source of inspiration.

Nikolai Kapustin has a special place in the world of contemporary academic music. He has managed to achieve a harmonious synthesis of classical traditions and jazz. The art of jazz is not an expressive means but the essence of the musical language spoken by the composer. At the same time, his works are written in the conventional classical and baroque forms. Kapustin’s Cello Concerto No. 2 (2002) was written for an orchestra’s chamber string line-up. Here, the timbre of the strings replaces both the percussions and brass winds of a jazz band, and the voice of the solo cello combines the improvisational aspect of the jazz instruments with a pronounced concerto virtuosic element.

Now, this new reissue is something to get excited about. Frank studied with Artur Schnabel for a decade, and one can clearly hear his mentor’s influence in this recording- the analytical awareness, structural planning, and attention to detail are hard to miss. Jed Distler writes in Gramophone: “Frank… shares his teachers’ concern with both the music’s architecture and passion, yet brings his own brand of stylish exuberance to the mix. The early sonatas particularly rock with rhythmic brio, zesty accentuation, and characterful wit. Interestingly, they contrast to Frank’s genial, slightly sedate reading of the Op. 31 group. As the cycle progresses chronologically, Frank’s intelligent flexibility asserts itself with telling results. In addition to his superb, exultant Appasionata, Les Adieux, and last three sonatas, Frank finds more melodic appeal than usual beneath Op. 101 and 106’s gnarly bushes. In short, this is one of the more stimulating Beethoven sonata cycles around…”",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=MA%20CD-4640,Classical,,Germany,2002,2002,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition to two traditional suites, the present programme offers two ensembles of pieces either chosen from certain suites or free-standing – including the mournful allemande in G minor – all taken from manuscripts of lute pieces preserved in Vienna or Prague. Evangelina Mascardi is considered one of the most prominent lute players on the international scene for her impressive interpretation, her brilliant virtuosity and admirable sound texture palette. In 1997 she moved to Europe to study with Hopkinson Smith at the Schola Cantorum Basiliensis (Basel, Switzerland), where she obtained her “Solisten Diplom” in 2001. During the last decade she collaborated regularly as a continuo-player with Jordi Savall (Hespèrion XXI), Marc Minkowsky (Les Musiciens du Louvre), Andrea Marcon (Venice Baroque Orchestra), Chiara Banchini (415), Simon Rattle (Berliner Philarmoniker).

Based around the pitch of “C,” each short short establishes its own character and technical approach while sharing the common thread of its pitch. The compositions ring with recurring themes in melody and rhythmic texture, coming together at the final “Short Short No. 9” which unveils a grand finale.

A. Kawarsky. PRISMA spans the spectrum of unique styles of composition, from the grandiose and triumphant to the fragile and tender. This compilation captures a journey through colorful orchestral elements in a singular listening experience that builds into a thrilling sound. PRISMA opens with triumph in Sainsbury’s “Time of the Comet.” Written in 1997, the piece was inspired by the visual presence of the Hale-Bopp comet. Sainsbury translated his vision into a grand composition featuring a proud and virtuous introduction that transitions between allegro and slow sections concluding with prevailing optimism and possibility. Muncaster’s “Reflective Thought Patterns” builds in arch form to its central section and then literally reflects itself in reverse order. The composition starts with brass and timpani, transitioning its melody patterns on woodwinds, marimba, vibraphone, and French horn until the piece comes together at the end echoing the opening this time with a full orchestra. “Among the Hidden” by Patricia Julien, introduces an eerie, darker shade to the PRISMA collection. Building off a circular, three-note piano melody, the moodiness of the composition creates a stark, yet refreshing contrast to the bright, brave orchestral performance of the other composers. Lastly, Kawarsky’s “Fastidious Notes” draws in the ear of the listener with its unusual 5/4 metrical setting. The composition, based on a reworking of the American folk-song “Goodbye Old Paint,” features a sound borrowed right from the school of 20th century American classical music.

The Baroness captures the eye of young Clifford Wentworth, and his girlfriend’s older brother Robert; meanwhile, Felix falls for his American cousin Gertrude. The Wentworths are overawed by their European cousins and their frivolous lifestyle. What unfolds is a delightful comedy of manners that contrasts the apparently sophisticated and light-hearted Europeans with the serious and puritanical Americans.

The centerpiece of the program is the title work itself, a three movement piece that includes movements that can be heard either in solo versions, as they open and close the recording, or in ensemble settings, as they are heard in tracks 4-6. The genesis for the material in Three Burials comes from an interesting transcription process from Peruvian indigenous flute material to the modern flute. Pablo asked Dalia to transcribe this material in a natural and non-literal way to the moder flute, and then this material was subjected to further manipulation and distortion, resulting in the multiphonics laden material that can be heard in the opening solo flute track. In the ensemble setting of Three Burials, the insistent, almost desperate quality of the quasi vertical flute sonorities manifests itself in prismatic textures tspread through the ensemble, as guitar and piano punctuate the texture with percussive snaps, plucks, and creaks, and cello and double bass offer sighing glissandi and grinding dissonances.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=FCR195,Classical,,,2017 Pablo Santiago Chin,2017 Pablo Santiago Chin,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tuur describes his viola concerto Illuminatio (2008) is “a pilgrimage towards eternal light”. The work opens with a mysterious soundscape. As the work progresses, the music develops and grows, and the relationships between the soloist and the orchestra is in a constant change. Whistles and Whispers from Uluru (2007) for recorder and chamber orchestra was written to a commission from the Australian Chamber Orchestra for recorder virtuoso Genevieve Lacey. When the composer was writing the work at his summer residence in the island of Hiiumaa in Estonia, it was spring and the air was full of birdsong. In his mind, he connected Uluru, the sacred mountain of the Australian Aborigines, to his northern surroundings, and the two impulses fused. The soloist goes through multiple members of the recorder family, from sopranino down through treble, alto and tenor to bass, and then back to the heights of the sopranino. An electronic soundtrack augments the texture at times. Symphony No. 8 was commissioned by the Scottish Chamber Orchestra and was completed in 2010. Tuur scored the work for a sinfonietta-type ensemble instead of a large symphony orchestra, and as a result the music has at times a chamber music feel.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=ODE%201303-2,Classical,,Finland,"2018 Ondine Oy, Helsinki","2018 Ondine Oy, Helsinki",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This new album by cellist Tanja Tetzlaff and pianist Gunilla Sussmann includes Rautavaara’s rarely heard works written for cello and piano. The cornerstone of Rautavaara’s cello chamber music are the three sonatas. The earliest of the sonatas was written in 1969 and contains Baroque influences. Prior to this, the composer had already written Two Preludes and Fugues for cello and piano in 1955 firmly rooted in the Neo-Classical tradition as a young student. Soon after completing his solo cello sonata, the composer started writing his Neo-Romantic Sonata for Cello and Piano No. 1. However, the work was left unfinished and completed almost 30 years later, in 2001. Cello Sonata No. 2, completed in 1991, is much different in style, more modern and edgy, but based on a work written for a cello music competition in 1975. Polska (1977) for two cellos and piano is based on a folk tune from Rantasalmi. The origin of this work is connected to the genesis of Rautavaara’s first published opus, Fiddlers (Pelimannit) from the early 1950s. Song of My Heart (Sydämeni laulu) is the composer’s transcription from an aria included in his opera Aleksis Kivi (1995–96). In 2000, Rautavaara arranged the piece for cello, and fittingly for this funereal piece dedicated it to the memory of Estonian composer Lepo Sumera.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=ODE%201310-2,Classical,,Finland,"2018 Ondine Oy, Helsinki","2018 Ondine Oy, Helsinki",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

James Weldon Johnson wanted to portray the “old-time preacher” from the early 19th century that was rapidly disappearing by the 1920’s.

Beethoven’s ninth is one of the best symphonies ever written, an autonomous work of art that transcends borders and sets new standards, which in its humanitarian thinking and belief in the progressive development of mankind towards freedom, powerfully appeals to the human heart. Kubelik’s reading of the ninth brings together “sweeping grandeur, volatile energy and radiant emotion” with “crisp orchestral playing and fine articulation”. His “deeply felt rendition” fully lives up to the “human aspiration and cosmic majesty” of this exceptional work (allmusic.com).

This is the second release in a series of recordings in multi-channel surround sound for Pentatone by the conductor Andrew Manze and the NDR Radiophilharmonie. It’s no wonder that Robert Schumann dubbed Mendelssohn the “Mozart of the nineteenth century”; with his felicitous gift for melody and meticulous craftsmanship, his music positively brims with youthful spontaneity and exuberance, blending dreamy poetic flights with moments of affecting tenderness and serenity. All this comes together in his Italian symphony, that is so full of joie de vivre, so sparkling with energy and esprit, so full of Mediterranean gaiety. Far beyond the picturesque, the piece offers Mendelssohn’s profoundly personal reflection, transformed into music, on the impressions made on his senses by the landscape, architecture, lifestyle, and people of Italy. Equally personal is Mendelssohn’s Reformation symphony, in which the devoutly Christian composer aimed to combine elements and traditions of sacred instrumental music with those of an autonomous symphony. The result is highly original: a so-called finale symphony, in which the programmatic destination of the entire work is oriented towards the finale, based on the Lutheran chorale “A mighty fortress is our God”.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=PTC5186611,Classical,,Germany,2016-2017 Norddeutscher Rundfunk,2018 Pentatone,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The historical opera Le carilloneur de Bruges is an outlier in the operatic production of Albert Grisar, who was quite successful in Paris around the middle of the 19th century, especially as a composer of opera bouffe. The subject may have been Flemish, but the libretto was by Jules-Henry Vernoy de Saint-Georges, a French author who dominated theatrical life in Paris in the 1830s, together with Eugene Scribe. The plot of Le carillonneur de Bruges, a three-acter, takes place in Bruges in 1566, during the Spanish rule of the Low Countries. The principal part is that of the old carilloneur Matheus Claes and his bells. Both Grisar and his librettist appeal to Flemish nationalism as well as Belgian patriotism. The opera ends in an anachronistic tribute to the Flemish flag, and is dedicated to Leopold I, King of the Belgians. It was premiered on February 10, 1852, in the Paris Opera-Comique, and no expense was spared. Like Beethoven did in his Egmont overture, Grisar’s overture outlines the plot, starting with a slow, ominous introduction and ending in an enthusiastic transformation of what would have been a tragedy into a triumphant finale, with the tribute to the Flemish flag. Grisar reveals his gift for striking melodies and uses “Rossini crescendos” effectively.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=PH%2092096,Classical,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The number “three” had a special meaning for Bach and was the basis for the triple concertos, the concertos for three solo instruments, recorded here. On the one hand, the number three had for Bach a Christian connotation; on the other hand, there were also entirely profane reasons. As an essential element of late-baroque texture, the “three” was reflected in the trio sonata, whose structure was the basis of numerous instrumental and vocal pieces. Bach probably composed the Concerto for three harpsichords especially for two of his sons (and pupils), taking the third part himself. In the Third Brandenburg Concerto, the idea of three solo instruments is carried even further in that each of the three string groups – violins, violas, and violoncellos – have three independent parts. Harmony of Nations was founded in 2004 by twenty young musicians from fourteen different nations, hence the orchestra’s name. Since then it has collaborated with numerous well-known musical personalities from the early music scene, including Lars Ulrik Mortensen, Ton Koopman, Andrew Manze, Alfredo Bernardini, Konrad Junghänel, and, as on this recording, Laurence Cummings.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=RK3007,Classical,,Germany,2010,2017,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Morris recorded the album live at a “Summer at Eastman Concert” in Hatch Recital Hall, in Rochester, NY. Consisting of only two tracks, “Mountain Streams” and “Mysterious Landscape,” these dramatic compositions turn ordinary sounds of nature in extraordinary pursuits of sonic ambience. Like a drop in a pond, both tracks start small and simple only to evolve into an all-encompassing, full sound that excites curiosity while evoking relaxation. The first track “Mountain Streams” consists entirely of sounds from streams, creeks, brooks, and other bodies of moving water. In the beginning, the composition starts with a reading from a Zen Koan, as the sounds of flowing water move in real time. As the composition progresses, the evolution of sound grows, building the tension to a heart-racing climax until a splash disrupts the flow, breaking the percolating trance. “Mysterious Landscape,” at a run time of about 30 minutes, is an improvisational electro-acoustic piece. Performed entirely on Morris’s laptop, the composition consists of four tracks twisting and blending into each other to create a serene soundscape. The natural noise of birds, frogs, insects, mammals, wind, and water play off the acoustics of the Hatch Recital Hall, sending the sonic waves oscillating throughout the room.

Cela furthers the investigation with “Winter Variations,” by Lou Bunk (“featuring John Cage”), investigating, too, the possible extremes in lower dynamics. In Robert Gross’ “Variations on a Schenker Graph of Gesualdo,” Cela challenges the listener to decipher what is real from what is imagined.

This desire to reassess the popular tradition and culture of the artist’s nation went hand in hand with legitimate aspirations of liberation from the centralized powers in order to create independent states. Few composers have been more identified with this historical process than Chopin. The fate of his country was always at the center of his thoughts and the musical form of the land from which he drew his inspiration were more to him than simple artistic value.

The desire of recording it came later to him, much later, toward 2009, but it was still too early to record. This wonderful sonata has never left his mind and has had a home in his piano, and will remain there until the end. His decision to record the Schubert fantasy for 4 hands was an immediate choice on his part. Like the Sonata D960 it is an absolute masterpiece.

On the occasion of Carsten Dahl's 50th birthday in October, we also release a new live show as an album, taken from a sublime concert in Tobaksgaarden in Assens on 18th of September 2016.

The Debussy works and the encores have never been previously released. The performance is musically outstanding and features engaging repertoire, thus being an impressive record of a legendary musician. The eminent Romanian pianist, Clara Haskil began, her career as a child prodigy and entered at the Bucharest Conservatory when she was 6. At age 7 she was sent to Vienna and profited from the tutelage pf Richard Robert (whose memorable pupils included Rudolf Serkin and George Szell) and briefly with Ferruccio Busoni. She was only 7 (or 10) when she made her public debut there. At 10 she was sent to Paris to continue her training with Morpain, and, at 12, entered the Paris Conservatoire. A celebrated interpreter of classical and early romantic repertoire, many considered Clara the foremost interpreter of W. A. Mozart in her time. She was also widely known for her interpretation of Beethoven and Schumann, both of which can be heard on this recital.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=SWR19052CD,Classical,,Germany,1953 SWR Media Services GmbH,2018 Naxos Deutschland GmbH,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The prominent standing of the conductor Karel Ancerl is due mainly to his success in establishing the Czech Philharmonic as one of the world’s most eminent and successful orchestras in only a few years’ time. Under his great predecessor Vaclav Talich, the most significant Czech conductor of the twentieth century, the orchestra was able to flourish primarily in its home country, yet under Ancerl it became, despite the restrictions of the Cold War, an orchestra that was celebrated everywhere, whose 1959 world tour went down in history as the longest and most extensive ever up to that time.

It consists of four musical programmes, prepared in great detail, and employing the newest musicological, philological, historical and organological research. Each of these programmes presents the local character of a different coastal region of Balticum, its specific historical and cultural situation, its most important saints and rulers, and the Christian roots of the relevant country. They provide an insight into the local literature and musical repertories of medieval Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Germany, and Poland; both Latin and the vernacular are represented, as well as the diversity of historical musical instruments used in those regions at the time. The project as a whole, however, aims to show something of the strong political and cultural connections between those medieval countries, their development over time, and the similarities between them, all of which are essential to our understanding of the common identity and history of Balticum, as is reflected to us through its centuries of music.

A fine ensemble was required to take up this challenge: the Syntonia Quintet, hailed for its previous releases of Dvorak, Schumann, Franck and Olivier Greif.

He writes of this album: “The word ‘Trova’ carries different meanings- sometimes music, others poetry, from the European Middle ages to Contemporary Cuban music. For me, it evokes the capacity to express something powerful, authentic and meaningful: a cry that puts things in motion- the “Caminhada,” which literally means ‘walking’ or even better, ‘outing.’ This ‘Trova Caminhada’ departs from sinuous road, filled with memories, pain and joyful celebration. It puts in perspective my adulthood, in more than fifteen years of songwriting, as “Piano Secreto” was written in 1999 and “A Ginga da Moma” in 2016, and the remaining songs in between. Until now, I made a career as guitarist and arranger; this album is a personal landmark, in which I fully embrace the role of vocalist.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=TTK%200014,World/Int'l.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The pieces on this recording, however, were written both before and after this particular aesthetic phase. The point of departure for these ideas (as Lachenmann put it in 1970) is sound itself “as the characteristic result and signal of its mechanical origin and the more or less economical use of the energy required to produce it.” Noise-like instrumental sounds are examined for similarities and contrasts. They are also cataloged: categories and families are created as the foundation of a kind of motivic development using noises and sounds. In “Got Lost” Lachenmann used four lines from Nietzsche, the poem “All Love Letters Are Ridiculous” by Fernando Pessoa and a short note in English lamenting the loss of a laundry basket which gave this work its name. Lachenmann wrote: “Three only seemingly unrelated texts, stripped of their lofty, poetic, or mundane diction, are all presented by the same sound source – a soprano voice singing ‘any old way’ – and sent into a constantly changing intervallic field of sound, resonance, and movement.""",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=WER73672,Classical,,Austria,2018 Wergo,2018 Wergo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2018,4260313960149,WS014,Ludwig van Beethoven,Beethoven: Symphonies Nos. 4 & 5,Wiener Symphoniker; Philippe Jordan,1,CD,VSO,Wiener Symphoniker, 14.81 , 22.99 ,CN23,"For the first time in their history, the Wiener Symphoniker will release a complete Beethoven symphonies cycle. The Wiener Symphoniker wrote music history with the first performances of works by Bruckner, Ravel and Schoenberg. And under the baton of such illustrious music directors as Wilhelm Furtwängler, Herbert von Karajan, Carlo Maria Giulini or Georges Prêtre they acquired worldwide fame for their unique Viennese sound. Considering its rich, more than a century long history, it comes as a surprise that the orchestra has never before recorded a full cycle of the nine symphonies by Ludwig van Beethoven which are widely considered to constitute the apex of the symphonic repertoire. This shortcoming is about to be remedied: Starting in autumn 2017, the Wiener Symphoniker will release the full cycle on 5 albums. With a new release of the series to be issued every 6 months, the full cycle will be completed just in time for the 250th anniversary of the birth of Beethoven in 2020. The symphonies were recorded live during a critically acclaimed concert cycle in Spring/Summer 2017 in the Great Hall of the Musikverein Wien. At these concerts, the international press specifically praised Jordan’s approach to combining a traditional Viennese sound with a more contemporary, slimmed down interpretation of the material, original tempi and insights from the historically informed performance practice. Through a close reading of the score and by focusing on the content of the works, Jordan aimed to create – in his words – a “more natural, direct, humanised“ image of the famous composer.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=WS014,Classical,,Austria,2017 WIENER SYMPHONIKER,2017 WIENER SYMPHONIKER,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ron Miles ‘s lyrical and complex compositions provide the perfect framework for five masters who blur the boundaries of conventional soloing and accompanying in a constant ebb and flow marked by brilliant harmonizing and strokes of individual genius. Critics have already been shouting their praise for this release.
