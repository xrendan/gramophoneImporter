Zhang Cheng was awarded the Clara Haskil Prize (and the Audience Prize) in 2011 and the Schumann Prize in 2016, prompting him to study the complete canon of his favorite composer. About his preference for Robert Schumann and his music, Zhang Cheng says: “There was no specific moment where I decided that I should study Schumann’s complete oeuvre. The reason that keeps me exploring his music is his humanity. In my opinion, Schumann is an extraordinarily free and generous personality. Most importantly, he allows himself not to be perfect and first and foremost to be who he is. Schumann was also an endless resource of inspiration for me in my search for my own identity.” In Europe, Zhang Cheng has performed at the Klavierfestival Ruhr, the Chopin Festival in Nohant, the Verbier Festival, the September Music Festival in Montreux-Vevey, the International Music Festival in Berlin and at the Gewandhaus in Leipzig.

"". In 1909, his idyllic world was destroyed, having been diagnosed with a heart valve defect two years earlier – a disease that would ultimately lead to his death. While his last completed symphony still contains some folksy elements, Mahler composed a heartbreaking Adagio as its Finale.

Born in 1994 to a Bulgarian family of musicians – her mother is a pianist, her father and brother are violinists, her sister plays violin too and she herself learned the instrument – Vivi was captivated by music at an early age especially when she heard some hand drummers playing on a remote, unspoiled beach at the black sea where her parents own a house. It was then that she decided to change from violin to percussion. With her dynamic, infectious way of making music, Vivi exudes a sense of enjoyment that is in no way limited to the elaboration of rhythms or the igniting of a display of tonal pyrotechnics. Her main aim is to touch people, to tell stories expressed in terms of melodies, harmonies and rhythms. Vivi is motivated and inspired by the diversity of tonal colors and the opportunities they offer, and that is why she is so convinced that percussion is the instrument of the 21st century. However, since the repertoire for percussion is limited, Vivi Vassileva not only commissions new compositions; she arranges and composes herself, constantly on the lookout for new formations and heading up various chamber music groups. As a result, this new album features works by Guillo Espel, Eric Sammut, Oriol Cruixent and Keiko Abe, most of them premiere recordings, alongside some rarely heard or premiere arrangements and compositions by Vivi Vassileva herself.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=ALPHA463&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Netherlands,2019 BR-KLASSIK & ALPHA CLASSICS/OUTHERE MUSIC FRANCE,2019 ALPHA CLASSICS/OUTHERE MUSIC FRANCE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Everything about music is moving’; these are the words in which Wolfgang Rihm once stated his musical credo. His chamber opera Jakob Lenz has in the meantime become one of the most frequently performed works in the 20thcentury German opera repertoire. Based on Georg Büchner’s novella about the poet Jakob Lenz’s unavoidable decline into madness, Wolfgang Rihm builds a highly charged atmosphere that leads us compellingly to a dramatic denouement. As a result of the wealth of musical styles – ranging from spoken text through Sprechgesang and recitative to fully elaborated coloratura – and of harmonic techniques – atonality, widened tonality and pure tonality – this work is sometimes compared to Berg’s Wozzeck.

The music should sound solemn and magnificent, like an overture: majestic, like Beethoven’s Eroica. That is how Hungarian composer Gyorgy Ligeti begins Musica ricercata, one of his early works from the early 1950s. In exemplary fashion, the cycle blends minimalist structures with a sumptuous array of colors. Behind each note lurks the exigency that nothing should escape the pianist’s attention: he should be aware of all that takes place in the present, while remaining prepared for everything that can occur in the next moment. Such challenges await the performer in Ligeti as well as in Beethoven. Long before he thought of coupling the works by Beethoven and Ligeti on album, Herbert Schuch had tried out the combination in the concert hall. “I quickly get a feel whether a programme works well, or whether it’s just something I’ve conceived in my head. Of course I was aware that these cycles were never intended to be picked apart. I find it important to feel assured that I’m not undermining their essence, and that the new order also makes sense.

Telling more often than not about the pangs of love, these are intimate works, with texts frequently written by (and sometimes about) members of the privileged audience for which they were composed. A number of Handel’s cantatas have texts by one of his important Italian patrons, Cardinal Benedetto Pamphilj. The project of Marco Vitale to record all of Handel’s cantatas is thrilling.

After the premiere in 2017, both Norwegian and international critics praised director Marit Moum Aune’s dance production, set to music by Nils Petter Molvær. Hedda is furious, on the verge of being consumed with disappointment. After a six-month honeymoon in Europe she has returned home to set up home with her husband, Jørgen – but nothing has turned out the way she intended. And when her former lover Eilert Løvborg enters the picture, she reacts in a way that proves perilous for everyone – including herself. Hedda Gabler is one of world theatre’s most well-known characters – an icon created by Henrik Ibsen. Is she cowardly or brave? Spoilt or stuck? Wicked or desperate? Our greatest actors have always found new ways to interpret this psychologically complex role. Now the talented dancers of the Norwegian National Ballet provide their own interpretation, adding another dimension to the drama. While the original play is an intense chamber play in which a lot is left unsaid, Moum Aune paints with a broad brush. Hedda’s world opens up as we delve deeper into her relationships and background. We get to see major scenes that are only hinted at in Ibsen’s text. The dancers in the eight central roles have all contributed to their own choreography, with each movement crucial in the telling of this intense story. Hedda Gabler is the follow-up to Moum Aune’s first success with Ibsen as dance, in which she directed and choreographed Ibsen’s Ghosts together with Cina Espejord. Both productions are among the Norwegian National Ballet’s greatest successes, and are in high demand around the world. BONUS : Hedda Gabler, The Other Side A 52 min.

After the premiere in 2017, both Norwegian and international critics praised director Marit Moum Aune’s dance production, set to music by Nils Petter Molvær. Hedda is furious, on the verge of being consumed with disappointment. After a six-month honeymoon in Europe she has returned home to set up home with her husband, Jørgen – but nothing has turned out the way she intended. And when her former lover Eilert Løvborg enters the picture, she reacts in a way that proves perilous for everyone – including herself. Hedda Gabler is one of world theatre’s most well-known characters – an icon created by Henrik Ibsen. Is she cowardly or brave? Spoilt or stuck? Wicked or desperate? Our greatest actors have always found new ways to interpret this psychologically complex role. Now the talented dancers of the Norwegian National Ballet provide their own interpretation, adding another dimension to the drama. While the original play is an intense chamber play in which a lot is left unsaid, Moum Aune paints with a broad brush. Hedda’s world opens up as we delve deeper into her relationships and background. We get to see major scenes that are only hinted at in Ibsen’s text. The dancers in the eight central roles have all contributed to their own choreography, with each movement crucial in the telling of this intense story. Hedda Gabler is the follow-up to Moum Aune’s first success with Ibsen as dance, in which she directed and choreographed Ibsen’s Ghosts together with Cina Espejord. Both productions are among the Norwegian National Ballet’s greatest successes, and are in high demand around the world. BONUS : Hedda Gabler, The Other Side A 52 min.

The acknowledged Clara Schumann expert Ragna Schirmer has devoted a special act of homage to her artistic predecessor, taking two original concert programmes selected from Clara’s decades of concert performance and recording them to provide insight into the life and work of this very special woman. In 1847, Clara and her husband Robert Schumann gave a matinee concert in the Berlin salon of Fanny Hensel. The programme featured two songs and the premiere performances of the piano quartet by Robert and the piano trio by Clara Schumann. 25 years later, on a tour of England, she played a solo piano recital (an unusual practice at that time) featuring all the works that meant most to her: her husband’s “Scenes from Childhood” and works by Beethoven, Scarlatti, Chopin, Brahms and Mendelssohn, a programme that delighted her audience. She was announced as “Madame Schumann”. From over 1300 printed programmes, collected and preserved by the celebrated pianist over the course of her performing career, Ragna Schirmer opted for just these two. “The number of great works she studied and performed in the course of her life is quite amazing,” says Ragna Schirmer. “Another thing that fascinated me was the form, sequence and planning of her concerts. She played alongside the most important musicians of her time and most of her concerts reveal themselves to be varied compilations of different music genres.” Ragna Schirmer has long been recognized for her intimate engagement with the life of Clara Schumann. In April 2019, she will receive the Robert Schumann Prize of the City of Zwickau. “I have all her diaries at home, I have all her letters at home, I have all the biographies ever written, her children’s reminiscences ... I find it incredibly exciting to be involved with this life and I regard her as an essential role model.”",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=0301194BC&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Piano,Germany,2019 Edel Germany GmbH,2019 Edel Germany GmbH,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All around us we can hear snippets of the great works for string quartets, along with unfamiliar things to delight the ear; it is truly a music-lover's paradise. ""Chiaroscuro"" forms the conclusion of a rather special trilogy of albums by the Schumann Quartet and at the same time marks a journey's end. After searching for their own roots in ""Landscapes"" and engaging with their namesake Robert Schumann in ""Intermezzo"", the four musicians complete their trilogy with the album ""Chiaroscuro"", which in itself represents an equally exciting journey through time and temperament. By way of Mozart's arrangements of five selected fugues from Bach's ""Well-Tempered Clavier II"" they look left and right into very different musical rooms. There are two early pieces for string quartet by Shostakovich, Philip Glass's ""Company"" string quartet, a short fugue by Felix Mendelssohn, and the six Bagatelles op. 9 by Anton Webern. The whole promenade culminates in Janácek’s last work, his Second String Quartet. ""A few years ago we were even more inclined to do things 'the right way', or to fulfil other people's expectations of us."" In recent years, the young musicians have progressively released themselves from these demands. And perfected their own. ""We want our music to exist in the immediate moment, as we lose ourselves in it. For that to succeed, each of us must transcend their individual ego."" Their focus is on the concert, and that is the way they have approached ""Chiaroscuro"": ""We recommend everyone to listen to the whole album from beginning to end without a break."" ""Chiaroscuro"" – Italian for ""light and dark"" – is the name of the programme. The Schumann Quartet combines works that could not be more different. They aim to show that despite the contrasts, the differences and discontinuities between such pairs as Mozart and Webern, Glass and Janácek, there are glimpses of common elements and evidence that many of the composers on display are brothers in spirit. It is a question of the ""unity that the album forms"", perhaps not in spite of, but just because of the contrasts. And when at the very end of the album, at the very end of the whole trilogy, we hear Gershwin’s ""Lullaby"", we cannot shake off the feeling that all this is such stuff as dreams are made of.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=0301213BC&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Chamber Music,Germany,2019 Edel Germany GmbH,2019 Edel Germany GmbH,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Created at the peak of the collaboration between orchestra and conductor, Furtwängler’s artist personality is conveyed more vividly than anywhere else. What can be heard is music in which inspiration and the expressive will know no bounds and in which, not least, the existential experience of the Second World War reverberates. For the first time, the Berliner Philharmoniker are releasing a complete edition of these recordings. Wilhelm Furtwängler is accorded almost mythical status to this day. Biographically and artistically rooted in the 19th century, he embodies a bridge to the late Romantic period and the founding years of the Berliner Philharmoniker, whose chief conductor he was from 1922. Furtwängler’s auratic charisma stems from an intriguing basic interpretive concept which avoided authoritarian gestures and deliberately aimed at the blurring of tonal contours. The result was a warm, mixed sound, in which developments and intensifications never appear calculated, but seem to grow organically. This edition not only brings together all surviving radio recordings of the period, but also draws on the best available material – in particular, original tapes, which were taken to the Soviet Union after the war and only returned to Germany from the early 1990s onwards. Especially for this edition, the recordings have been carefully restored, digitally sampled using state-of-the-art technology and remastered in 24-bit resolution. A total of 21 concerts are presented here, in whole or in part. The edition’s features include numerous historical photos, articles on the history behind the recordings, plus an extensive essay by the American musicologist Richard Taruskin on Furtwängler’s art – all of which results in a release which provides an opportunity to discover and relive this great chapter in the history of the Berliner Philharmoniker in all its facets as never before.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=BPHR%20180181&medium=phy#,01 Classical,Classical,,Germany,2019 Berlin Phil Media GmbH,2018 Berlin Phil Media GmbH,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The disc opens with Printemps – a work originally for choir, piano and orchestra written in 1887 during Debussy’s stay in Italy as a winner of the Prix de Rome, but only published 25 years later in an orchestration made by Henri Büsser under the composer’s supervision. Three of the works that follow were commissions – the Rapsodie from a lady saxophonist, the Marche écossaise from an American general of Scottish descent and the Deux Dances from the instrument-maker Pleyel wanting to market a new model for a chromatic harp. Chronologically the last work on the programme, Berceuse héroique is Debussy's contribution to a tribute to the king of Belgium at the beginning of the Great War. Having rejected the idea of writing a heroic march in the safety of his own home he instead opted for a lullaby for piano, which he orchestrated the following year. The closing work on the disc, however, is Nocturnes, for which Debussy borrowed the title from a series of atmospheric paintings by James Whistler. Made up of three equally atmospheric movements, it is today one of Debussy’s best-loved compositions for orchestra. Nocturnes also forms the end of a trilogy of Debussy albums from the Singapore Symphony Orchestra and Lan Shui. Critical acclaim for the team range from ‘superb’ (BBC Music Magazine, about La mer) and ‘unquestionably world-class’ (Klassik-Heute.de, about the orchestra) to ‘a magnificent disc’ – the French magazine Classica’s verdict on the three ballet scores Jeux, Khamma and La Boîte à joujoux.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=BIS-2232&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Orchestral,EU,"2019 BIS Records AB, Sweden","2019 BIS Records AB, Sweden",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2019,BIS,BIS-2285,7318599922850,Johann Sebastian Bach ,Bach: The Lute Suites,Franz Halasz ,1,Hybrid SACD,15.59,23.99,"The universal appeal of the music of Johannes Sebastian Bach is such that most musicians, regardless of their instrument, long to play it. As a consequence, his works are constantly being arranged for other instruments – following a practice that Bach himself excelled at, repeatedly reworking his own music as well as that of others. A case in point are the four so-called lute suites, all of which now belong to the standard repertoire of most concert guitarists. To what extent they were originally composed for a plucked instrument has always been a matter of contention and has given rise to many hypotheses. They hail from various periods in Bach’s career, and range from youthful elan (BWV 996) by way of the zenith of artistic creativity (BWV 995, 1006a) to serene maturity (BWV 997). For this recording, Franz Halász has himself transcribed two of the suites, performing the others in arrangements by Ansgar Krause. For reasons of practicality, the suites in G minor and C minor are usually transposed when played on the guitar, but the present arrangements have made it possible to record all four works in their original keys for the first time on the guitar. An unusually generous playing time furthermore allows them to be collected on a single disc. Franz Halász appears on a number of acclaimed albums for BIS, in a wide-ranging repertoire including Bach’s three sonatas for solo violin, which he, according to one reviewer makes ‘entirely his own’ (BBC Music Magazine).",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=BIS-2285&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Guitar,EU,"2019 BIS Records AB, Sweden","2019 BIS Records AB, Sweden",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They stand apart from the more abstract and often more explicitly folk-related character of the music that we primarily associate with the composer. They are nevertheless major achievements that in different ways highlight Bartók’s imaginative use of the modern orchestra. Set in an enchanted forest, The Wooden Prince is based on a fairytale-like libretto featuring a prince and princess. The two are subjected to various trials, but at the end of the ballet they are allowed to come together and live – we assume – happily ever after. In stark contrast, The Miraculous Mandarin takes place in an urban brothel where three robbers force a girl to seduce men so that they can overpower and kill them. The subject-matter and the erotic qualities of much of the music caused a scandal at the première in 1926, and for a long time the score was primarily performed in the shorter concert version heard on the present release, the first from the team of the Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra and Susanna Mälkki, the orchestra’s chief conductor since 2016.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=BIS-2328&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Orchestral,EU,"2019 BIS Records AB, Sweden","2019 BIS Records AB, Sweden",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

No wonder then that other musicians than harpsichordists have wanted to make it their own – pianists, first and foremost, but also accordion players and guitarists, flautists and harpists. Having performed and recorded much of the classical as well as the modern string trio repertoire, Trio Zimmermann began working on the Goldberg Variations several years ago, playing an existing arrangement. But in their own words, the three members – among the leading string players of our time – ‘soon became captivated by the original score and its innumerable beauties and details’.

In 1730 the young Charles De Geer inherited the estate and the ironworks, and it was here that he kept his extensive collection of sheet music, including many volumes imported from Amsterdam but also works by composers based in or visiting Sweden, such as Hinrich Philip Johnsen and Conrad Friedrich Hurlebusch. Charles played the cello and the harpsichord, and it is probable that much of the music in the Leufsta collection will have been performed by members of the De Geer family themselves. The collection, now housed in the library of the University of Uppsala, thus offers fascinating insights into domestic music-making in 18th-century Sweden. This is the third album to present music from the collection, and the first to focus on vocal music. It also features the famous organ in the church belonging to the estate, built in 1728 by Johan Niclas Cahman.

The programme is organized as a triptych, focusing on three distinctive compositional styles. First, all surviving Berlin works for piano solo are presented in chronological order, showing how the young composer was reacting to the new and exciting jazz/dance music, but also to the people around him and to events in the musical world of Berlin in the 1920s. This is followed by Suites Nos 2, 3 and 4, a group of mature works composed at the beginning of World War II (1940–41). Closing the release, finally, is the dance suite The Gnomes, probably composed in 1939 and one of a group of piano scores for ballets with Greek subjects.

Prokofiev and Scriabin both conceived their respective collections for the piano, and it is later arrangers that have adapted them for string orchestra. Rudolf Barshai took on Prokofiev’s Visions Fugitives in 1962, selecting 15 of the 20 brief pieces and arranging them for his own ensemble, the Moscow Chamber Orchestra. Scriabin’s Preludes received a similar treatment in 1999 when the Finnish composer Jouni Kaipainen chose 13 from the original 24, rearranging the order they appear in and transposing them in some cases. As for Anton Arensky (1861—1909), he composed his set of variations as the third movement of a string quartet, taking the theme from a song by Tchaikovsky and letting it undergo a series of transformations. Cheered by the success of the piece, he made his own arrangement for larger forces, a version which remains one of his best-known works. Tchaikovsky’s Elegy, finally, is actually heard here as it was composed, in 1884, but the piece saw the light of day as ‘A Thankful Greeting’ and was renamed ‘Elegy’ only at the time of publication, before making a final reappearance, as part of the composer’s music to Hamlet.

When pressed, a number of them would also remember the so-called F.A.E. Sonata, a collaborative effort by the young Brahms, Albert Dietrich and their mentor Robert Schumann. But very few would probably think of the two Opus 120 sonatas, composed in 1894 for clarinet (or viola) and piano, but a year later published in the composer’s own version for the violin. As the range of the B flat clarinet goes a fourth lower than that of the violin, Brahms had been forced to make considerable revisions to the clarinet part – which in turned entailed changes in the piano part, and consequently the printing of a new piano score. The seasoned team of violinist Ulf Wallin and pianist Roland Pöntinen have now decided to record all the Brahms sonatas, and the results are being released on two albums, the first one including the first of the ‘official’ sonatas, No. 1 in G major, Op. 78, the F minor Sonata from Op. 120 and Brahms’s Scherzo from the F.A.E.

From early on he was profoundly influenced by the medieval tradition of Icelandic literature, preserved in a handful of manuscripts, including the Poetic Edda and the Prose Edda. Leifs’ magnum opus is the Edda oratorio, a massive (although incomplete) work in three large parts which occupied him on and off for most of his composing career – from around 1930 to his death in 1968. A partial performance of Edda I – The Creation of the World – met with incomprehension, and Leifs only resumed work on his great project a decade later, completing the second part – The Lives of the Gods – in 1966. He immediately started on the third part of the oratorio, and was still working on it at the time of his death. Neither of the two finished parts were performed in his lifetime, Edda I receiving its first complete performance in 2006 and Edda II in 2018, in conjunction with the recording of the present disc. Leifs’ music is as ruggedly grandiose as its subject matter and the score calls for vocal soloists, choir and large orchestra, making huge demands on the performers.

Schubert began to write the score in January 1819 and completed it within three-four months; but the usual show-business conspiracies kept it a long time in wait for its first performance, which took place on the 14th of June, 1820. High quality levels are to be found in the grand aria for Lieschen “Der Vater mag wohl immer Kind mich nennen” (n. 3): it has both vocal virtuosity and a skilful accompaniment based on the idyllic sound of the woodwinds. Other parts are noteworthy: the comic arrogance in the short aria for Franz “Mag es stürmen, donnern, blitzen” (n. 4), which sounds delightfully old-fashioned in its abundance of naively descriptive hints; the short bustling, even a little bit devilish, concertato ensemble “Packt ihn, führt ihn vor Gericht” (n. 9), a mass scene where we find the rushing counterpoint of the quintet and the sharp homophony of the chorus allied with a rapidly shifting harmonic texture. Such effects show that the twenty-two-years-old beginner was already well aware of how to use his compositional mastership for dramatic purposes.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=GB2225-3&medium=phy#,01 Classical,Classical,,Italy,1998 Bongiovanni,1998 Bongiovanni,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Only when the centenary of Schubert’s death was approaching, the publics of Dresden and Vienna were allowed to see it on stage, in September 1896 and at the beginning of 1897, respectively. Although it raised widespread curiosity and favorable reviews, the work soon disappeared again from the current opera-house repertoire. Today, even in German-speaking countries, it is seldom revived in concert performances, mainly on account of its lively Overture in two movements (Larghetto-Allegro), of the charming opening chorus, and of the quaint scene VI, consisting of a merry military march plus a chorus filled with a coarse sense of humor, which anticipates the features of the forthcoming Viennese light opera.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=GB2229-3&medium=phy#,01 Classical,Classical,,Italy,2019 Bongiovanni,1998 Bongiovanni,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In his Third Symphony in D major, D. 200, written in the early summer of 1815 and probably first performed at a private concert, the eighteen-year-old Schubert emancipated himself from the style copies of his First and Second Symphonies and finally found his own musical expression. None of his symphonies would be heard in public during his lifetime, however; the Third was first performed as late as 1881 in London, where it was immediately received with great enthusiasm. Schumann's First Symphony in B flat major, op 38 (after an unfinished symphony he wrote in his youth) was an impressive success for the 31-year-old composer. Two months after its completion, in January 1841, the work was premiered by Felix Mendelssohn at the Leipzig Gewandhaus to great public acclaim. Both works emanate youthful freshness and a profoundly positive attitude to life. Robert Schumann's ""Spring Symphony"", which he said was ""born in a fiery hour"", took him just four days to sketch out. Schubert’s Third Symphony was composed in only nine days, and, with its dance-like effervescence and enthusiasm, could equally well have been called a “Spring Symphony” by his contemporaries.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=BRK900176&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Classical Era,Germany,BRmedia Service GmbH,BRmedia Service GmbH,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They never got a chance to play his smart and funny Ulysses at the Edge of the World, but this “Minor Adventure in Rhythm” really swings in time signatures that would have made Dave Brubeck blush. So opens a collection of Partch classics that no one has really heard before. His score for the film Windsong was edited for the soundtrack, and though music lovers will recognize the material from the subsequently expanded Daphne of the Dunes, the symphonically structured original is much more dramatically crafted, and is presented here for the first time. It turns out that there are actually Twelve Intrusions, too, not eleven. And a demented sonata? Oh yes! Though the composer never performed or recorded it, his 1950 composition Sonata Dementia is in three movements: I. Abstraction & Delusion, II. Scherzo Schizophrenia, and III. Allegro Paranoia. Filled to the brim with humor, flights of fancy, and a febrile imagination, it was later reworked as “Ring Around the Moon,” but what a treat to hear the original in all its zany glory. The Bonus Tracks reveal even more lost treasures: here is the original 1904 Edison recording of the Native American “Cançion” that Partch had transcribed in the 1930s and used to close his final Intrusion “Cloud Chamber Music.” But best of all, the first-ever recording of Partch as performer, playing what is probably his most famous piece, Barstow: 8 Hitchhiker Inscriptions in front of a live audience in 1942, just a year after it was written.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=BCD9525&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,United States,"2019 Bridge Records, Inc.

No one, not even the most dedicated Tosti singers such as Gigli and Caruso, had ever addressed Tosti’s oeuvre with anything near a comprehensive approach. Yet the chronological approach to his work taken by this project proves that he was certainly not confined within the limited universe of love requited, rejected, desired, misunderstood, suffered or unspoken. The songs in this third volume cover the last decade of the 19th century, by which time Tosti had settled in London, been appointed singing teacher to the royal family and to a professorship at the Royal Academy of Music. Despite their relative youth, the singers chosen to record this project are all Tosti experts, having won various editions of Ortona’s international voice competition devoted to the interpretation of drawingroom songs and ballads. Other actors of lesser skill almost always seem to be portraying the same person. Much the same thing can happen with music, but not here, thanks to the light, graceful and lively address of the singers to the wide range of poets set by Tosti, including Victor Hugo, Jules Barbier, Alfred de Musset and Frederic Weatherly as well as less-familiar lyricists such as Barry Cornwall and Ada Negri.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=BRI95431&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Germany,2019 Brilliant Classics,2019 Brilliant Classics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With volume 7 we have reached a pair of opus numbers which offer typical contrasts within Dussek’s idiom. The pair of Op.47 sonatas belong to the genre of the ‘Sonate facile’ – easy sonatas, uncomplicated technically and musically, much like Beethoven’s Op.49, published three years later. The finale of Op.47 No.1 is a ‘Rondo à la Militaire’ which became a famous hit of the period. Indeed, this was a time when Dussek reached the zenith of his fame as performer and composer, with his works and playing conquering the entire continent from England to Russia, and the Op.47 Sonatas were first published in London, despite the composer having fled the capital in disgrace, leaving behind serious debts and a failing marriage. The great Sonata Op.64, ‘Le Retour à Paris’, is, by contrast, one of Dussek’s most expansive and ambitious works. Composed following his return to the French capital in 1807 after the death of his patron, Prince Louis Ferdinand of Prussia, it is not so much a programmatic sonata as an evocation of Dussek’s feelings on his return to the city which he had left just before the French Revolution in 1789. After the bittersweet impressions of the city irrevocably changed by the Revolution and Napoleon’s ascent in the first two movements, a feeling of despair and attempts of reconciliation with fate can be heard in the Scherzo, giving way to the new happy and carefree way of life in the witty final rondo. Zvi Meniker is a Russian-born Israeli harpsichordist, organist, fortepianist and conductor, now a professor at the Hochschule für Musik in Hannover. He has made a speciality of studying, teaching and performing the piano music of early Romantics such as Mendelssohn, Chopin and indeed Dussek.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=BRI95606&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Germany,2019 Brilliant Classics,2019 Brilliant Classics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Born in the south of Italy in 1781, Mauro Giuliani settled in Vienna in 1806 and quickly became famous as the greatest living guitarist. As the city’s leading light in the classical guitar movement, Giuliani was a teacher, performer and composer of a rich repertory for the instrument (nearly 150 works with opus number, 70 without), much of which Brilliant Classics has recorded to an extent unrivalled by any other label. With this album we turn to the combination of violin and guitar which inspired a great deal of attractive music written for amateur performers, often featuring operatic melodies in variation sets such as Giuliani composed for the opening of his Op.25 Duo Concertant and the second movement of his Op.125 Serenade. Composed in Vienna in 1812, the Op.25 work is the most complex and imposing duo of the genre, beginning with an expansive sonata-form movement and continuing with a lyrical set of variations in which the two instruments alternate between soloist and accompanist. The influence of Giuliani’s most famous Viennese contemporary can also be felt in the Op.87 Duo Concertant, where an elegant Allegro maestoso is followed by an Andante molto sostenuto of almost Beethoven-like impact. Next comes a Scherzo that begins with a restless series of grace notes on the violin and a slight discrepancy between meter and rhythm that is reminiscent of certain Beethoven scherzos. The Serenade dates from after Giuliani’s return to his Italian homeland in 1819, and it also reflects a more traditional disposition of instruments, where the violin stars as the protagonist. Nevertheless Giuliani’s invention and Viennese experience may be relished in the brilliance of the concluding Rondo, which includes a disoriented reference to Papageno’s music in The Magic Flute.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=BRI95735&medium=phy#,01 Classical,Classical,,Germany,2019 Brilliant Classics,2019 Brilliant Classics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Yet his music remains under-recorded and under-appreciated, which is all the more curious in the case of his output for chamber music where he most nearly lives up to that unfair nickname. Aside from the late Violin Sonata, elliptical and no less Brahmsian in its way than its companions, all these works are conceived on a grand scale, abundant in soaring melody and impassioned lyricism, playing always to the strengths of their instrumentation and demanding the utmost in energy and commitment from their performers. Composed first, the Piano Quartet is dark and densely textured like its companions, but it also makes the warmest and most loving embrace of the listener, from the piano’s opening outburst of passion onwards. In the right hands this is music it’s impossible not to love- and hard to forget, too, in the case of the Adagio’s yearning main theme. The Piano Trio emulates not only Taneyev’s friend Tchaikovsky but older German models, Beethoven in particular, with its independence of parts where the piano stands as first among equals. By turns impetuous and imperial, the Trio gives the lie to the old idea of Taneyev as presenting a sternly unyielding countenance. Perhaps the most fully formed of this magnificent quartet is the Piano Quintet, where a Mendelssohnian lightness of touch in the Scherzo and finale counterbalances Taneyev at his most intense and contrapuntally driven in the huge opening Allegro. Joined here by three experienced Italian colleagues, Daniela Cammarano and Alessandro Deljavan have previously won critical praise for their Brilliant Classics albums of chamber music by Johann Nepomuk Hummel and Anton Rubinstein.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=BRI95766&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Germany,2019 Brilliant Classics,2019 Brilliant Classics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This set sheds light on the little-known composer’s repertoire, from the rhapsodies, the concertos, to ten sweeping symphonies. Brun grew up in Lucerne and his time active as a composer coincided with a period of high creative output of Swiss music. Brun’s repertoire sits alongside other native composers such as Honegger, Schoeck, and Bloch. The crowded market, combined with the struggle to find a publisher, offers one indication as to why Brun’s works failed to reach the mainstream public. While not a household name, Brun is often touted as the Swiss answer to Vaughan Williams and Edward Elgar. Brun’s works have a nostalgic touch; they draw on the Romantic and Classical eras in their emotional sincerity and defined forms, but always with a modern flavor. After graduating from the Cologne conservatoire, Brun worked in Berlin, London and Dortmund where he took up various music posts. His music reflects his European travels and unites diverse inspirations from different countries and eras as equals on his musical plane. Modernist influences are skillfully interwoven into his compositions, the scherzo movements for example, draw on Stravinsky in their timbre and rhythms and Symphony No. 5 liberally experiments with tonality. However, similar to his English counterparts, his music remains rooted in his homeland. Symphony No. 3 is inspired by the Alps and it is his best known work, made particularly famous for its use of Italian-Swiss folk melodies. In his later life, Brun returned to Switzerland, where he served as director of the Berne Music Society until his retirement in 1941. The final portion of this release features historical recordings, in particular, the celebrated Paul Sacher brings his interpretation of Variations for string orchestra and piano, and Brun conducts his own Symphony No. 8.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=BRI95784&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Germany,2019 Brilliant Classics,2019 Brilliant Classics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Scarlatti: Sonatas,Nicola Reniero ,1,CD,7.79,11.99,"Played by the right hands, the astonishing freshness of invention of Scarlatti’s sonatas emerges with no less brilliance on the piano than his intended harpsichord. So why not the organ, too? In fact, Scarlatti probably intended only three of his 555 surviving keyboard sonatas specifically for an organ. Yet even on the instruments of his own time, in churches and chapels across Europe and especially his native Italy and adopted home of Spain, the palette of colors offered by a well-appointed organ brings these vibrantly colored works to life without any fear of them being obscured by clouds of bass pedal or resonance. Organist Nicola Reniero explains that his selection of 19 sonatas concentrates on particularly intricate or individual examples of polyphony and fugue where the organ’s diversity of register and color may be thought to excel. He does so, however, without neglecting the principle that in Scarlatti’s music almost everything is vocal and theatrical: the introduction is like the curtain that rises; the themes are the characters, and the various sections of the piece are like scenes of a wordless drama. Reniero has chosen to avoid the kind of echo effects which would be a conventional way to introduce contrast between phrases: “I have tried instead to emphasize the originality of the harmonies or the characters of famous themes.” The album closes with the most spectacular of all Scarlatti’s fugues, K417 in D minor. It is a stunning piece not only on account of the frenzied finale and the unexpected change of scene that comes about halfway through the piece, but above all for the boundless energy that pervades it throughout. For this new recording, Reniero plays the organ of the Duomo di Desenzano in the town of Garda, a two-manual instrument first reconstructed by the Serassi Brothers and then restored and partially rebuilt by Marco Fratti in 2014.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=BRI95817&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Germany,2019 Brilliant Classics,2019 Brilliant Classics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, as La Folia or La Follia, the theme has been improvised on and updated ever since then, all drawing on the noble dignity of the original and its simple, effective power. Born in 1956, Carlo Pedini produced a half-hour set of variations on ‘La Follia’ in 2007, and scored them for string orchestra: this is the first internationally available recording, made by an ensemble drawn from the string section of the KLK Symphony Orchestra in Ukraine. They are conducted here by a contemporary and countryman of Pedini’s Ferdinando Nazzaro, who founded the new-music ensemble attached to the KLK orchestra. Complementing La Follia here is another neo-Baroque work of Pedini’s, a set of three substantial pieces for string orchestra with a central adagio and a finale dedicated to the art of the neoclassical painter Antonio Canova. The album concludes with a second set of ‘La Follia’ variations by Paolo Ugoletti, also born in 1956 and a fellow student of Franco Donatoni. These take the theme into the territory of pop, with variations marked ‘Boogie-Woogie’ and ‘Funky’ using innovative string techniques.

According to La Stampa, the ensemble ranks among the most inspiring and authoritative Vivaldi interpreters of our time. Part of this collection was released separately in 2015, and attracted glowing reviews: ‘The tempi are well chosen, without exaggerations, but also without being too slow… Italian ensembles have shown that [these Sinfonias] are more than nice fillers in a programme of solo concertos. In this recording the polyphonic, theatrical and expressive qualities of these pieces are brought to light´ What sets apart these concertos and sinfonias from the multitude of other such works composed by Vivaldi is the lack of a solo instrument. Yet with his usual, inexhaustible fertility of invention, Vivaldi turned this apparent lack into an opportunity to explore the possibilities of development and counterpoint more extensively than was possible in the oppositional and accompanimental language of the solo concertos. After a dashing opening movement there is generally a central Adagio, in the form of a tripartite song or a simple sequence of chords. This is followed by a lively, dance-like movement in two parts with two refrains. On occasion this finale is replaced by a technically superlative Fugue that displays Vivaldi’s mastery of counterpoint. Sometimes the Fugue is placed at the beginning of the Concerto, perhaps implying the original context of the work as the instrumental introduction to a solemn Mass. In complement to the concertos, the Sinfonias generally feature bolder and more brilliant string writing, evidently for use as the curtain-raiser to a theatrical event, though they now stand perfectly well on their own.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=BRI95835&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Germany,2019 Brilliant Classics,2019 Brilliant Classics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An accomplished young Italian ensemble takes us from the purism of ‘New York Counterpoint’ by Steve Reich through the soulful strains of the Saxophone Quartet by Philip Glass, to the funky rhythms of Michael Torke’s ‘July’ and the catchy offbeats of Michael Nyman’s Second String Quartet, in a version for saxophones which here receives its world premiere recording. Back in 1968 it was Nyman who coined the term Minimalism, in an article for ‘The Spectator’, to describe music by composers such as Cornelius Cardew that could be relied upon for its effect in clearing a listener’s mind. ‘Simple idea, straightforward structure, intellectual control, theatrical presence and intensity in presentation’: these were the other criteria he applied to music or at any rate musical events masterminded by Nam June Paik and the ‘Naked Cellist’, Charlotte Moorman. By that point, Reich and Glass had already been writing influential pieces such as It’s gonna rain which shared the qualities listed by Nyman. Their works for saxophone date from later in their careers, once Minimalism had been established as an unstoppable cultural force that had brought millions of young listeners into concert halls. They were attracted by the hypnotic repetitions that are a trademark of these pieces, particularly suited to the medium of saxophone quartet, but even more to the rhythmic rigor and fresh yet recognisable harmonies shared by all four works here.

Gilardino’s own work is complemented here by his transcription of ‘Andalucia,’ a piano cycle by the Cuban composer Ernesto Lecuona, as Gilardino himself observes in a booklet essay, the cycle belongs to the Spanish heritage of Albeniz and Granados: “It seemed appropriate to make this version for four guitars that, while not competing with the dynamic range of the piano original, nonetheless lives up to the color and brilliance of Lecuona’s inspiration.”",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=BRI95911&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Germany,2019 Brilliant Classics,2019 Brilliant Classics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

His large output of music for harpsichord is the result of a long association with many of its leading exponents, with resulting requests and commissions, and has attracted a circle of admirers. By contrast, his equally distinctive and idiomatic writing for the piano has in only two instances been prompted by commissions. All the rest has arisen from purely personal impulses. This recording serves as an introduction to it. Understandably, a good deal of other piano music preceded No. l (1959). No.2 was commissioned by Thomas McIntosh, who gave the premiere at the Queen Elizabeth Hall, London in 1975. It was this work, in addition to several items of chamber music, which introduced Stephen Dodgson to Bernard Roberts. Their association was strengthened when an American admirer of Bernard Roberts commissioned No 3 (1983) especially for him. All subsequent sonatas, now stretching to No.6 (1997) have been premiered by Roberts, who has thereby become an important stimulus in their genesis. Stephen Dodgson was for many years a teacher at the Royal College of Music, London, where he had himself been a student post-war. For 40 years he has been a well-known reviewer/commentator on the radio in addition to supplying many scores for BBC drama productions over the years. He continues an active and still developing career as composer from his home in London. Bernard Roberts Bernard Roberts has long been acknowledged as one of Britain’s leading pianists.

During his later years, however, the influence of Johannes Brahms – which surely was intentional – became clearly audible. This also applies to the three works for violoncello and piano recorded here. Brahms held this composer born in Mannheim in 1865 in such high regard that he even offered him his advice in compositional matters. And in some of the movements of Kahn’s Cello Sonata No. 1 – for example, in the mirthful and playful finale – both Brahms and Schumann are recognizable as very important forerunners who stimulated his compositional development. Kahn’s tendency to compose short expressive pieces is displayed in the Three Pieces for Violoncello and Piano op. 25. The Romance in F minor in the first position is a highly expressive song piece – to a certain extent a »song without words« in the manner of Mendelssohn’s piano compositions of this sort. And from the very beginning of the Cello Sonata No. 2 there can be no doubt about Kahn’s ties to German Romanticism. The thematic design of the first movement could have been thought up by Brahms or even by Beethoven before him.

He took a work by Carl Heinrich Graun, a composer whom he admired, and expanded it to produce a magnificent two-part Passion. To it he added compositions of his own authorship and others by his friend Georg Philipp Telemann. The result was a pasticcio, a new work consisting of various set pieces. This practice was very common during Bach’s times. Both composers on whose works Bach drew were contemporary stars who did not at all object to this practice, especially since they occasionally operated in precisely the same way. The composer Georg Philipp Telemann saw no reason to complain about the reuse of his works. Although we do have quite a bit of background information about the Passion, the riddle surrounding it is only beginning to be solved. Accordingly, Bach scholarship can only hope that additional sources will be found and prove Johann Sebastian Bach’s authorship once and for all. The work perhaps even offers evidence pointing to one of his lost Passions, and it might even be his last Passion oratorio – which, as the current state of research knowledge sees things – can only have been written during the years following 1733.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=555270-2&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Germany,2019 cpo,2019 cpo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Victor Schiøler was born in 1899 into a musical family, the son of Victor Bendix, a composer and conductor whose name is also to be found in the Danacord catalogue, and Augusta Schiøler, a pianist. Apart from his mother his teachers included Ignaz Friedman and Arthur Schnabel and he made his debut in 1914. He pursued an energetic career as pianist, conductor and musical organizer, which was interrupted during the rise of Nazism and the German occupation of Denmark. He firmly resisted any collaboration with the Nazi powers and the hiatus allowed him to develop another interest, that of medicine, in which he graduated. In 1943 he fled to Sweden with his wife and resumed concert work. Concert tours dominated his life once more until, at a rather late age, he succeeded in having a son and cut back on his concert work in order to dedicate himself as much as possible to his family.

While at Bad Ischl, his constant encounters with J. Strauss, but also with the great clarinetist Richar Mühlfeld, inspired Brahms to produce such fine examples of the chamber music repertoire known today. The 2 clarinet sonatas, which he also transcribed for the viola, are quite melancholic in comparison with the other clarinet opuses which he wrote just before. Brahms was also deeply saddened by the sudden loss of his great friend and muse Clara Schumann. As they shared wonderful long term artistic and personal relationship, quite possibly they influenced each other in their composing as well. The project “Brahms Alliance” is inspired by the friendship and legacy of those 2 much celebrated composers with the addition of the remarkable singer and composer Pauline Viardot who is represented in the project by her lovely 6 pieces for violin and piano (version for viola).

Granata’s selection demonstrates how composers strove to get the most out of the harp by pushing for experimental technical demands without forcing its sound or calling for unnatural tempi; this was often with Haydn being involved in providing advice to composers and performers alike. As further witnesses of Haydn’s penchant for the harp Chiara Granata includes in her programme a selection of folk melodies from the British Isles arranged by the composer, then (in Stendhal’s words) “full of glory and year”. Here she is joined by countertenor Raffaele Pe, violinist Anaïs Chen and cellist Marco Ceccato. Other composers utilized Haydn’s compositions as inspiration for their own, as can be heard in Nicolas-Charles Bochsa’s Petite Mosaique sur La Creation d’Haydn or even made arrangements of his symphonies, such as was the case with Louis-Charles Ragué. Chiara Granata (a pupil of that treasured Glossa artist, Mara Galassi) plays two instruments built at the time of the compositions making up this delightful programme: a Holtzman harpe à crochet and a single-action harp by Naderman, the latter employed for the solo tour de force that is Boscha’s Petite Mosaique.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=GCD923517&medium=phy#,01 Classical,Classical,,Austria,2019 note 1 music gmbh,2019 note 1 music gmbh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With the increased use of the six-course instrument, writing for the lute became more polyphonic, with a greater level of complexity and frequently making use of existing musical works such as the chanson Il est bel et bon by Pierre Passereau; the system – called tablature – of graphically representing this complexity was introduced as the 16th century commenced. Curiously, Marco made an early petition to hold the rights to the printing of tablature in Venice. Yet apparently, no imprints from him appeared and very little of his own music was printed for some three decades. The story of how some of Marco’s music has survived to this day and the relationship that his kind of compositions – often Ricercari but also an early example of a Fantasia – had with the paintings of Giorgione is engagingly told by Lukas Henning in the booklet essay to this new recording. Henning, whose credentials as a performer and as an investigator are backed by his having studied at the prestigious Schola Cantorum Basiliensis – and with no less a star in the lutenist firmament than Hopkinson Smith –, intersperses this new selection of works by Marco dall’Aquila with some of his own sympathetic and informed compositions – including a delightful piece which explores the nightmare of breaking a string!",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=GCD923518&medium=phy#,01 Classical,Classical,,Austria,2019 note 1 music gmbh,2019 note 1 music gmbh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The sonata was recorded in the castle Les Faugs in Ardèche, where d’Indy lived – the same place where the work was composed in 1907.

The four-part chorale “Gloria sei dir gesungen” at the end of the work is taken from his father’s cantata of the same name (BWV 140). No specific occasion for the motet’s composition is known, and the work can be only approximately dated to the mid-1780s. Many passages written to show off the singer’s virtuosity are in the direct tradition of his father, who often gave his vocal writing an instrumental treatment – in accordance with his conviction that “everything must be possible”. The singers often found that this approach to composition tested them to the limit of their powers. We do not know the extent of Altnickol’s musical output. Very few of his compositions have survived.

However, we learn from the solo-tutti supplements and the court account books that the ensemble was in fact larger and more polyphonic than the original, simple manuscript and the subsequent modern score suggest: occasionally the number of bassoons was equal to that of the cellos, though they were only given solo parts when they were disengaged from the bass group of instruments. It was common practice too – not in Cöthen or Hamburg, it is true, but certainly in Dresden, Paris and London – for at least two if not three oboists to be assigned to each part, these being augmented by special instruments such as the old-style recorder and the new transverse flute, and after 1750 the Clarinet. The Concerto Opus 3, no. 1 requires a total of six obbligato wind instruments (two oboes, two recorders and two bassoons) and is therefore no ""odd man out"" composition, but rather reproduces fairly accurately the minimum range that an orchestra at Handel's disposal would have comprised: in the middle movement of the concerto, two ripieno oboists take up recorders, and then return to the fold as oboists afterwards.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=HC19031&medium=phy#,01 Classical,Classical,,Austria,2019 Profil Medien GmbH,2019 Profil Medien GmbH,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Elder is a superb Wagnerian, acutely conscious of the complex relationship between tempo and pace, and immaculate in his judgment both of the span of each act and the ebb and flow of detail within it. Thrilling climaxes alternated with moments of astonishing beauty and quiet, almost exquisite terror.” (The Guardian on the Halle’s performance of Siegfried) The third element of Wagner’s Ring cycle contains humor, drama and a concluding ecstasy as the eponymous hero meets his heroine Brünnhilde, setting up the explosive finale of the concluding opera. With enormous orchestral forces and dramatic use of leitmotiv themes the music portrays the full gamut of emotions and provides a perfect vehicle to display the heights of the Hallé’s powers under Elder.

Says Jones (now 90 and still writing for the stage): “I think Philemon may well be the most interesting show Harvey and I ever created. It has a strong story and a haunting score, and it takes the musical theater form into places it had never been before. “I am overjoyed that Harbinger is re-releasing the original cast album so more people can discover it.” Jones’s inspiration for the musical was a passage in Allardyce Nicoll’s book Masks, Mimes and Miracles about a Roman clown who, during the reign of Diocletian, impersonated a Christian leader and slowly turned into the man he was impersonating. Dick Latessa won an Obie Award as Cockian, the clown who becomes Philemon, and the musical itself won the Outer Critics Award as best of the season.

All these aesthetic approaches co-existed naturally and became entwined in the works of composers whose language was constantly evolving. Within this musical context, the artistic lives began of three important Catalan composers of three consecutive generations: Joan Manén (1883-1971), Robert Gerhard (1896-1970) and Xavier Montsalvatge (1912 -2002): composers whose extensive output has been performed and received international recognition, and who set out to find their own personal voice from the starting points of different musical styles.

One way or another, Chopin was the one who became the pianist’s guiding light. In 1949, she shared the first prize of the International Chopin Piano Competition in Warsaw with the celebrated Polish pianist Halina Czerny-Stefanska. At that time, she was a student of the Moscow Conservatory where she studied under two prominent representatives of the Russian piano school, Konstantin Igumnov and (after the latter’s death) Yakov Flier.

In 1979, following her son, violinist and conductor Dmitri Sitkovetsky, she left for the USA where she gave a triumphant recital at Carnegie Hall. She played at some of the well-known venues of the American and European continents and taught at the Juilliard School in New York. She played in Moscow again a decade later.

We used three stunning pianos dating from the mid-19th century from the Gert Hecher collection in Vienna and moved them to the famous Ehrbar Hall, where Brahms himself often performed, for the recording. To complement the sound of the pianos the three strings players changed their set ups to closely resemble the string sound of the period, using a combination of uncovered and covered gut strings.” Pianist John Thwaites recalls: “I chose a Blüthner, an Ehrbar and a Streicher - the latter identical to the instrument given to Brahms in 1868. We know Brahms visited the Ehrbar Hall in the 1870’s and 80’s to try his symphonies and piano concertos on two pianos.” The Primrose Piano Quartet has previously recorded Romantic repertoire to great acclaim with their award-winning recordings for the Meridian label including works by Schubert, Fauré and Richard Strauss. Alongside their performances of the major repertoire, they have revived a number of remarkable and unjustly neglected 20th century English piano quartets, as well as giving a platform to contemporary composers, including Sir Peter Maxwell-Davies, Sally Beamish, John Casken and Anthony Payne, whose works have been written for and premièred by them.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=CDE84650&medium=phy#,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Chamber Music,United Kingdom,2019 Meridian Records,2019 Meridian Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The huge success of the Italian concerto grosso was a response to the necessity of freeing music from a secondary role to which it found itself confined, notably in France with ballet music. Unaffected by the rivalry between French and Italian music, the British seemed to be attracted by purely instrumental music; the concerto grosso consequently afforded them a freshness, a boldness, and a hint of unique maestria that held an immediate appeal. Thus it was that the concerto grosso emigrated, as did a number of Italian composers who responded to the emotional needs and the demands of an English ‘market’ that encouraged artistic initiative, promised financial satisfaction, and offered the opportunity of achieving fame. This was the case with Francesco Scarlatti, the brother of the celebrated Alessandro, who made almost his whole career in London and Dublin. Few of his works have survived beyond the six concerti grossi featured on this programme. You are invited by the young Polish ensemble {oh!} Orkiestra Historyczna, conducted by its first violin Martyna Pastuszka, to journey from Italy to the United Kingdom.

But a budding career as a solo pianist – she was was among the 3 finalists in the International Piano Concerto Competition in Dudley, UK in 1974 – was augmented by composition with her arrival at The London Contemporary Dance Theatre in 1978. Under the inspirational leadership of its Artistic Director Robert Cohan, she became one of the very few pianists with the deepest understanding of modern dance and her company class improvisations became the stuff of legend.

Recent years have brought a vast expansion in our understanding and knowledge of early music periods. There has been investigation into the repertoire and techniques of other ages, coupled with a movement that has favored the use of instruments and ways of playing them that are more or less authentic. Even where surviving historical instruments or modern reproductions of them are not used, the styles of performance have been influenced. Above all the myth of unending progress has been abandoned in favor of an evaluation of each period and type of music on its own terms. Early Music, in fact, has become a flourishing industry, stimulated by the remarkable growth in production and distribution of early music. For our present purposes we limit the term Early Music to cover a period ranging from plainchant to the end of the 17th century.

The pieces invoke feelings of meditation and anticipation that convey a wonderful sense of storytelling, and hearing about Albanese's inspiration for these only strengthens their narrative. Take ""The Stars We Follow"", a piece as gentle and contemplative as it is powerful. The track was inspired by Japanese master Aoki Hiroyuki and the special practice he developed in order to connect to nature, ""It's something between a martial art and a dance. At some point Lucy sent me a short clip where they do a session of this on a beach, and I thought somehow the movements were like chasing stars,"" explains Albanese, ""as well as the general idea of all these elders travelling, and following their own ideas and stars and trying to communicate them with the world."" The wonderfully comforting piece ""North Variation"" was inspired by Master Lyudmila Khomovna, one of the last people of Uilta decent living in a remote island in Siberia, ""She is a very particular person, and profoundly elder, a very wise person. I was having this idea in mind of something set in a very cold place but with a deep warmth within,"" says Albanese. ""The Twelve"" cemented Federico Albanese’s abilities to work outside his comfort zone. Being simultaneously able to adapt to the collaborative efforts of filmmaking while following his own internal creative process, his album demonstrates the added value of organic partnerships between artists, ""I would say cinema is my second love besides music. I'm probably not the kind of person who is willing to write music for anything, I am happy to pledge to a project when I can see there is something I can give to it.""",https://vimeo.com/228518787,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=0301211NM&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Soundtrack,Germany,2019 Edel Germany GmbH,2019 Edel Germany GmbH,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This group included many of today’s leading Canadian composers such as Rose Bolton, Paul Frehner, Nicole Lizee, Scott Godin, and Brian Current, and dedicated performers from McGill’s Contemporary Music Ensemble (led by Bruce Mather and, later, Denys Bouliane), the members of the Bozzini Quartet and violist Pemi Paull. It was a transitional generation: the composers were moving away from avant-gardism and re-embracing popular forms, looking away from academia and creating their own groups while still dependent on the local institutions for support and recognition. It was a unique time of intense creation and collaboration that has had a lasting effect on the Canadian new music scene, as the composers’ lives and careers spread them to communities coast to coast, introducing their work to new audiences and a new generation of students. The three works presented here were selected to represent this Canadian voice in new chamber music. The works were championed by Music in the Barns from 2011-2015 as part of their vision to advance this voice within the international musical community.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=FCR226&medium=phy#,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Contemporary Era,Canada,Music in the Barns,Music in the Barns,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Maurice Delafosse (1870-1926) had speculated that the Berber expression akal-n-iguinaouen (“land of the Blacks”) could have given rise to the words “Guinea” and “Gnawa” by phonetic similarity and that “Gnawa” could therefore mean a “black” person, or someone “from the land of the Blacks”. In the absence of conclusive historical data, this phonetic relationship gave rise to the hypothetical Sub-Saharan origin of the Gnawa and their rituals. Contemporary researchers now admit that identifying the origin of this people from a word is unreasonable today, especially since the Gnawa of Morocco are not all black, Arab or Muslim. They also co-exist in Berber and Jewish communities. According to new evidence, the Gnawa have been Moroccan for generations and are not all descendants of slaves. The Gnawa of Morocco have a very rich ritual and symbolic tradition which is performed notably in lila. This album is devoted to the third phase of these ritual nights –the Mlouk (“the possessors”)– and offers a sample of an ecstatic moment of the lila when, moving through the seven colours, the maâlem and the community around him occupy the sanctified space.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=C%20560283&medium=phy#,30 World/Int'l.,World,,Austria,2019 RADIO FRANCE,2019 RADIO FRANCE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At a relatively early point in his career, in 1875, he issued “A short textbook of harmony, adapted to the reading of spiritual and musical compositions in Russia”, which in 1881 was approved as a textbook of church singing in theological seminaries and colleges. The same year, Tchaikovsky even started editing the works of Dmitry Bortnyansky, a pioneer of sacred Orthodox music. However, he encountered problems with various institutions – the Imperial Chapel, the censorship authorities, as well as some conservative church officials who were more comfortable with smaller-calibre composers, since they could be manipulated if necessary. Tchaikovsky wished to reform sacred Orthodox music but at the same to draw inspiration from the traditions of past centuries. Prime example of this is Tchaikovsky’s monumental work in sacred Orthodox music, the Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom, Op. 41. The Nine Sacred Choruses, which date to 1884–1885, is not a cycle in the basic meaning of the word, but rather a collection, and another affirmation of Tchaikovsky’s skills as one of the greatest composers of Orthodox sacred music.

Now Osokins moves between the contrasting worlds of Chopin and Rachmaninov with the same unruffled authority as his seamless legato. As his first lengthy composition for piano, Rachmaninov’s set of Chopin Variations Op. 22 is a rare bird both in recital and on record, and rarer still in its complete form, as presented here. Osokins also takes the rare option, authorized by the composer, of playing the full theme both at the beginning and end of the Variations, lending to it a shape and coherence missing from several other, more storied versions. Indeed Osokins places himself in the distinguished tradition of Earl Wild and his forebears stretching back to Liszt, both in terms of his dazzling technical assurance and his repertoire, which encompasses original transcriptions as much as Romantic-era masterpieces. To follow the Variations he plays Wild’s version of ‘In the Silence of the Secret Night’ Op. 4 No. 3- a brooding, melancholy nocturne of a song- and a sensual take on ‘How Fair This Spot’ by Arcadi Volodos. Then there is Rachmaninov’s own, early Barcarolle, a rarely heard collection of Fragments (from 1917, the year of his exile to the US) and a version of the famous Vocalise which is the work of many hands, including Ososkins, who rounds off the album in the grand style with his own transcription of the ‘Nunc Dimittis’ from the Vespers.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=PCL10166&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Germany,2019 Piano Classics,2019 Piano Classics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But like his later works they are loaded with drama and big ideas. The first book in ‘On An Overgrown Path’ is notable for its poetic titles- such as ‘Our evenings,’ ‘They chattered like swallows,’ ‘Unutterable anguish’- which find expression in music of apparent folk-like innocence and sudden passions, which reach a powerful climax in the violent contrasts of the first book’s final piece, ‘The Barn-Owl has not flown away.’ This is music of heartbreak and desolation hardly less moving on its way than the great scenes of love and abandonment which Janacek composed for his operatic heroines. Stripped of such titles, the second book in ‘On An Overgrown Path’ is more elusive in meaning, swinging between a gentle, Czech translation of Debussy’s Impressionist tone-painting and darker, more sinister currents of expression that run raw and angry in the Sonata which Janacek wrote to commemorate the death of a young man at the hands of the police in Prague during political protests in the autumn of 1905. From seven years later, the four-movement cycle of Mists recovers some of the Romantic melancholy of ‘On an Overgrown Path,’ though its cathartic finale presents a stiff challenge to any pianist with its torrents of notes. As the recipient of a prestigious Borletti-Buitoni award, the Hungarian pianist Zoltan Fejervari is a solo, concerto and chamber-music pianist with several well-received recordings to his credit such as Liszt’s Malediction and an album of Mozart violin sonatas in partnership with Erno Kallai.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=PCL10176&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Germany,2019 Piano Classics,2019 Piano Classics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, he has frequently performed together with members of the Staatskapelle on the chamber music podium. At the 2013 Salzburg Easter Festival, for instance, he assumed the dual role of conductor and pianist.

Born in Seoul, Myung-Whun Chung began his career as a pianist. He started conducting as an assistant to Carlo Maria Giulini in Los Angeles. He has served as principal conductor at the Saarbrücken Radio Symphony Orchestra, the Opéra Bastille in Paris and the Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia in Rome; he was music director of the Orchestre Philharmonique de Radio France for 15 years. He continues to hold various offices in his native South Korea, including artistic director of the Seoul Philharmonic Orchestra and the Asia Philharmonic Orchestra, which brings together Asian musicians from the world’s major orchestras for concert projects.

Where other composers' work ends, Ahvenniemi only begins. Breath sounds, glottal stops, microphone static, white noise, electronic interferences, the percussive friction of instrument bows – these byproducts of music are the backbone of TACIT-CITAT-ION, yielding a truly unique auditory experience. Internationally educated and performed, Ahvenniemi exemplifies the new generation of musical tradition in the Nordic countries. Elements from previous musical epochs are eclectically drawn upon, such as romantic operatic singing in Dada-aria or the mix of classical and jazz elements in L'operette d’amour. Each of the works individually engages in reflecting the traditions of music and the surrounding society. The echoes of traditions are brought into the context of contemporary music through specific choices concerning scores, treatment of sound, and sound technology. Perhaps most importantly, there is a unique philosophy behind this music which is unfussy yet avantgarde – no minor feat by any means. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the album's eponymous track Tacit-Citat-ion, a post-modern composition for string quartet stylistically reminiscing about the ethereal qualities of composers such as Kaija Saariaho, Salvatore Sciarrino, Giacinto Scelsi, and Hans Abrahamsen. The title refers to the idea that no work appears outside of a historical context of musical codes. It is no wonder, then, that the Norwegian Composer’s Society willingly supported the creation of this album: with its prominent intellectual quality and uncompromising melange of stylistic elements, Ahvenniemi's compositions encompass the late-breaking zeitgeist of Nordic and contemporary European composition like few others.",https://youtu.be/9pv_esCJvDM,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=RR8011&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,,,2019 Ravello Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They were greatly influenced by folk music of different regions in Sweden, Norway and Finland. The Swedish violinist and violin pedagogue, Tor Aulin (1866-1914), was committed to the great romantic music tradition. In 1899, Aulin composed his “Four Watercolors” for violin (or cello) and piano. Also on the disc is the Sonata for violin and piano No. 1 in F Major by Edvard Grieg and following are four miniatures by the composer Jean Sibelius. On the voyage of discovery of traditional sounds of Nordic music, one arrives almost inevitably to Nordic folk music, which inspired the classical composers. Folk melodies are usually interpreted by a group of string instruments, or accompanied by guitar, flute and accordion, and are available today in collections according to the traditional mostly oral transmission. Fritz Froschhammer arranged these versions for violin and piano on this album in cooperation with the Duo Froschhammer in 2017. The Duo Froschhammer features siblings Felix Froschhammer (First Violinist of the casalQuartett and Concertmaster of both the Ensemble Symphonique Neuchâtel and Sinfonietta de Lausanne, Switzerland), violin, and Julia Froschhammer, piano. Founded in 1998, the Duo has since performed in Switzerland, Germany, Italy, France, Malta and at the famous Atheneum in Bucharest. Together they are prize winners of the International Wolfgang Jacobi Competition for 20th century chamber music and have been recipients of scholarships from the Bavarian Music Fund.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=SM314&medium=phy#,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Chamber Music,Austria,2019 Solo Musica,2019 Solo Musica GmbH,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

From the moment we put bow to string for Aaron’s Second Quartet, we realized his special voice and our connection to his music’s ability to capture both the complexity of the world and the simplicity of a moment. This depth fascinated us, inspired our playing and prompted us to dream of commissioning Aaron’s 3rd Quartet. Six years later, after performing and recording his first two Quartets and organizing the commission, we received the first movement of his Third Quartet “River”. As the movements accumulated in our inbox, so did our sense of excitement and dread. It was clear that this piece surpassed its two preceding quartets in complexity and difficulty. The route forward was clear enough, but still daunting. Practice, rehearse, repeat. Through the spring and into the summer the piece started to take shape. Coalescing first a little at a time - glimmers of cleverness, brilliance, atmosphere amid the musical and technical challenges. As those moments grew to sections and then movements that began to make sense, we started to build them into the larger arc. The quartet is subtitled “River”, an analogy for the constancy of change in our lives. The music too is constantly evolving, from moment to moment never predictable, never repeating itself. The flow of ideas isn’t one but four-dimensional, swirling constantly backward and forward in time and space. Yet there is a calculation of purpose, a consideration of form and care to structure that keeps the music grounded and allows a story to build out of the organic chaos...”",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=DSL-92233&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Chamber Music,United States,2019 Sono Luminus,2019 Sono Luminus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At the end of the 1820s, the stylistic canons of music had, already for some time, begun to change, giving way to new forms of artistic expression. The most important and prestigious models of Viennese classicism that had always been a point of reference for Sor had become absorbed into the glorious past of the Enlightenment. Not only this: his travels in Europe had allowed him to become acquainted with the most fashionable musicians of the time and, with them, the new musical trends that were sweeping through the Old Continent like a wave. The most influential name, the true and unanimously acclaimed star of the 1810s and ’20s, was Beethoven, who was then in the period of transition between his second and third style, in other words the most intensely romantic and formally complex phase of his career. And it was impossible for an attentive composer like Sor, who had heard his works in Paris and London, not to be struck by the work of the genius from Bonn. On this release, Sor’s works are performed by Stefano Grondona. Born in Genoa on 21st July 1958, Stefano Grondona distinguished himself very early as winner of the most prestigious international competitions, to the point that Andrés Segovia, in an interview from 1985, mentioned him as one of his four most significant pupils. John Williams, Oscar Ghiglia and Alirio Díaz, artists then at the height of their artistic maturity, were the others named by the Maestro. Grondona, who in 2014 celebrates the fortieth year of his concert career, has contributed with his interpretative and historical research to an innovative vision which is absolutely personal and also archetypal of the guitar.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=STR37129&medium=phy#,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Guitar,Italy,Milano Dischi,Milano Dischi,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He was closely familiar with the instrument, which served for him to share his innermost emotions and feelings. Janácek wrote his first opus, Thema con variazioni, at the age of 26, when he was studying at the Leipzig Conservatory. The miniature piece A Recollection is one of his last scores. The composer conceived his three essential piano works, 1.X. 1905, On an Overgrown Path and In the Mist, between 1900 and 1912, which was a difficult phase in his life. They are perhaps the most personal, most intimate pieces he wrote. Janácek was inspired by the sound of the cimbalom, an instrument he often heard when collecting folk songs in Moravia. The genes of the pianist Jan Bartoš evidently bear the traces of the ample musical tradition of his ancestors, including his grandfather, a cimbalom player. The legacy of folk music and the Silesian origin is what Janácek and Bartoš have in common. In his account of Janácek’s music, the pianist reveals a profound musicological insight, as well as a fascinating intuition – the inspiring integration of the heart and the brain, owing to which Bartoš’s previous Supraphon albums (Mozart – Concertos, SU 4234-2; Beethoven – Sonatas, SU 4252-2) have met with such great acclaim.

He studied there from 1950 to 1955, also studying the classical horn, which explains his almost supernatural breath control. After playing Tamino in a 1955 student production of W.A. Mozart's Die Zauberflöte, Fritz Wunderlich was engaged by the Wurttemberg State Opera in Stuttgart. His first professional role was as Ulrich Eislinger in Die Meistersinger. When he was called to play Tamino for an ailing Josef Traxel, Stuttgart had a new star and Fritz Wunderlich's short but amazing career had begun.

The recording was the very first one of the original version of Rossini’s Petite Messe solennelle, realized using the critical new edition based on Rossini’s autograph score published in 1991 by Carus. Gioachino Rossini's Petite messe solennelle (Little solemn mass) was written in 1863, possibly at the request of Count Alexis Pillet-Will for his wife Louise to whom it is dedicated. The composer, who had retired from composing operas more than 30 years before, described it as ""the last of my péchés de vieillesse"" (sins of old age). The extended work is a missa solemnis, but Rossini labeled it, not without irony, petite (little). He scored it originally for twelve singers, four of them soloists, two pianos and harmonium. The mass was first performed on 14 March 1864 at the couple's new home in Paris. Rossini later produced an orchestral version, including an additional movement, a setting of the hymn ""O salutaris hostia"" as a soprano aria. This version of the mass was not performed during his lifetime because he could not obtain permission to perform it with female singers in a church. It was first performed three months after his death, at the Salle Ventadour in Paris by the company of the Théâtre-Italien on 24 February 1869.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=SWR19521CD&medium=phy#,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Choral,Germany,1995 SWR Media Services GmbH,2019 Naxos Germany GmbH,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although he studied classical piano as a child, he enjoyed playing anything he heard on the radio. In high school and his first years of college he attended the Manhattan School of Music as a classical piano major. His natural instinct for improvisation led Kenny to the Berklee School of Music in 1970. There he sought tutelage of the renowned piano teacher Madame Chaloff. Her gracious wisdom and inspiration became a driving force in Kenny’s conception: A music conscious of its spiritual intent and essence. From Boston, Kenny traveled to Brazil with the saxophonist Victor Assis Brasil. There he met Victor’s twin brother, Brazilian pianist Joao Assis Brasil. He studied with Joao, who provided another piece of the puzzle for Kenny’s conception that would lead to Effortless Mastery, his landmark opus on how to allow the master musician from within to manifest.

2019,Yarlung Records,YAR78677,193428786776,Traditional spirituals ,Lifeline Quartet: Lifeline - Music of the Underground Railroad,Lifeline Quartet,1,CD,15.59,23.99,"Michelle Mayne-Graves and her Lifeline Quartet perform spirituals from the Civil War and earlier celebrating code songs for the Underground Railroad. These spirituals include hidden messages about maps, navigational strategies and timing for slaves to escape toward freedom in the Northern States and Canada. ""Wade in the Water"" serves as a reminder of where to walk in the rivers to make it harder for dogs to scent people escaping at night. ""I'm On My Way to Canaan's Land"" talks about the route to Canada. Harriet Tubman is one of the better known heroes who escaped slavery herself and then worked as a ""conductor"" on the Underground Railroad, helping subsequent groups of people flee to the North. In addition to directing choirs, performing spirituals and helping to coordinate and lead veterans singing groups, Michelle supervises a team and works as a nurse assisting homeless veterans at the Veteran's Administration in Los Angeles. For Lifeline's debut album we chose ""If I can Help Somebody"" to be our opening track. This song not only honors Harriet Tubman, but reveals Michelle's generous heart as well. Michelle lives what she sings.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-ioYz8428A&feature=youtu.be,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=YAR78677&medium=phy#,24 Pop,Vocal,Vocal,United States,2019,2019,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In 2017 they teamed up with bassist Sven Faller to start a real collaboration. The chemistry of this trio turned out to be just right and lead to a number of well-received concerts. After successfully continuing their tour in 2018 they decided it was time to document their efforts in a recording. They named it after one of their favorite compositions by European jazz pioneer Django Reinhardt: “Manoir de mes Rêves“. A lot of the group’s repertoire is based on material originating from Paris in the 50’s and 60’s - compositions, that Philip Catherine was fond of when he was a young man – like “Les Amoureux des Bancs Publics“ by Georges Brassens. “Pas Encore” was composed by Henri Salvador and is based on lyrics by Boris Vian. Salvador, who briefly played in Django Reinhardt’s group was a major force in French music. Reinhardt himself is represented not only by the title track but also by his composition “Swing 39“ and the jazz standards “Insensiblement“ and “I’ll See You in my Dreams“ that rank among his signature tunes. “Jardin d’Hiver“ is by French jazz organ great Eddy Louiss. Also from the 60’s is the famous Bossa Nova “Recado“, that proves to be a perfect vehicle for the trio’s strengths. Newer material include two songs associated with Belgian singer Maurane: “Les Uns contre les Autres“ (written by France Gall’s husband Michel Berger) which Philip played after her recent death. “Enfant des Etoiles“ was written for Maurane by Philip’s Belgian friend Evert Verhees. One of the highlights of the album is piano player Nicola Andrioli`s composition “To Philip“.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=ENJ-9768&medium=phy#,02 Jazz,Jazz,,Germany,2019,2019 werner aldinger,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It’s the only band from Germany that recently received a whole page in the American Downbeat, the most famous Jazz magazine in the world. “Trio Elf continues its signature exploration of the best of what’s out there in the world of sound“ Downbeat. On their Brazilian Album they feature Maria Gadu, Mariene de Castro, Virginia Rdorigues, Margaret Menezes, Jussara Silveira on vocals. Trio Elf has truly re-invented the classic jazz piano trio in recent years by using grooves and sounds of contemporary club styles as a kickoff for improvisation. Their warm acoustic sound is augmented by the creative use of electronics. Trio Elf's musical ease stems from melodies of an almost hymnic quality, dazzling rhythms und surprising dynamic shifts arising from a collective breathing of three equal voices. Critics both in Europe and Japan have hailed their inspired interplay “Trio Elf is part of a new German jazz generation. They are unearthing what once has made jazz so great: Risk, new sounds and bursts of energy“ Hamburger Abendblatt Gerwin Eisenhauer's virtuoso drumming sounds like a drum machine come alive. He freely improvises with drum'n'bass or hip-hop grooves like any legend of jazz drumming would do with the swing rhythm. Walter Lang is one of Europe's most prestigious pianists and a celebrated star in Japan. His lyrically expressive melodies and energetic chords testify to his enormous musical versatility and creative spark. Peter Cudek is internationally acclaimed for his unique virtuoso style on the acoustic bass. He effortlessly and instantly shifts from melodious counterpoint to deep synth-like grooves in the low register.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=YEB-7787&medium=phy#,11 Latin,Brazilian,Jazz,Germany,werner aldinger,werner aldinger,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2019,Yellowbird,YEB-7792,767522779226,"Or Bareket; Nitai Hershkovits; Ernesto ""Cuchi"" Leguizamon; Manuel Castilla; Hamilton De Hollanda",Or Bareket: 33,Or Bareket; Nitai Hershkovits; Shachar Elantan; Daniel Dor; Camila Meza; Eden Bareket,1,CD,14.81,22.99,"One of the most prominent bassists of his generation, Or Bareket has been in constant demand since moving to NYC nearly a decade ago. His rhythmic dexterity, fluent lyricism, propulsive beat, and compelling sound have made him a sought-after collaborator on the NY and global jazz scenes. Developing as a composer and leading his own bands was a natural evolution. Over the past few years Bareket has been carefully forging a cohesive, personal aesthetic that draws from his ancestral folklores, his lifelong study of Jazz and western classical music, and the influences of his peers, mentors, and collaborators. “33” is the sequel to “ob1”, Bareket’s well-received 2017 debut as a leader, and it goes farther and deeper than its predecessor in multiple directions. Nate Chinen of WBGO jazz referred to the previous album as ""...music of rhythmic sophistication and lyrical depth...brimming with springy energies and smart details."" “33” continues on the same artistic path with elaborate, detailed, and intricate compositions, but adds more layers of nuance and a wider emotional spectrum. The richness and complexity of tracks like “Still searching” or “Vienna” is contrasted by the intimacy and patience of “Zamba De Argamonte” - a duo interpretation for an Argentinian classic with Camila Meza on vocals. Various analog synthesizers like the Optigan “invade” the album at different moments, creating new soundscapes and dimensions on tracks like “Feb 1st” and the title track “Thirty Three”. “This album is a meditation on life-cycles, transformations, the death and (re)birth of ideas, relationships, and people.. These melodies and rhythms were born as chants, as medicines, a compass, an anchor during a time of dramatic shifts in my life: endings and beginnings, grief and ecstasy, communion and isolation, wanderlust and homesickness.”",https://youtu.be/2b_Ot8Qtt_4,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=YEB-7792&medium=phy#,02 Jazz,Jazz,,United States,2019,2019 yellowbird records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
