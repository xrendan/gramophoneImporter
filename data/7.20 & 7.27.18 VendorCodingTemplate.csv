Taking a transcription of the Prelude from Tristan (in a concert version arranged by the composer) as point of departure, the pieces illustrate the influence of Wagner on German and French composers from the mid-nineteenth century to the early twentieth. This musical concept also goes to justify the particular choice of instrument, since the organ used for the recording is well suited to both the ‘Germanic’ world and the more hedonistic French spirit. The interpretations (which take into account historical, analytical and aesthetic considerations) therefore also benefit from the hybrid nature of this instrument: built by Dalstein & Haerpfer and reconstructed by Manufacture d’Orgues Thomas, it represents a successful synthesis of the two sound worlds. It is therefore able to do equal justice to both Liszt and Franck, and to create a coherent and captivating symphonic context for the chosen transcriptions.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Release.aspx?id=AE11141,01 Classical,Classical,,Germany,2018 Aeolus,2018 Aeolus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As an orphan who had been obliged to learn everything by himself, he retained the deep-rooted urge to teach and pass on his knowledge. His cantatas are spiritual lessons, just as his keyboard works constitute a tutor in the instrument. It was with his children, first and foremost, that he exercised this talent as a born teacher, and particularly with his prodigiously gifted eldest son, Wilhelm Friedemann. For him he wrote the Two-part Inventions and Three-part Sinfonias; for him too The Well-Tempered Clavier and the Orgel-Buchlein (Little organ book); and this extraordinary method culminated in the Trio Sonatas for organ. The cantata Geist und Seele wird verwirret (Spirit and soul are dumbfounded) BWV 35 is one of the three written for solo alto without choral participation and with reduced instrumental forces. The work comprises two parts, for performance before and after the sermon. Soloist and organ engage in a dialogue charged with the elation of trust in God, brimming with coloratura passages and runs. Also for alto solo, the cantata Vergnugte Ruh, beliebte Seelenlust (Contented repose, beloved heart’s desire) BWV 170 dates from just six weeks before Geist und Seele. It too features a solo organ part, later transcribed by Bach for flute and continuo.

As the prevailing Calvinist atmosphere at the court prevented Bach from writing religious music, he turned exclusively to instrumental music at this time. But the Prince’s chamber did not occupy all of Bach’s time. In Cothen he was officially discharged from any ad horam obligations to the church, and was thus able to devote part of his time to teaching. His two Clavier-Buchlein, written for Wilhelm Friedemann and Anna Magdalena Bach, respectively, bear witness to this activity. The English Suites are, above all, suites. Their movements include the prelude, the allemande, the courante, the sarabande, and the gigue. Bourrees, gavottes, minuets, and passepieds appear between the sarabande and the gigue.

Bach: Symphonies & Cello Concerto,Cafe Zimmermann,1,CD,7.79,11.99,"In Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach’s catalogue, the music for solo keyboard and the chamber music occupy central positions. In his youth, Carl Philipp Emanuel, who was left-handed, did not play string instruments such as the violin or viola, but rather the harpsichord and organ (not to overlook the flute). It was as a harpsichordist that, in 1738, he joined the entourage of the future King of Prussia, Frederick II, before following him to Berlin upon his accession two years later and then formally entering his service. In 1767, he was offered the succession of his godfather, Telemann, as director of music in Hamburg. He arrived in the Hanseatic city in March 1768, and for the last twenty years of his life, it was church music that occupied much of his time and effort. The symphonies of Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach are all in three movements, quite often linked without a break. Highly original and typical of north Germany, the symphonies turn their back on the style gallant, on Johann Stamitz, founder of the Mannheim School, and on the Viennese style. The Concerto in A major was originally written for harpsichord and strings, bur was later transcribed for cello by the composer, likely for the cellist Christian Friedrich Schale, who hosted a Musikalische Assemblee in his Berlin home every week.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Release.aspx?id=ALPHA345,01 Classical,Classical,,Netherlands,Alpha 2006,Alpha Classics / Outhere Music France 2018,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Berlin court of Frederick II was in fact governed by two flautists: the king himself, and his teacher and accredited and exclusive composer, the famous Johann Joachim Quantz. His five flute concertos were derived from a group of seven concertos for harpsichord written between 1747 and 1755. It is very likely that Emanuel Bach himself made all these transcriptions. The versions for flute nearly always date from the same year as the corresponding harpsichord concerto, which suggests virtually simultaneous conceptions.

In attempting to revive in part the musical world of Sir Francis Tregian, our aim was to explore the elements of dream and travel through time and space.

She came to the throne on the death of Mary Tudor, in 1558; Byrd was then not yet twenty. And her long reign ended forty-five years later, in 1603. Byrd was thus the Elizabethan composer par excellence, occupying the same role as his younger contemporary Shakespeare played in the theatre. Though he spent his whole life in the service of the Anglican Church, Byrd was born and remained a Roman Catholic. His prestige must have been considerable, for the Queen continued to protect him and he was never harassed during the religious disputes that shook the country. When he became organist of Lincoln Cathedral in 1563, barely into his twenties, his professional qualities were recognized by a salary considerably higher than was customary. Byrd very quickly established himself as an outstanding personality, thanks to his performing skill on keyboard instruments, his burgeoning reputation as a composer and his charisma with both colleagues and pupils.

His Marian works comprise liturgical pieces sung during the Mass or the Office, but also religious motets written to new poems. It was probably during his first period in the chapel of the dukes of Savoy that Dufay produced a complete cycle of polyphonic hymns for the Office of Vespers of the principal feasts. Their interpretation obeys the principle of alternatim chant, that is to say alternation between monophonic odd-numbered verses, sung in plainchant, and even-numbered polyphonic verses. Dufay employs here the techniques of composition already in use in the fourteenth century. The liturgical melody is sung in the highest voice but appears transformed according to the principles of paraphrase: the composer’s inventive contribution, in this context, resides in the flexibility of the mensuration (often ternary) and the grace of his ornamentation. The other two, lower voices accompany it in a virtually homophonic style. The influence of the improvisatory practice known as ‘fauxbourdon’ is manifest. In its simple form, the melody of the cantus is doubled by the tenor and the contratenor, respectively a sixth and a fourth lower.

The Lecons de Tenebres of 1680, now lost, probably provided material for the Tenebrae compositions that have come down to us. Although Lalande had written his Lecons and his Miserere for solo voice for the nuns of the convent of the Assumption, they were actually sung- like many of his works for female voices- by his daughters. The Lecons de Tenebres and Miserere must have therefore been composed some time before 1711, for that year Jeanne and Marie Anne de Lalande died in the smallpox epidemic. For this interpretation of the Miserere, the musicians have chosen the version presented in Brossard’s autograph manuscript of 1711, in which the alternate verses are sung by three voices in faux-bourdon, a practice that was still in vogue at that time in France.

Like most cathedrals of Western Europe, Reims is built on the site of an earlier edifice. The Rouelle altar, on the left in the nave, adjacent to the choir screen, was dedicated to the Holy Spirit. But in 1343 a magnificent statue of the Virgin Mary was placed there. In 1341 Archbishop Jean de Vienne established a plainchant Votive Mass for the Virgin, to be performed each week before the Rouelle altar. The Marian Mass was introduced by Guillaume de Machaut and his younger brother Jean as a perpetuation of the archbishop’s wish, and it was for that particular liturgy, which was sung every Saturday throughout the year, that Guillaume wrote his famous polyphonic mass. The Messe de Nostre Dame, as it is called in only one of the five surviving manuscripts, is the first complete preserved polyphonic mass known to be by a single hand. It includes the five movements of the Ordinary plus the four-voice Ite missa est. The Mass is not strictly speaking a unified cycle, but there is nevertheless great coherence in its rhythmic and harmonic languages.

He was thirty-two and living in Vienna, a city which had offered him numerous opportunities in the past. Musically, it had provided a platform combining excellent musicians and enthusiastic audiences. In more personal terms, it was the place where he had freed himself from the emotional pressure exerted by his father Leopold and his former employer, the Archbishop of Salzburg. However, Viennese audiences were no longer interested in his masterful modernist compositions. When Mozart composed these, his last three symphonies, he was thought of as a ‘dissonance hunter.’ In this symphonic ‘trilogy,’ Mozart illuminates all aspects of human expression, quite independently of his personal situation. Each work presents a different character. No. 39 in E flat major contains numerous elements reminiscent of chamber music, while no. 40 in G minor makes clear references to opera. No. 41 in C major includes formal elements from Baroque music (overture, concerto, fugue).

However, there does exist a declared model for the music of Tartini, at least for a certain period: that of Corelli. His output seems dominated initially by the influence of his great predecessor in terms of both language and structure. The reference to folk music in his music is also obvious. Another interesting element in the sonatas presented on this release is the presence of mottoes of varying length placed next to the incipits of certain movements, and often written in a ciphered cuneiform alphabet invented by the composer. These are poetic quotations, mostly drawn from the works of Metastasio, although not all of them have been identified. At the end of this recording is one of Tartini’s very rare vocal pieces, the last composition copied into MS 1888/1.

Aware of that keen interest, the publisher Michel Le Cene decided in 1729 to present his customers with the very first collection of concertos for flute and orchestra. Vivaldi responded to his request by refurbishing several older works. Only one of them was already in the modern concerto form: the Concerto in F major for recorder and strings. Another four pieces were hybrid in form and still close to chamber works. The predominant role of the recorder or flute in those four concertos made them ideal for adaptation. The odd man out of the collection is the short Concerto in G major RV 435. No earlier version is known and its style, more modern than its five companions in the set, leads us to suppose that Vivaldi wrote it specifically for Le Cene’s publication. The decade following the publication of op. 10 saw the appearance of a fair number of new flute concertos. Among them, the Concerto in A minor RV 440 is a splendid example of Vivaldi’s maturity. Studying the manuscript of this concerto reveals different stages in its composition, as well as shedding light on its destination. In the case of RV 438 and RV 400, Vivaldi simplified many passages, probably making such sacrifices for a flautist of very limited virtuosity.

While his early piano pieces were still linked to Scriabin's late work, the composer soon developed completely new forms of musical discourse, including graphic notation. Christian Erny assembled a roughly hour-long selection of works that offer a foray into the innovative and fascinating world of Arthur Lourie. Christian Erny (b. 1988) is a young musician of high versatility. He is an active pianist and piano pedagogue as well as founder and conductor of the vocal ensemble The Zurich Chamber Singers.

The title of the recording, Mas alla del sueno or Beyond the Dream, underlines the duo’s intention to always think ahead with regards to musical development, to seek inspiration in the future and to remain open to new ideas and dreams. Duo Accordarra met while studying toward their Masters degrees at the University of Music and Dance in Cologne, Germany. The two highly accomplished soloists share similar musical tastes and a vigorous and passionate technique.

Yet there are also standard march rhythms, jubilant choruses, wedding hymns and festive dances. The score follows a pattern similar to Donizetti's other works in the opera seria genre: sentiments are expressed with a cavatina or a cabaletta and duets taken at breakneck speed contrast with grandiose concertato numbers with melody lines even catchier than in the composer's other works, perhaps in an unconscious effort to offset the shocking subject matter.

They also show the influence of the contrapuntal writing which had been his daily bread when he was hard at his craft as an apprentice composer.

Born to an Italian father in Nice in 1905, Bozza studied violin and piano in Rome as a child before winning a place at the Paris Conservatoire, where he excelled on the violin. It was in France that he made his career, initially as an orchestra leader, conductor and composer. In 1931 he won the prestigious Prix de Rome and he was later decorated by the Republic as a Chevalier of the Legion d’Honneur for his services to French music. Having become director of the conservatoire in Valenciennes at the age of 45, he wrote prolifically for chamber ensembles, producing the kind of music which students could study and play together. However, his style was not an academic one, nor was it especially influenced by the artistic upheavals of the century in which he lived. Image is the earliest work here, dating from 1939 and sharing with later studies a full understanding of the instrument’s technical possibilities. There are many allusions in the 14 etudes-Arabesques (1960) to famous flute solos of the past as composed by the likes of Mendelssohn, Debussy and Ravel, as well as demanding tests of flutter-tonguing and other flute techniques. The 10 Studies in Karnatic Modes (1972) are much more experimental and modernist, including sparing use of quarter-tones, and employing Indian modes such as may be discovered in some of Debussy’s music. The technical challenges include wide leaps, frequent dynamic changes and extremely high flute-writing.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=BRI95434&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Germany,2018 Brilliant Classics,2018 Brilliant Classics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He wrote several orchestral and chamber works, songs and salon pieces, but his best and most-recorded work is this Clarinet Trio, published in 1925 but cast in an idiom at least a generation before its composition. Born in 1868, and dying in reduced circumstances in 1937 after the Crash had left him in need, he was and remained a musical Romantic, whose language is perfectly fitted to this most Brahmsian of genres. From that earlier generation, Zemlinsky’s 1896 Trio surges with D minor expression and passion. He wrote it as a 25-year-old for a Viennese chamber-music competition. While the syntax and mood certainly echo Brahms, the chromatic harmony is the composer’s own: so too the intense songfulness which surges through the long opening movement and then a central, richly textured Andante. Even the brief finale is restless and filled with agitated, virtuoso writing for the piano in particular, while the clarinet sings a troubled descant line. Clarinet music by Zemlinsky’s contemporaries, Busoni and Hindemith, has been the subject of previous Brilliant Classics albums by the clarinettist Davide Bandieri. According to MusicWeb International, reviewing the Hindemith collection, he has ‘an attractive woody tone and fine phrasing and articulation.’ He is joined here by Joel and Marja-Liisa Marosi, husband and wife, who teach and perform in Switzerland.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=BRI95394&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Germany,2018 Brilliant Classics,2018 Brilliant Classics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This recording is the first edition to include all existing organ and harpsichord compositions by Lubeck as well as a series of previously unknown manuscript pieces. Despite Lubeck’s fame during his long lifetime, few of his organ works are well known, yet his pieces for organ are the most important in his oeuvre. Influenced by Buxtehude and Reincken, Lubeck composed works that were both technically and artistically elaborate with frequent two-pedal virtuosic passages, five voices and other compositional elements rarely used by most of his contemporaries. Lubeck’s Clavier Uebung, written in 1728, consists of a single suite for harpsichord, with the traditional dances (Allemande, Courante, Sarabande and Gigue) preceded by a prelude and fugue and followed by a chaconne. The S.M.G. manuscript from 1691 includes 45 short pieces for keyboard, many anonymous although five are attributed to Lubeck’s father, and it also contains the only known compositions by Lubeck’s son. These pedagogical pieces work well on a small historic harpsichord or clavichord, or on a small or regal stop organ. In fact, the dynamic markings in certain pieces indicate clavichord, considered to be the preferred instrument on which to learn keyboard technique.

Sanz’s music reveals him to have been a key figure in bridging two different musical traditions – the Spanish and the Italian. We know from his own testimony that music from outside Spain was being performed in Zaragoza in his lifetime, and the cultural influence of Austria, with its leanings for the Italian style, would also have been felt in the city at that time. His book, at once a collection of music and a method, was addressed to both aficionados and beginners, as well as professional musicians. It contains practical and innovative advice on harmony, counterpoint and continuo practice for accompanying soloists and dancers, his vast musical knowledge and creativity demonstrated in numerous original compositions and national and foreign songs. Having travelled the continent extensively, much of his musical education took place in Italy, and he would have encountered these songs and dances there in instrumental versions. Italian classical guitarist Alberto Mesirca was hailed as ‘prodigiously talented’ in Classical Guitar Magazine, and Kenneth Keaton of American Record Guide praised his album Scarlatti Sonatas as ‘the best Scarlatti I’ve heard on solo guitar’. He is a two-time winner of the “Golden Guitar” Award: for Best Recording in 2007 and as Best Upcoming Artist of the Year in 2009. With this release, he has recorded all of Sanz’s punteado (plucked) music for guitar, together with the corresponding rasgueado (strummed) parts or dances.

The surviving body of Correa’s work, the Facultad organica, was published in 1626. For its time it remains a remarkably forward-looking collection. It is especially notable for the dissonant harmonies which Correa, as a cleric as well as a composer, aimed to evoke for his listeners the hardships facing them on their path towards a longed-for paradise. Francesco Cera has made an album of highlights from the Facultad organica. The original volume opened with a collection of tientos, organised as a collection following the 12 modern modes – an exceptional practice in Spanish keyboard music. The first tiento was a calling-card for Correa, revealing his skill at counterpoint by employing thematic inversion and experimenting with different types of imitative technique. Interleaved with the dance-like, freely elaborated tientos are the glosas, which exploit still more virtuosic possibilities of rhythm and color – Correa himself was evidently a distinguished performer. The result is a collection of still little-known yet dazzling music that will attract the attention of all organ-music enthusiasts. Francesco Cera has made significant contributions to the Brilliant Classics library of 17th-century keyboard music. Among them are albums dedicated to d’Anglebert and an imaginative compilation of Gabrieli, Cabezon and Frescobaldi, ‘The Organ at European Courts’.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=BRI95508&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Germany,2018 Brilliant Classics,2018 Brilliant Classics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These are only some of the most significant composers whose work he has recorded for Brilliant Classics in building a library on record of minimalist piano music. Simplicity, repetition and appealing melody are the qualities shared by all the composers who subscribe to this aesthetic, and they underlie van Veen’s own compositions. Although subtitled Volume 2, this is the third album to focus exclusively on the pianist as composer. Books 1 and 2 of his Minimal Piano Preludes were reissued in 2016, and won high praise from MusicWeb International. Further preludes feature in a release of his piano music, and this sequel takes us up to Minimal Prelude No.60, a ‘tango for organ’.  “All my music is about time and space,” says van Veen. “The duration of music is an essential part of the concept in my music. The concept of music, specifically my minimal oriented music, only can exist in time. The slow progression, building of the material, the motifs and the search for new sounds is audible in this [album].” All the works featured here were composed between 2010 and 2018. Continuum is a concertante work for piano and flute octet. Incanto is another album-length piece, entirely composed in an unusual 11/8 time signature. Ripalmania is written for six pianos, a scoring which creates an entrancing effect. In Velvet Piano van Veen explores the timbral possibilities of pianos prepared with objects after the style of John Cage, though without the American composer’s aim of disconcerting the listener.

Almost equally famous, however, is the historical oddity that its sublime conclusion is almost certainly not his work. Sung as Nero and his new wife drift off in amoral bliss, ‘Pur ti miro’ has been attributed to various of Monteverdi’s Venetian contemporaries. However, among the most plausible candidates is Filiberto Laurenzi. Very little is known of his life except for his encounter with the soprano Anna Renzi, considered the first diva in the history of opera. She not only studied under Laurenzi, but also let him manage her career, following him when he left Rome for Venice. The duet is featured here alongside excerpts from an entertainment conceived when the genre of opera was still in its infancy. Like Poppea, La finta savia was first performed during the 1643 Venetian carnival season. It may be counted an early example of the pasticcio genre, in which a dramatic piece is the work of several hands, among them in this case Leardini, Pozzi, Ferrari, Giovan Battista Crivelli and Tarquinio Merula alongside Laurenzi. This recording includes five virtuoso arias making use of dance rhythms, some of them intimate in atmosphere and others that are more brilliant, such as ‘Tant’armi inventate’. These operatic excerpts are complemented by arias from a 1641 collection dedicated to Laurenzi’s work. The highlight is probably ‘Così mi lasci ingrato’, a deeply affecting lament for lost love on words by Ottaviano Castelli.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=BRI95685,01 Classical,Classical,,Germany,2018 Brilliant Classics,2018 Brilliant Classics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As a principal flautist in the major opera orchestras of Italy and across Europe, Briccialdi attracted renown not only for his performing virtuosity but also his ability to exploit and stimulate the rapid technical evolution of his instrument. Although he wrote an opera and a symphony, his legacy as a composer rests upon his works for his own instrument. These include many chamber works for flute and piano: fantasias and operatic fantasias capitalizing on the popular success of dramatic works, especially by Verdi. There are several attractive wind quintets and the Carnevale di Venezia Op.78, a concertante work for flute and orchestra, which has been recorded several times. These four concertos represent some of Briccialdi’s most valuable and original works: conceived as a pinnacle of virtuosic display for the soloist’s skill, and based entirely on original material, Briccialdi mostly kept those works for his personal use. In fact the great majority of Briccialdi’s work remains unpublished and the scores of these concertos were only published earlier this year by the Italian firm of Ricordi.

The salterio enjoyed great popularity in aristocratic circles in 18th century Italy and was heard in church, at the theatre and at court. In spite of its noble past, the Italian salterio today is almost unknown. But hundreds of compositions for virtuosos and laymen demonstrate the interest of the upper classes in this instrument. The composer’s names of this selection are nearly all totally unknown, but their music is composed fresh and inventive in the upcoming Rococo style. The playing practice is based on research by Franziska Fleischanderl on the Italian salterio in the 18th century: owing to its construction, the salterio allows for two completely different playing techniques which were both used equally. The strings can either be plucked (pizzicato) or struck with two mallets (battuto).

These include the concept of marrying for love, in which the partners choose each other; the ideal of monogamy and fidelity; and many other longings that are not easily resolved and that therefore often draw people into complex situations where love and madness are sometimes uncomfortably close together. The artist, as a kind of seismologist of social wellbeing, has always been afforded a special position. His feelings were deemed more passionate. The lives and works of composers Hector Berlioz and Richard Wagner back up this assertion. As a man and artist, Richard Wagner was a passionate, valiant and controversial contemporary. In Tannhauser und der Sangerkrieg auf der Wartburg, right at the outset of his career, he composed a romantic opera about precisely this fraught zone between artist and society, and about the conflict of instinctive emotions, as his protagonist experiences in excess in Venusberg, with the pure, selfless love of Elisabeth. The real title of Berlioz’s Symphonie fantastique is “Episode in the Life of an Artist.” The classification of Symphonie fantastique was to be understood as a subtitle, meant to indicate that something completely new, and indeed fantastic, would transpire here with the form of the symphony- a truly groundbreaking, unique work in music history.",https://www.hd-klassik.com/sinfonieorchester-wuppertal-live-vol-2,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Release.aspx?id=Cybele SACD 3D-801801,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Orchestral,Germany,2018 Cybele Records,2018 Cybele Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Carlotta Ferrari (b.1975) has composed numerous pieces inspired by historical figures as well as pieces inspired by literature and works of art. Several of these directions are brought together in the five compositions on this album, which celebrate three religious figures, an artist, and a writer. In Ferrari’s distinctive modal style, she creates expressive musical portraits of these women. The first four works on this album all employ the “Restarting Pitch Space” (RPS) system of modal harmony. First developed by Carson Cooman in 2005, Carlotta Ferrari has worked extensively with this system in many compositions written since 2016. Carson Cooman (b.1982) is an American composer with a catalog of hundreds of works in many forms—ranging from solo instrumental pieces to operas, and from orchestral works to hymn tunes. His music has been performed on all six inhabited continents. As an active concert organist, Cooman specializes in the performance of contemporary music.

During the 14th to 17th centuries, the shawm – a double-reed wind instrument – was widely used. Performing together with the cornett, oboe and trombone, the Middle Ages and Renaissance are its musical home. Town piper ensembles as well as representative and sacred music determined its world of sound. On the other hand, for about 50 years the accordion – an aerophone of the 19th century – has been evolving into a concert instrument on the classical concert podium. Many contemporary composers write music for it and have learned to love its tonal aesthetic. What can a combination of such very different instruments achieve and reveal today? Margit Kern and Katharina Bäuml were convinced from the beginning that it would have to be more than merely an experiment. A new beginning, a journey with an unknown destination. The present recording involves nothing less than an encounter between different historical periods and musical cultures; it really is more than merely a tonal experiment.

La Colombina is a vocal ensemble specializing in music from the Renaissance and the early Baroque eras. The group was founded in 1990 by four vocalists who also boast extraordinary solo careers- coprano Maria Cristina Kiehr, alto Claudio Cavina, tenor Josep Benet, and baritone Josep Cabre. The group’s repertoire largely consists of music by Spanish composers, with the occasional foray into Italian or French music.

The repertoire of Russian organ music is understandably smaller than many other countries because the instrument is not included in Orthodox liturgies. However, Tchaikovsky and Prokofiev attended the organ classes at the St. Petersburg conservatory and there are many concert halls with organs. The Passacaglia heard on this release by Shostakovich was written to be performed at the end of the fourth scene of the second act of the opera Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District. When considering the many sonatas of Paul Hindemith, it is with considerable joy that three very different works should have been written for the organ. The sonata included on this release was written in 1940 while the composer was teaching at the University of Buffalo. The organ works of Arvo Part heard on this recording draw on his well-known technique of tintinnabulation, whereby a triad is heard in different inversions against a generally conjunct line that in turn creates consonant and dissonant intervals. Finally, Anton Heiller’s Tanz-Toccata has remained the most frequently performed of his many organ works, for understandable reasons. It is a piece that is not easily mirrored in the repertoire.

He has also been an active composer. So it is high time he came center stage and we had a chance to hear his own chamber music. Flux and Fire features Gibson’s works for stringed instruments that were inspired by poetry. The fluid boundary between music and poetry as art- and to specific poems as inspiration for instrumental music- is a deeply personal one for the composer and is a defining characteristic of much of his music. Some of the poets he draws from include Alain Bosquet, Stanley Kunitz, and Paul Muldoon, while the listener may discern allusions to the music of Debussy and Takemitsu. The title of the double bass quartet Soundings is a reference in part to the nautical term for measuring the depth of water. This term has an obvious connection to the double bass as the “deepest” sounding string instrument of the orchestra. As a professional bassist, the composer notes that this work is “a personal exploration of the instrument that is closest to me in my life as a musician.” This recording showcases four members of the National Symphony. Two string quartets are the chronological bookends of this project. The quartets are framed in the album by three versions of Night Music, a solo work commissioned for the Third Triennial Johansen International Competition for Young String Players (2003) and written so that the work is suitable for performance on violin, viola, or cello without any instrument specific editing.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=INN993,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Chamber Music,,,2018 Robert Gibson,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recorded by the Berliner Blockfloten Orchester, ‘Alla Turca’ makes audible not only the musical diversity of such Western representations of the Orient, but also the manifold timbral facets of the recorder. Well-known works such as Mozart’s ‘Rondo alla Turca’ stand alongside unfamiliar gems. Resplendent marches are contrasted with gentle Oriental idylls. Contemporary depictions are juxtaposed with Baroque perspectives. On their journey to the Orient, listeners encounter Jean-Baptiste Lully, Giuseppe Verdi, and Gioachino Rossini, as well as Julius Weissenborn, Ernest Richard Kroeger, and Reynaldo Hahn. Soren Sieg’s commissioned work ‘Jabal Ram’ deserves special mention amongst this colourful company: it is the disc’s only piece that was written for a recorder orchestra. All other compositions were originally written for piano, organ, or even the bassoon, or formed part of stage works. With meticulous care, Simon Borutzki has arranged these works for recorders. His bespoke arrangements enable the Berliner Blockfloten Orchester to present the diversity of recorder music to full effect — ranging from soft heights to unexpectedly warm depths. The orchestra’s sound is enriched by percussionist Nora Thiele.

Totally abstract in form and concept, though inspired by a principle (here, the particle entanglement in Quantum Mechanics), the pieces, especially ‘low-order’ where the score is more prescribed, can take on the appearance of other forms such as baroque fugue, romantic prelude or even soft jazz. Moreover the music is hardly ever ‘challenging’ for the listener, with quasi-tonal, melodic flow. In many ways Craven is laying down a new direction for piano composition.

The performer creates his own performance by choosing which pages to play and in which order; pages can also be omitted. Cage began by choosing, using chance operations, a way of composing based on either his Music for Piano series – single notes, or on Winter Music – chords, or aggregates of notes. Chance operations would also determine whether a variation on one of these two types would be used or whether something completely new, with its own subsequent variations, would be written. When Cage wrote the Two Pieces for Piano (1935), he was already studying with Arnold Schoenberg. Schoenberg’s influence on Cage undoubtedly accounts for the music’s 12-tone-row-based organization, but Cage’s own version of this system had the twelve note series broken down into short pitch/rhythm cells. Later Cage began a study of Indian philosophy and came to believe that the purpose of music is “to imitate nature in its manner of operation” and “to sober and quiet the mind thus rendering it susceptible to divine influences.” These principles underlie another set of piano pieces that Cage wrote in the months May to August, 1946, entitled again, Two Pieces for Piano (1946). These later pieces are more extensively worked out and possess a sense of urgency and heightened drama, brought about in the first piece by long silences and in the second by a quicker flow and variety of musical events distributed over a greater range of the instrument. The silences heard in the first piece are an early example of what later became a pillar of Cage’s thought and music — the primacy of silence.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Release.aspx?id=MOD-CD-304,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Avant-Garde,United States,2018,2018 Mode Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

His subjects are the sheen of dragonflies, sacred birch bark scrolls, and the cataclysmic nature of ecstatic mystical experience, interpreted by renowned cellist Kivie Cahn-Lipman and an all-star roster of musicians. At the center of the album is The Dante Samadhi, the epic setting of Canto XXXIII from Dante’s Paradiso, a Western account of enlightenment made vivid with echoes of Monteverdi, Britten, and Pierce’s own ecstatic melodic language and searing vision of tonality. Blistering, virtuosic passagework and hankering emptiness share the stage in Silver Birch Scroll for solo cello with Aspen trees, and in the fiery string trio Lord of June.

With this aim in mind, the concert begins with the least possible instrumentation and the number of instruments on site is increased until the last piece is programmed. In this sense, the recital presented on this album meets precisely the same criterion. Thus, the program begins with a solo piano piece followed by a duet between viola and piano. The third piece that can be heard is a string quartet followed by a quartet with piano, that is, piano together with violin, viola, and cello. Then, the texture of another string quartet returns, ending the recital with a piano quintet where all the instrumentalists are on stage.

An earthquake, followed by a tsunami, destroyed the city of Lisbon, taking thousands of lives with them. Among the many victims of these events was Portugal’s musical heritage. The entire music collections kept mainly in one of the wings of the Royal Palace were lost.  Luckily, Portuguese music manuscripts from before 1755 are still preserved in other archives. This is the material used for this release. The program is representative of the different facets of the relatively scarce evidence of Portuguese music that survived the catastrophic loss of 1755: music in Portuguese, music by a Portuguese composer, music from the Portuguese colony, Spanish music in Portugal, and Portuguese popular music. The program of this recording revives these precious pearls of great importance, offering the public a rare opportunity to enjoy 16th -century “Portuguese songs” in a performance full of wit and vivacity.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Release.aspx?id=PC10385,01 Classical,Classical,,Netherlands,2018 Note 1 Music,2018 Note 1 Music,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the first document that contains this term is in a collection of sonatas by Giulio Cesare Arresti published in 1665. From a musicological point, this fact is of big importance because of its philological use to standardize the word in the future as a fix term to name the instrument. Based on this background, the ensemble decided to choose a specific repertoire taking into account the historical context of the cello’s use as a solo instrument. The main part of this instrumental journey is dedicated to the first collection of music for violoncello, the Ricercate sopra il Violoncello o clavicembalo, Opera Prima by Giovanni Battista degli Antonii, published in Bologna in 1687.

This collection of Takemitsu’s piano music is filled with a quizzical air and often touches of oblique humor, as though someone is smiling, somewhere. With warm, softly resounding chords and pitter-pattering melodic motifs above, Takemitsu’s piano so often evokes rain gently falling on earth and leaves. There are bright, brisk flashes of light as well as a pervasive undertone of melancholy, which in a work such as Les Yeux Clos can be accounted for by the work’s nature as a memorial to a friend.  The poetic title of For Away is matched by the distant reverie of its notes: ‘my expression of extolment,’ according to the composer, ‘and an offering to the Galaxy of Life – a galaxy that is not the sole domain of mankind.’ This is among the most harmonically spare and experimental works on the album, whereas Litany draws inspiration from Eastern modes as well as their reinterpretation at the hands of Debussy and Messiaen. Perhaps the boldest piece Takemitsu wrote for piano is Piano Distance, which is notated without a clear metre in the hyper-distilled style of Webern. Born in 1987, the Belgian pianist Lukas Huisman has made a speciality of new music, studying with the likes of Ian Pace and Geoffrey Douglas Madge. Through these and other teachers he has immersed himself in the complex worlds of Brian Ferneyhough and Kaiksohru Sorabji, among others, requiring a phenomenal technique as well as an appetite for the unfamiliar and challenging.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Release.aspx?id=PCL10147,01 Classical,Classical,,Germany,2018 Piano Classics,2018 Piano Classics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Six months later he made this, his debut studio album, which is sure to be listened to eagerly by pianophiles across the world. Pierdomenico played the Second Concerto of Liszt in the Van Cliburn competition final, and his performance won him the Raymond E. Buck Jury Discretionary Award; his semifinal performance of Chopin’s First Ballade was included on the internationally released album of highlights from the competition. Born in Pescara, he has performed across Italy having graduated from his local conservatoire, as well as giving recitals in major venues in Berlin and Brussels. Liszt is a natural choice for his debut recital. However, Pierdomenico has largely chosen the path less well trodden in his selection from Liszt’s vast oeuvre. He has concentrated on the brooding, melancholic and introverted sides of the composer’s multifaceted personality. The Csardas macabre is one of Liszt’s most radical conceptions, with sequences that push at the boundaries of tonality. The two are Legendes based on the miracles of two of the composer’s namesake Saints, St. Francis of Assisi, who allegedly preached a sermon to an attentive flock of birds, and St. Francis of Paola who, legend has it, crossed the Strait of Messina fashioning a vessel from his cloak and staff after a ferryman refused him passage. As well as the justly ubiquitous Second Ballade, Pierdomenico gives a rare outing to the ‘crusader’s song’ of the First; another rarity is the single-movement Scherzo und Marsch which finds the composer in heroic vein, replete with demanding fugato sections and rapier-like arpeggios.",https://youtu.be/mPCIVDdt6jk,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Release.aspx?id=PCL10151,01 Classical,Classical,,Germany,2018 Piano Classics,2018 Piano Classics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2018,Quartz Music,QTZ2130,880040213024,Johann Sebastian Bach; Toru Takemitsu ,Bach: Goldberg Variations; Takemitsu: Rain Tree Sketch II,Reiko Fujisawa ,1,CD,13.25,20.99,"Bach’s Goldberg Variations consists of an aria and 30 dazzling variations. The opening aria is a highly ornamented Sarabande. Melodic contour is wonderfully crafted as Bach explores a descending five-note pattern in a typically French style. However, from the first variation it becomes clear that melody is not the theme. Instead Bach produces variations on the bass line and its chord progression. In other words, it is a harmonic universe that Bach explores. The thirty variations are generally divided into three groups: dance, canon and arabesque. Every third variation in the set is a canon that increases by its intervallic answer, beginning at the unison until Variation 27 which is a canon at the ninth. Such a feat is in itself a contrapuntal exercise in genius; more so as these variations are not heavy with cerebral skill, but instead, dance with sparkling lightness. Toru Takemitsu composed his Rain Tree Sketch II in 1992, in memory of Olivier Messiaen, the French composer who was a strong influence on Takemitsu. The title of the work was probably inspired by a quotation from a novel by Kenzaburo Oe, Atama no ii, Ame no Ki: “it was named the ‘rain tree’, for its abundant foliage continued to let fall rain drops from the previous night’s shower until the following midday. Its hundreds of thousands of tiny, finger-like leaves store up moisture, whereas other trees dry out at once.” The work is a dreamy meditation on the flow of life, and was Takemitsu’s last piano piece.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Release.aspx?id=QTZ2130,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Piano,Lithuania,2018 Reiko Fujisawa,2018 Quartz Music Ltd,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The opening track, Carolan’s Si bheag, si mhor sets the tone for the album, beginning with the solo pipes before being underpinned by Barry Guy’s jazz-influenced bass-riffs and then the singing strings of the rest of the group. What follows in compositions by Telemann, Purcell and Leclair, and a number of traditional tunes is a celebration of Ireland’s musical history. Key to the performance of both styles of music is ornamentation – the use of grace notes, runs and trills - which brings the written notes alive, giving the music a feeling of improvisation. So while the music derives from the eighteenth century, this live exploratory edge really gives these performances a contemporary feel.",https://bit.ly/2rbFHUB,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Release.aspx?id=RTECD156,01 Classical,Classical,World|Traditional Celtic,Irish Republic,RTE lyric fm,RTE lyric fm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Originality is, to be sure, an important quality in nearly any compositional masterpiece. But as the accumulated trove of Western art music has grown over time, its substance and traditions have provided rich stimulus to composers’ imaginations. Each of the three compositions recorded here entails, among other things, an ingenious transformation of pre-existing musical material or styles. The eight-voice, Grammy Award-winning vocal ensemble Roomful of Teeth joins the Seattle Symphony and Ludovic Morlot in an exhilarating live performance of Luciano Berio’s Sinfonia. Morlot paired Berio’s Sinfonia with Boulez’s Notations and Ravel’s La valse, creating a sonic spectrum unlike any other.

A chorister at St. Paul’s Cathedral, he subsequently took private lessons with Alexander Goehr whilst reading initially English and then Music at Cambridge. His doctoral thesis at Oxford became the book ‘Debussy and Wagner.’ Returning to lecture at Cambridge he was later appointed Professor of Composition before retiring in 2011. His many students include Judith Weir, Huw Watkins, Thomas Ades, George Benjamin, Peter Seabourne, and David Collins. Holloway’s early works were complex and modernist. What followed, namely his ‘Scenes from Schumann,’ caused much controversy for its radical reengagement with Romanticism, both in gesture and use of tonality. His mature style could be said to forge a path between the two, with excursions more fully into each. This refusal to be constrained is a feature of his musical thinking.

He reads with enormous exactitude,” wrote Bertolt Brecht in his work diary on July 26, 1942, thus paying Hanns Eisler a subtle compliment that he never lavished on any other of his musical fellow-travellers. At this time, the two artists were in Hollywood, having emigrated to California to escape the Nazis. Eisler received more and more commissions to earn a living: during his ten-year exile in the USA, he was twice nominated for Oscar film music awards. Besides the bread-and-butter commissions, this period also saw him write the “Hollywood Songbook”, which includes 28 Brecht settings as well as the Holderlin Fragments, thus encompassing a vast range of musical and literary styles. The present recording covers the cosmos of Eisler's song art in all its scope. The life of the French singer Barbara was also heavily influenced by the political circumstances of the 20th century: there is no ""original"" piano accompaniment by Barbara on the album. The arrangements that Daniel Fueter has made for a scenic performance replace in their stylistic range and colorfulness more than a companion volume.

Performed by the Royal Birmingham Conservatoire Chamber Choir, directed by Paul Spicer and with dexterous support from organist Nicholas Morris, The Glory and the Dream features 12 varied and vivacious choral pieces composed over more than 50 years. The album’s striking title work sets Wordsworth’s ode Intimations of Immortality to music that conjures childhood rapture and adult fears with the utmost finesse and feeling and features a fearsomely complex and challenging organ accompaniment. Dating from 1961, the earliest pieces here are Two Madrigals in which Bennett treats the rich ornamentations of the 17th century to a wholly modern perspective. The most recent work, One Equal Music – a sinewy, austere anthem with a serene ending – was completed in February 2012, just 10 months before the composer’s death at the age of 76. Bennett’s fascination with the Elizabethan and Jacobean eras is also to be found in the elegiac partsong A Contemplation Upon Flowers, the vocal fanfare This Day and Time, a somber meditation on the finality of life and lasting effulgence of Christ’s eternal being, and the simple but affective carol I wonder as I wander. Other seasonal pieces include the early, plainchant-infused The Sorrows of Mary, the gentle ‘hush song’ Lullaby Baby and late, substantial Remember, O thou man, a fervent and heartfelt prayer ending in quiet contemplation.  Previous Royal Birmingham Conservatoire Chamber Choir recordings on SOMM have included admired recordings of choral music by Herbert Howells, Samuel Barber and John Joubert, together with partsongs by Ireland, Delius and Stanford.",https://soundcloud.com/siva-oke/the-glory-and-the-dream-i,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=SOMMCD%200184,01 Classical,Classical,,EU,2018 SOMM Recordings,2018 SOMM Recordings,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There’s a loose definition (or maybe tacit agreement) that Celtic Music is found in those European cultures where the Celtic tribes invaded. Aside from Ireland and Scotland, Wales qualifies, as does Brittany, the Galician part of Spain, the Isle of Man. If we focus just on the Gaelic language group and fine tune it to just Scotland and Ireland, we really know what we are hearing, right? Do we? While there is plentiful cross-pollination between these two nations and an ancient shared heritage, they are not the same place, and their music is not a single common recipe using slightly different ingredients. Irish stew is not haggis. There are differences grand and small, subtle and great.

Here she takes up the cause of supremely expressive music by Finnish composers. Aho, like his compatriots Einojuhani and Nordgren, parted ways with the patriarch of Finland’s national music, Jean Sibelius. Yet he too perpetuates the maverick willfulness of Finnish music, influenced not least by the country’s national epic, the Kelevala. Indeed, the dichotomy between this tradition and his urgent desire to embrace new currents has had a formative impact on his creative output. Aho’s Solo 1 dates from 1975. At first, tentative sustained pitches lure us into realms of refection and reverie in the manner of a prologue. Then the work plunges all the more emphatically into the tempestruous and clamorous. Yet its provocative, far flung arcs of sound are more suggestive of inward struggles and emotional conflicts than external incidents or plot lines. One year after Aho’s Solo 1, Einojuhani Rautavaara composed his Varietude for unaccompanied violin as a compulsory piece for the Sibelius Violin Competition in Helsinki. Here his characteristic plurality of stylistic devices bursts into dazzling turmoil, with lilting transmutations of dance gestures and madcap forays through an imaginary mental wilderness.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Release.aspx?id=TRO-CD 01452,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Violin,Germany,Troubadisc,Troubadisc,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The outstanding young artist has drawn attention to himself, not only with his numerous prizes at the “Jugend musiziert” competition, but also with recital programmes that include the most important and difficult piano works from the Classical and Romantic repertoire and provoke ecstatic ovations from his audiences. Christoph Preiss has grown into an artist with a fascinating technique and unconventional, original interpretational skills; one who has become an insiders’ tip among connoisseurs. This recording with Bach’s Chromatic Fantasia and Fugue, Beethoven’s Waldstein Sonata and Tchaikovsky’s Grand Piano Sonata (that has such an awesome reputation among pianists), demonstrates the facility and virtuosity of this young man, who is blessed with a highly developed instinct for the stylish requisites of such differing epochs, and with pianistic abilities that overcome technical demands with no difficulty at all. Christoph has a healthy individuality at his disposal that manifests itself in all his interpretations, and armed with this, he pits himself against all forms of conformist, hackneyed and boring academicism. Incidentally, instead of the short middle section of the Waldstein Sonata, Christoph Preiss plays Beethoven’s “Andante favori” that the composer originally intended as the second movement but which has, as yet, not been taken seriously by performers.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=TXA18101&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Germany,2017 TYXart,2018 TYXart,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One must visualize the possible repertoire, think and re-think, decant and finally find a sense of unity within a whole that is made up of the diverse. In this context, one has to encode to decode. In the same way, one must receive, with patience and care, the hidden message that comes from afar, through sounds, atmospheres, timbres and textures cutting the air to talk about what words cannot capture, to remind us that each imaginary space is inhabited by sound worlds that are there to be discovered or revisited. In Encodings, six works by Mexican composers converge and they are nothing more than invitations to undertake a trip to the inside of the cello, to its most intimate sonorities. The journey will take us to a re-discovery of the primordial fire, to an encounter with a language on verge of disappearing, which is at the same time distant and close, while we pass through a tormented monologue with all its introspective landscapes, to the white noise of everyday reality. The six pieces collected in here, reflect in different ways part of the voice and artistic expression of at least three generations of Mexican composers.
