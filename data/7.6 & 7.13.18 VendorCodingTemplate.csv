The focus of the album grew further to encompass the goal of honoring female composers as a result of collaboration with renowned soprano Dr. Julianne Baird in Philadelphia in December of 2016. These events coincided with the Women's March in Washington DC the next month in January of 2017, lending a sense of timeliness to the project. The focus of an album of songs by women composers and other songs about women is unique, and brings to the fore the vast social change the world is undergoing with respect to women in our society, both in the United States and elsewhere around the world. Each piece addresses this separately from different points of view, in some cases from a previous age where the standards of women's expectations were very different than today. The World Premiere of “Still” by outstanding and innovative composer Paola Prestini, sung as a duet by sisters, brings the album's concept full circle with a song composed for and dedicated to this album. Also included are two piano pieces performed by Mila Henry, both by female composers, “Light” by Iranian composer Gity Razaz and “No. 2” from “Nine Short Piano Pieces” composed by Ms. Henry's mother-in-law. In all, this is an album for the age of the woman and about the age in which we live.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=AF1805&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Chamber Music,United States,2018 Affetto Records,2018 Affetto Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cellist Kate Dillingham, “…an excellent cellist: dignified and compelling…an extraordinary performer,” is the soloist with the Brno Philharmonic, Czech Republic in this exciting new release. In the opening bars, the listener is invited immediately in to the heart of the composer's creative powers of invention. Recorded in the beautiful Besedni Dum, in Brno, Czech Republic, the phenomenal acoustic and superb artistry of the Czech musicians in their beautiful collaboration with Ms. Dillingham display the full range of color and allow the most profound human emotions found in music to flow forth. The cello concerto differs from Dvorak's previous piano and violin concertos given the important role of the orchestra, which is an equal partner to the solo instrument throughout the work. In the solo part, Dvorak made remarkable use of the varied and rich sounds the cello can produce, and its unique ability to convey broad, singing melodies. Dillingham's beautiful tone and fine musicianship bring a fresh interpretation to the grand scale heroism contrasted with the profoundly poetic world expressed in Dvorak's iconic work. Included on this album are two short pieces Dvorak composed for cello and piano. Due to their immense popularity with listeners, the composer arranged them for cello and orchestra. Tranquility, melancholy and a burnished quality characterize “Silent Woods” op. 68/5, in contrast to the energetic and delightfully playful “Rondo” Op. 94.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=AF1806&medium=phydig,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Cello,Czech Republic,2018 Affetto Records,2018 Affetto Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Linkola's music has been an integral part of the choir's repertoire ever since. In 2010, KYN commissioned music from Linkola bringing about Outo kantele (Strange Kantele), a suite composed for a female choir and jazz ensemble based on texts from the collection of folk poetry the Kanteletar. Five movements of the suite were recorded for the album Virtaan in 2011. Now the seven movement suite is heard in its entirety with a new orchestration: choir, accordion and piano. The suite is characterized by the varied rhythmic patterns and rich harmony of ethnic jazz. Outo kantele looks through the past to the future as old texts are transformed into fresh music. Loitsut (Incantations) is a nine movement a cappella suite for female choir.

Like his fellow Italians Michelangeli, Vidusso and Fiorentino, he possessed an immaculate technique, which gives his playing a sense of lightness and ease in even the most difficult passages. The recorded Liszt etudes are almost unrivalled in their virtuosity and in Scarlatti and Bach the evenness of his finger-work has to be heard to be believed. But he was a poet and a colorist too, as the more lyrical works of Chopin, and the Debussy Poissons d'or reveal. Sadly, Zecchi's recorded repertoire is small and this release includes an example of every piano work he recorded on 78s.

Having for many years performed at the great international halls, it is often considered as the successor to the famous Quartetto Italiano. The musical style of the Quartetto di Cremona is marked by a fruitful tension between Italian and German-Austrian influences. Following their academic studies the players continued their training with Piero Farulli of the Quartetto Italiano. He strongly favored intuitive playing and a fervent, emotional, romantic, and “Italian” approach to music. Afterwards the musicians pursued their studies with Hatto Beyerle of the Alban Berg Quartet. He represented a clear, classical “German-Austrian” style.

Despite their retrospective musical language, these pieces at that time belonged to the most topical works of contemporary music production. Also, the small instrumentation presented the opportunity for Fricsay to train the soloistic potential of his musicians.

Toru Takemitsu had to distance himself from his own culture in order to listen to Japanese music with the ears of a Western-trained musician- adopting, for instance, the approach of John Cage. He came to realize that Japan's venerable musical tradition had long been highlighting individual notes as complex sonorities in their own right, instead of treating them as part of a series of several notes. From the human need for sound as well as silence, John Cage drew the most extreme conclusions. The concept of a “beautiful” sound was never static in music history: it has changed over the centuries, and it differs from one culture to another. Western musical aesthetics tend to differentiate between “noises” and “notes”: the latter feature well-ordered harmonics. The concept of “dissonance” has also changed throughout different musical periods. What is more, musicians and their audiences have always felt the need to “savor” a dissonance- to listen to it consciously, to experience it- before it is resolved. This release showcases Debussy, Cage, and Takemitsu as they explore these ideas, as Sheila Arnold exploits the sound of the grand piano, bringing the listener into the space between the notes.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=AVI%208553257&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Germany,2018 Sheila Arnold,"2018 Avi-Service for music, Cologne/Germany",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This album features 14 of Arnowitt's own compositions with the composer himself at the piano, joined by a dozen jazz notables including Yosvany Terry on alto sax, Lucas Pino on tenor sax, Dave Smith on trumpet, and Colin Stranahan on drums. Against the Wind, featuring vocalist Shirley Crabbe, tells the story of a woman summoning the strength to persist in the face of powerful forces. In The Crossing, bassist Rick Rosato's accompaniment to the spoken words of a Langston Hughes poem evolves into a slow groove of brushes, keys, bass, and sax, rendering the listener completely spellbound. Syria-us is the creative culmination of a deep study Arnowitt made of Syrian literature and music in preparation for benefit concerts he organized in 2016 to support humanitarian aid for Syrian refugees. The composer's love of Bulgarian music is shown in Bulgarian Hoedown's wild, exuberant fiddling and Shapka Swing, which opens with a triumphant fanfare that transitions to klezmer before emerging as the energetic gem of the album. Ascent features a reading of Maya Angelou's celebrated poem Still I Rise combined with a flirtatious melody and syncopated accompaniment reflecting the spunkiness of both poet and poem. With Sweet Spontaneous, Michael Arnowitt encapsulates the journey of world music into jazz with dignity, class, and just the right amount of swing.

When he decided to devote himself exclusively to the historic lute repertoire it was with some regret that he gave up his first love. During his last year with the modern guitar Lindberg was working on Benjamin Britten's Nocturnal after John Dowland, one of the seminal guitar works of the 20th century. Much later, when he learned that Britten had originally had in mind to compose a piece for the lute, he started to experiment playing sections of Nocturnal on his Renaissance lute, and soon decided to make a transcription of the complete work. Nocturnal is based on Dowland's four-part song Come, Heavy Sleep, and inspired by this, Jakob Lindberg has placed it as the center piece of a recital with mostly Elizabethan pieces, many of which also evoke aspects of the night. Dowland himself is represented by a selection of six lute solos, while the opening section consists of five pieces by Dowland's older colleague Anthony Holborne.

During the first half of the 20th century, the great innovator Charles Ives injected a recognizably American sound into the genre, however, and since then the American symphonic legacy has been both wide and varied. With the present release, conductor Lance Friedel strikes a blow for three fellow American composers, with the help of the eminent London Symphony Orchestra. The album opens with Walter Piston's Symphony No. 6. It was completed in 1955, by which time many regarded Piston (1894–1976) as clinging to tradition in the face of modernism. When Samuel Jones (b.1935) presented his Third Symphony 'Palo Duro Canyon' in 1992, the pendulum was swinging back, however, and traditional music built of melody, harmony and rhythm was no longer considered hopelessly outdated. The work nevertheless begins in a rather non-traditional fashion with the recorded sound of the wind of the Texas plains, where the Palo Duro Canyon is situated. Jones's slightly younger colleague Stephen Albert (1941–92) was just completing his Second Symphony when he was killed in a car accident.

He has in fact written some ten quintets alone, for various combinations of instrument. Two are 'normal' wind quintets and it is these that the Berlin Philharmonic Wind Quintet (BPWQ) perform on the present release. The ensemble came into contact with the Finnish composer's Wind Quintet No. 1 in 2010, and was immediately struck by the qualities and challenges of the score. The composer himself has described the difficulties in writing for wind quintet, in terms of achieving a balanced and homogeneous sound and soft dynamics. In his first quintet he therefore included unison passages and sometimes even reduced the music to one or two parts. In the fourth movement he also added a spatial dimension by having all of the players perform from offstage at some point. Having played the work a number of times on their many tours, the BPWQ decided to commission their own quintet, and in 2015 they gave the first performance of Wind Quintet No. 2. This time, Aho found another solution to the inherent difficulties – by making the flutist and oboist change instruments to piccolo or alto flute and cor anglais at various points, the piece achieves an even wider spectrum of unusual and innovative tone colours and moods.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=BIS-2176&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Contemporary Era,EU,"2018 BIS Records AB, Sweden","2018 BIS Records AB, Sweden",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Taking inspiration from both dance and literature, he writes music that has been described as pulsating with feverish tension and vibrating rhythms, outgoing but with room for fragile and lyrically expressive moments. The three works gathered here were composed between 2011 and 2014, with two multi-movement works flanking the single-movement Tales from Suburbia. The work is inspired by the idea of suburbs embodying the transition between countryside and urbanity, where the organic world of nature contrasts with concrete structures and where past meets present. Framing Tales from Suburbia are two concertos, one for cello and one for orchestra, which both owe a debt to the rock band Pink Floyd's iconic album Dark Side of the Moon. The work titles – Crazy Diamond and Brain Damage – are both borrowed from the album tracklist, and the individual movements carry titles taken from the lyrics. As Schnelzer himself explains in his liner notes, he hasn't used any actual musical quotations but the lyrics have provided catalysts for his own music. In the cello concerto his focus has been on the fate of Syd Barrett, one of the founder members of Pink Floyd who was forced to leave the band due to deteriorating mental health. Brain Damage – Concerto for Orchestra on the other hand can be seen in terms of wandering through a series of different moods: anger, frustration, grief and perhaps even a glimpse of hope.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=BIS-2313&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Contemporary Era,EU,"2018 BIS Records AB, Sweden","2018 BIS Records AB, Sweden",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Slovak soprano is undoubtedly one of today's most well-known interpreters of coloratura opera singing, and especially of Italian bel canto.

Flattering epithets such as ""the Queen of Coloratura"", ""the Slovak Nightingale"" or ""prima donna assoluta"" are hardly exaggerated, for they really do represent what Edita Gruberova has embodied for almost half a century. She is celebrated all over the world for her perfect mastery of vocal technique, her astonishing ability to master even the most difficult coloraturas and highest notes, her clear and precise intonation and, most importantly, for something that overshadows and transfigures everything else: the seductive and beguiling timbre of her voice.

In 1850, his family moved to Vienna. His parents were both very musical and soon realized that the young Ignaz had great musical skills. Brull's mother encouraged him by giving him his first piano lessons, but it was evident that he required more professional tuition, and he became a pupil of Professor Julius Epstein. Later he would study under Anton Rufinatscha and then Otto Dessoff. By the age of 14 he had composed his first piano concerto. Being based in Vienna had many advantages, the most apparent being the contact with so many prominent and influential composers, performers and conductors. Brull and Johannes Brahms became firm friends, a friendship which lasted until Brahms' death. Even Brahms' orchestral works, including the symphonies, were first played by Brahms and Brull on two pianos for friends and publishers. Brull wrote over 100 works for solo piano, many orchestral and chamber works and numerous operas. Sadly, nearly all his works have been ignored by the music establishment for more than a century, and the public have been denied access to Brull's qualities which were so evident to Brahms. Even his close friendship with Brahms could not save him from the anti-Semitism being fuelled by Wagner and Liszt during the 19th century. Hitler idolized Wagner, and he ordered that music scores of Jewish composers be found and burnt. Fortunately for us, many of them were well hidden.

For the virtuoso parts in his three cello sonatas, Gernsheim could draw on his own brilliant piano technique, which he had demonstrated already in 1850 as an eleven-year-old child prodigy. The five works span five decades. The Sonata in D minor op. 12 from 1868 continues to follow the paths of Mendelssohn's two sonatas, while the Sonata in E minor op. 79 of 1906 is a dramatically charged work in the style of the turn of the century. The cello composition Elohenu of 1881 and the Andante op. 64bis from 1898 are situated between them chronologically.

The surprising fact is that neither Reizenstein nor Goldschmidt felt drawn to Schonberg's method of twelve-tone composition. In 1934 and 1935 both composers fled from Berlin to England, that is, prior to the tightening of immigration requirements. Influences from Reizenstein's teachers Paul Hindemith and Ralph Vaughan Williams are audible in the rather harsh, expressionistic character of his concerto. Raphael Wallfisch writes of this work, “Reizenstein's Cello Concerto is a tour de force for the cellist. What is involved here is an epic and heroic statement in which lyrical and dramatic elements alternate.”",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=555109-2&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Cello,Germany,2018 cpo,2018 cpo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This family of musicians from Bohemia came to Germany in 1742 at the request of Frederick the Great, King of Prussia (1712-86), and served at the court there for a century. The unknown Benda with whom we are concerned here was Friedrich Wilhelm Heinrich, the son of Franz Benda and nephew of Georg Benda. He was born in 1745 and died in 1814. Although he wrote operas, cantatas, and oratorios, he is best known for his instrumental compositions and for the concertos he wrote for various instruments. His talent as a gifted violist and violinist also made him a popular interpreter. The virtuoso passages in his three concertos for viola demonstrate his perfect mastery of the instrumental technique of the viola typifying his times. We have our soloist Jean-Eric Soucy to thank for the discovery of the viola concertos, and he in turn is grateful to the Edition Offenburg publishing company, which with its outstanding correction work has made available a wonderful gift for all violists.

It was not until the romantic era that Oriental or Arabian color very deliberately was incorporated into symphonic music, whether in Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov's Scheherazade (1888) or in Engelbert Humperdinck's Maurische Rhapsodie (1898). Right in the first movement of his symphony Romberg used the title “A la turca” to get his audience to anticipate Turkish color. The gradually intensified initial part goes over into a passage with the expected percussion accents and swiftly whirling violin figures. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's Violin Concerto in A major, the last of his five violin concertos, is also regarded as a concert piece with Turkish color. In the rondo finale there is a famous interlude in A minor in which the violoncellists and double bassists beat the rhythm on the strings with their bow sticks. This too produces the popular “Alla turca” flair. Our soloist is the young Swiss musician Julia Schroder, and it is not least in the swift main part of the Haydn overture that things sound “Turkish”; here not only the timpani but also the bass drum and cymbals accentuate the rhythm.

A lonely, curious, and stateless musician, never forgetting his roots. While struggling within he was capable of projecting himself with pioneering projects and exploits. At one point, he abandoned everything proudly, with stubborn silence, and prolonged absence from performance. This could be, at a glance, Rendano's profile: a somewhat neglected advocate of the mid-nineteenth-century Italian generation, which had the difficult task of shortening the distance between the ""Country of melodrama"" and the European classical-romantic culture. Rendano was born in 1853, in Carolei (located a few miles from Cosenza) and he died in Rome in 1931. He had shown his talent at a very early age. The pieces recorded on this album give us a double image of Rendano at his debut. He was able to grow as a composer by using different registers. The three waltzes dating back to the early 1870s, though distinct in their character, give us a view of the young pianist-composer as fully involved in the style of his time. He was part of the “Salonmusik”, where all nineteenth-century pianists careers developed. Here they presented themselves with their own elegant, seductive, and more communicative compositions. The “Quintet in A minor” for piano and strings, together with the Piano and Orchestra Concerto, are the most demanding compositions of Rendano's youthful years. In fact, the two works were presented by the author as his ""business card"", in one of the most important moments of his career: his meeting with Liszt and the performances at the Grand Duke of Weimar in 1880.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=DIGR80&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Chamber Music,Italy,Digressione Music,Digressione Music,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Vespro Breve by Antonino includes the following psalms: Dixit Domunis, Confitebor, Beatus vir, Laudate pueri and a Magnificat; two less than that by Giovanni Maria and precisely Nisi Dominus and Laetatus sum, not taken into consideration by the composer from Turi. Among the many aspects that characterize this impressive work, it is important to emphasize the stylistic continuity between Giovanni Maria and Antonino who best expresses what he learned from his uncle, but in an original way, demonstrating a talent worthy of his teacher.

This attractive but difficult quest has unfortunately been marked by a lack of the necessary care, not to mention purely artistic deficiencies, so that none of the releases deserves the name “complete recording”. Since Schumann published several works in two more or less different versions, it is not legitimate in a “complete recording” to include only one of the versions, let alone to amalgamate two of them.

No change of notes or rhythms. The transcription is based on an “orchestration” of the text for four string players. As in an orchestra, all the instruments in the string quartet are not systematically required simultaneously: variations for two, three, or four instruments follow in succession. This redistribution of the material enables new lines to be heard that are often difficult to hear within the uniform sound context of the piano or harpsichord. The Goldberg Variations are a model of polyphonic writing, a synthesis of Bach's art and contrapunctal mastery: the fugue, the canon, the French overture ... Nevertheless, the work cannot be reduced to some mere austere exercise: the dances that permeate the cycle confer a superior dimension of accomplishment to the twilight of the baroque era.” If Ardeo- latin: I burn- is the name of this quartet, then it is also the attitude with which these four young women approach their repertoire; their success underscores this. Founded in 2001 at the heart of the Conservatoire National Superieur de Musique et de Danse in Paris, the Quatuor Ardeo today is one of the most prominent French ensembles of its kind.

She began lessons at Horten Music School at age five and later studied with professors Aage Kvalbein, Truls Mork, Frans Helmerson, and Torleif Thedeen. She is now a freelance cellist based in Oslo and in frequent demand as chamber musician and substitute principal cello with Norwegian orchestras, in addition to serving on the faculty of “Musikk pa Majorstua” as lecturer in cello. She plays a Nicolas Lupot cell from 1823, kindly lent to her by Dextra Musica. Ingrid Andsnes has established herself as one of Norway's leading pianists.

Martin,1,CD,13.25,20.99,"Composers search for inspiration in the past- they study and learn from their predecessors, often borrowing ideas and taking them in new directions. The two praeludia by Dietrich Buxtehude, both composed in the stylus phantasticus (fantasy style) serve as a basis for us to follow some such musical borrowings. Buxtehude's compositional style had a direct influence in J.S. Bach and his successors. New ideas grew out of the stylus phantasticus, influencing later composers such as Franz Liszt and Petr Eben, who heralded the past and proclaimed the future by writing new forms of the praeludium inspired by Buxtehude's style.

It was interesting and challenging to find a path through all the well-known facts about her life, in order to be able to envision her with fresh eyes and gradually to shape my own portrait of her. My interest in her as a subject was first aroused by a basic idea of Amalia Elguera, (who had written the libretto for my previous opera The Voice of Ariadne) and on whose play Moray the opera is based. Here the emphasis lies, as the title implies, on Mary's half brother James Stewart. I soon decided that in the opera, although the chief protagonist would be James, the central character must be Mary herself.” This recording is of a live performance on 2 April, 1978 in Norfolk, Virginia, at the gala performance for the Metropolitan Opera.

Fresh and trumpeter Mark Isham. Backed by a young versatile band and a collection of tunes written in the midst of a tumultuous tour of Europe, The Message swells with an abundance of strength, soul and astounding musicianship. Clarke comments: “The guys in this band are consummate young musicians with musical spirits that are very old.” In 2016 Clarke brought a band through Europe consisting of keyboardists Cameron Graves and Beka Gochiashvili and drummer Mike Mitchell. When a terrorist attack left them stranded in Paris, Clarke asked them to hunker down and compose. “We were in this great hotel and the owner was a fan,” remembers Clarke. “I said, 'Can you put these three guys in a room where no one can hear them?' He found a room and after two days, they wrote compositions that reflected their worldview and included their versatility in many different musical genres. A lot of this stuff I would have never written in a million years.” A few days later the band entered ICP Studios in Belgium and recorded an abundance of material. Clarke returned to his home in Los Angeles with the tapes and began to tinker. “Once I got the raw material, I fleshed it out. My ability is to orchestrate and arrange. I'm very good with taking anything and turning it into something.” Much of the material from their Paris adventure is collected on this album. “Our message is simple. It is a message of love. There is nothing really profound about our message. It's just love. A lot of artists have said it in their own way.

The Russian pianist now residing in Germany, Olga Andryushchenko graduated from the Moscow Conservatory where she studied historical and modern performing arts with Professor Alexei Lyubimov and later improved her skills as a post-graduate student of Hochschule fur Musik in Cologne. Having Russian music of the 20th and 21st centuries in her special focus of attention, she has recorded complete piano pieces by Alexander Mosolov and Nikolai Roslavets. Olga Andryushchenko considers her first Melodiya album a continuation of her work on domestic post-war avant-garde. The selection of works on the album is quite uncommon. The majority of the programme is made of works of the avant-garde classics created in the very beginning of their artistic careers in homage to neoclassicism – Sofia Gubaidulina's Chaconne, Arvo Pärt's Partita and Valentin Silvestrov's Sonata No. 1. In its own way, each of the pieces gives an idea of the composers' artistic essence. The other part is dedicated to music created during another period of existence of this school – the late 1980s and early 1990s – Galina Ustvoslkaya's Sonata No. 6 and Alfred Schnittke's Sonata No. 3. The air of freedom inspired by perestroika had a significant impact on the development of avant-garde, the status of which transformed from semi-legal to the leading direction of late-Soviet musical art.

The variation cycles for solo piano (Variations on a Theme of Chopin, Op. 22 and Variations on a Theme of Corelli, Op. 42), the first of which date back to Rachmaninoff's heyday and the other to his emigration period, are not among his most popular works. Nevertheless, they allow us to lift the veil over the creative workshop of the great composer and pianist and gain a greater understanding of the inner world of the creator and interpreter. Just as he does in his arrangements of other composers' music, Rachmaninoff remains true to himself in the variations on others' themes transforming Chopin's and Corelli's material in the hearth of his own artistic individuality. The genre of transcription is represented with Minuet from Georges Bizet's L'arlesienne Suite No. 1, Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy's A Midsummer Night's Dream, Pyotr Tchaikovsky's Lullaby and the composer's arrangements of the romances Lilacs and Daisies. The featured recordings of Rachmaninoff's works were made by Alexander Bakhchiev, Dmitri Bashkirov and Alexei Nasedkin, remarkable pianists of the second half of the 20th century, and Sergei Kasprov, a musician of the new generation, representative of Alexei Lyubimov's school, associate professor of the Moscow Conservatory and prize-winner of international competitions.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=MELCD1002542&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Russia,2018 AO,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This was an age when a large and diverse audience listened to and enjoyed classical music, and when the aristocratic element of that audience was well educated in music and supported and enabled its performance.

Haunting and lyrical throughout, the album explores themes of beauty, being, journey and transformation. The album's eleven tracks, some inspired by the poetry of Emily Dickinson and Walt Whitman and some created by Stolzel's own native curiosity, engage the listener intellectually, emotionally and spiritually. The album's title composition takes as its inspiration Emily Dickinson's envelope writings and weaves together five paper fragments into a beautiful song cycle. Soprano Sarah Tannehill Anderson performs against a backdrop of flute, oboe and piano, evoking a sense of both the poet's and the composer's creative spirits. In here there, performed by Navona violinist Veronique Mathieu and pianist Ellen Sommer, Stolzel plays with the subtlety of perspective. The interplay between piano and violin creates a sense of the instruments both attracting and resisting each other, much like the emotion one feels when torn between two places. In Soul Journey – Three Whitman Songs, Stolzel brings together three poems by Walt Whitman into a song cycle, which creates a journey of the soul from awakening to awareness to transcendence. These striking lyrical interpretations from Whitman's “Leaves of Grass” are soulfully interpreted by mezzo-soprano Phyllis Pancella and Ellen Sommer on piano. With Eyes Open takes as its source material Stolzel's earlier composition, “with both eyes.” Here, allowing herself to fully open to the idea of possibility, Stolzel takes the 2008 composition, originally written for flute, guitar, vibraphone and piano, and transforms it into a subtle and serene piece written for alto saxophone and piano. The album concludes with The Road is All, which takes as its inspiration a quote from a 19th century historian which translates to “The end is nothing; the road is all.” Each instrument – violin, cello and piano – travels on its own journey throughout the piece, sometimes solo and at other times converging, embracing the twists and turns, the unpredictability that is life, and the simple enjoyment of a moment in passing time.",https://youtu.be/5pESMb6kr4E,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=NV6169&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Contemporary Era,,,2018 Navona Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The album, which is the Choir's third release on Navona Records, includes 24 selections that range from Moravian and Silesian folk songs on which the Choir interprets the subtle call and response between bucolic lovers, to a series of compositions inspired by Latin proverbs on which intricate, multidimensional vocals underscore the significance of a simple word or phrase. While the album's tracks are assembled under specific groupings – Silesian Yodel Songs, The Replies of Silesian Songs, Moravian Folk Songs, and Proverbia – this merely delineates the source material. The unifying impact of the Choir's exquisitely crafted vocals elevates this album far above what might otherwise be an ethnomusicological exercise. For the most part, the choir performs without any instrumental accompaniment, save for several Moravian folk songs, on which a solo piano provides an additional layer of intricacy, and for the album's closing track, Hymnus. Combining the stirring instrumentation of kettledrum and organ with the Choir's uplifting vocals, Hymnus translates the positive, humanistic vision of John Amos Comenius, the 17th century educator, philosopher and theologian, into what serves as a superb melodious conclusion of this impressive recording. The Jitro Czech Girls Choir is a complex institution with a membership of around 350 young singers ranging between five and 19 years of age.

2018,Navona,NV6173,896931004732,Nicholas Vines,Vines: Hipster Zombies from Mars,Ryan MacEvoy McCullough,2,CD,11.69,17.99,"Nicholas Vines presents Hipster Zombies from Mars, his third PARMA Recordings album. This collection of three major piano works by Dr. Vines was recorded on location at Cornell University with artist Ryan MacEvoy McCullough at the piano. For all of the flash one might expect from the album title, Vines bypasses gimmickry in order to capture something sophisticated. Standouts include the four-movement Terraformation for pianoforte, inspired by Kim Stanley Robinson's science-fiction novel “Red Mars.” Vines depicts the technology's influence on nature by lifting traditional classical forms and acclimating them to a modernist viewpoint. McCullough captivates the listener with his careful attention to the futuristic timeline into which Vines' tone clusters have been poetically mapped. Indie Ditties: Twelve Scapes for Piano is a social commentary on the modern hipster movement. The multi-genre piano melodies are thoughtfully constructed, telling a story that is both interesting and musically complex. Concentrating carefully, a keen listener will hear familiar incidental phrases in the most unexpected of places (hint: Movement III, Bad Appletude is not about produce). Vines describes his compositional technique as “ firmly rooted in the technical resources of the Western classical canon, while embracing sounds and ideas from an array of popular, experimental, Australian and non-Western traditions. This combination of rigour and pluralism gives rise to music at once vectored and kaleidoscopic.” Popular media outlets have called the work of Dr. Nicholas Vines “exquisite,” “riveting,” “arresting,” “edgy, bright and entertaining as hell.” Hipster Zombies from Mars does not fail to deliver on these accolades.",https://youtu.be/2k5IMyfSXIY,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=NV6173&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Piano,,,2018 Navona Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2018,Navona,NV6170,896931004701,Richard Brodhead; David Finko; Modest Mussorgsky,Clipper Erickson: Tableau Tempest & Tango,Clipper Erickson,2,CD,11.69,17.99,"Navona Records artist Clipper Erickson presents a solo piano album of works by composers Richard Brodhead (1947- ), David Finko (1936-), and Modest Mussorgsky (1839-1881) entitled Tableau Tempest & Tango. The mostly Russian-themed album climaxes with Erickson's masterful interpretation of Mussorgsky's Pictures at an Exhibition. The original version for solo piano precedes the iconic orchestrations by many composers, most notably Maurice Ravel. For Erickson, the piano is his orchestra, and he conducts it marvelously through every movement, down to the famed finale, The Great Gate of Kiev. Stellar, too, is Erickson's interpretation of Finko's Fantasia on a Medieval Russian Theme, which is inspired by a grievous poem about the oppression of the Russian people. Finko's Sonata No. 1 Solomon Mikhoels is next. It has folk roots--budding from the composer's interest in Yiddish and Slavic cultures. Erickson executes the polarity in dynamic contrast and rhythmic complexity with incredible manual dexterity. Finko writes that his Sonata No. 2 “expresses the acute feelings of a sensitive intellectual who goes through several stages of personal sufferings and struggle.” Finko's Sonata No. 3, composed in 2009, is evocative of the evolution of the composer's technique since his first sonata in 1964. Erickson, too, shows an evolution -- the melodies become more fluid, the separation between each note more precise. The listener is transported to Brazil where Erickson presents Richard Brodhead's Una Carta de Buenos Aires, a truly dark tango. It is mysterious and vacant, but Erickson handles it like a delicate flower. The finale is Brodhead's Sonata No. 2, Sonata Notturna, dark, too, in its presentation, but Erickson's light shines on the meditation of terrors we hear at night. As evidenced on his previous recording, 2015's My Cup Runneth Over, Professor Erickson's prodigious performances are not only products of his superior musicianship, but also the in-depth studies he completes on every work performed. This is the best collection of such works to date. Tableau Tempest & Tango is a must-have for the collections of piano dilettantes and savants alike. As the LA Times notes, Erickson plays “with extraordinary dash and power and he never let[s] flamboyance obscure art.”",https://youtu.be/ca4dN91lM3I,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=NV6170&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Piano,,,2018 Navona Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2018,Navona,NV6167,896931004671,John Robertson,Robertson: Symphony No. 1,Janacek Philharmonic Orchestra,1,CD,11.69,17.99,"Deeply committed to a beauteous aesthetic, composer John Robertson's second album Symphony No. 1 once more delivers a neoclassical triumph with tremendous potential for repeated listening. This release flaunts an unapologetically exuberant elegance ever-present in the composer's oeuvre. The heart of the album is, of course, Robertson's Symphony No. 1, a three-movement epos that explores the vast realm of classical tonality. While the first movement starts out touching upon 20th-century harmonies reminiscent of Prokofiev, the second one already harkens back to the late Romantic school. Still, remaining very much a contemporary composition in its essence, this symphony offers plenty of innovation: not only does it push the limits of the traditional symphonic fast-slow-fast movement order, it also spearheads intensely lyrical soloistic parts such as the third movement's elaborate solo violin introduction, from which all other instruments organically spring forth. In the same vein, the Suite for Orchestra Op. 46 is easy on the ear, oscillating between the exaltation of the introductory Fanfare, the natural grace of the subsequent Waltz, the profound tristesse of the Elegy, and the uplifting, resolute splendor of the concluding March. The form of musical variations, the calling card of a composer's skill and craftsmanship throughout the ages, receives an apt treatment in the form of Robertson's Variations for small orchestra, Op. 14. In just over 18 minutes, they explore the possibilities of thematic development from every imaginable angle, ranging from the solidly-classical to the breezingly and self-confidently outlandish.

On 40 Years of Contemporary Music, the group combines compositions from such well-known Latin American composers as Heitor Villa-Lobos, Alberto Ginaslera, and Terzian herself with works by an international array of composers that ranges from Anton Weber to Luciano Berio to Franz Schreker to Pierre Boulez. Grupo Encuentros consists of mezzo soprano Marta Blanco, pianist Claudio Espetor, flutist Fabio Mazzetelli, clarinetist Matias Tchicourel, violinist Sergio Polizzi and violoncellist Carlos Nozzi. The program presented on 40 Years of Contemporary Music originally premiered at the annual Encuentros International Festival in Buenos Aires and truly highlights the brilliance of these award-winning musicians, who have earned high praise from such media outlets as the Los Angeles Times, where they were lauded as “deeply serious and challenging.” Over their 40 year-long career, the group has performed at dozens of prestigious venues, including London's Royal Albert Hall and New York City's Merkin Auditorium. 40 Years of Contemporary Music transcends cultural boundaries with such selections as Villa-Lobos' Choro No. 7, which unites the sounds of Amerindian primitivism with the polkas and waltzes of suburban dance halls in Brazil. Emphasizing her status as a renowned ethnomusicologist, Terzian dedicates her composition Yagua de Uca to the Chinguano and Chanel peoples, who belong to a lost indigenous northwestern Argentinian culture. O King was composed the same year as the assassination of Martin Luther King, a tragedy which deeply affected its Italian composer Luciano Berio. Grupo Encuentros founder Alicia Terzian has composed over 80 compositions for orchestras, orchestras with soloists, and chamber orchestras with and without soloists, musical theater, and multimedia. She travels the world giving seminars on composition and contemporary chamber music at universities and is often invited to participate on juries at international compositions.",https://youtu.be/qT-BixuGBZ0,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=NV6172&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Modern Era,,,2018 Navona Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Built on the agile writing and bel canto style that characterized the Neapolitan school, the Concerto in D major is unique in Mercadante's catalogue in being for two flutes. The great mutual respect between Mercadante and Rossini is brought vividly to life in the theme used for the masterly 'Tema con variazione.' The 'Capricci' can be compared with those for violin by Paganini, and the joyous 'Sixth Concerto' makes varied and eloquent use of the orchestra. Patrick Gallois belongs to the generation of French musicians leading highly successful international careers as both soloist and conductor. From the age of 17 he studied the flute with Jean-Pierre Rampal at the Paris Conservatoire and at the age of 21 was appointed principal flute in the Orchestre national de France.

This must change. We risk missing the true qualities, nuances and pedigree of individual composers' voices, as well as the cultural preoccupations that united them (as in the case of this album, the common fascination in the early twentieth century with translations of Chinese and Persian poetry). The deliberate inclusion of Richard Strauss (whose political allegiances are questionable) is because I wish the listener to hear beyond the names, beyond the painful historical facts and savor the incredible sound world created by these musical cousins. It is my wish that, by presenting all of these neglected composers as equals, we can begin to restore them to their rightful place, where they belonged all along, in our collective musical Consciousness.”",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=NI5971&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Art Song,United Kingdom,2018 Wyastone Estate Limited,2018 Wyastone Estate Limited,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As I began to work with them, I found myself speaking to the pianist, as I often do, in orchestral terms. “Can you try playing the opening phrase more like…. a quartet of hunting horns?” I asked…After the coaching I had a bit of free time, and found myself listening to an imaginary orchestral version of the entire first movement emerging from that horn quartet. I was fascinated by the ways in which I thought an orchestral realization could bring to the fore some the nature imagery and vernacular music that is present in the original. By the end of that morning, I'd decided to try to undertake a realization of the orchestration. It took several years from that morning on Ishcia to complete this orchestration. After my initial work on it in 2008, the piece was set to one side while I attended to other projects with firmer deadlines. The final version was premiered on 21 November, 2017 with the English Symphony Orchestra in Cheltenham Town Hall. The scores of Brahms' Four Symphonies are like a sacred text for me. They are among the most studied, most loved, most performed works in my library. In trying to understand his use of the orchestra well enough to translate this Piano Quartet into a symphonic sound world, I've found my admiration for Brahms' achievement continuing to grow.”",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=NI6364&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Orchestral,United Kingdom,2018 Wyastone Estate Limited,2018 Wyastone Estate Limited,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Scored for four percussionists playing bells from a wide variety of cultures and historical periods, Sonorous Earth can be heard and imagined as a United-Nations-of-Resonances. Probing into bells' rich meanings and characteristics as carriers of history, ethnicity, societal and cultural connotations is a joy and wonder. Bells can be used to celebrate grand occasions, hold sacrificial rites, keep a record of events, give the correct time, celebrate births and weddings, mark funerals, caution a community, enhance any number of religious ceremonies, and are even hung around the necks of animals. As carriers of history and culture, bells, of numerous shapes, sizes, types, decorative patterns, weights, functions, and cultural connotations, enrapture and inspire. Bells are central to Augusta's music; bells permeate her music. For over 25 years, in every work for orchestra, and in many for smaller ensembles, she has been composing music frequently using percussion consisting of bell sounds (pitched metal percussion and all the mallet percussion instruments) many of which have their origins in other than Western musical cultures.

Despite her success there in the role of Zerbinetta just eighteen months earlier, she was then still an insider tip for such a large bel canto role. Although studio recordings from subsequent years exist of this role which would later become Gruberova's hallmark, this early live recording has a quality that is missing from later recordings: the maidenly determination and yet stupendous vocal perfection that Gruberova delivers in her portrayal, her inimitable sonorous timbre – which she retains to this day – alongside the wonderfully intimate and yet tense partnership with Dvorský, whose passionate, burning tenor provides a unique highlight in his first duet with Gruberova's Lucia and supplies a further high point in the tricky final scene on a recording not short of such brilliant climaxes. Matteo Manuguerra's reading of Lucia's brother Enrico is a perilously relentless, masculine tour de force. Last but not least, the quickening touch of Giuseppe Patane's baton makes this a gem among the treasures of Edita Gruberova's discography, one never short of outstanding testimony to her consummate vocal skill and is a wonderful addition to that of Peter Dvorský, whose discography is sadly not so bountiful.

We live in an era of “one time pieces”; a new piece is born, premiered and disappears for decades or even forever. In my opinion, sometimes we should take a step back and look to the recent past and “revaluate” what could be some of the iconic masterpieces of our time. In this album I decided to bring a fresh look to the “old” pieces that influenced so many composers and players. This album includes some of the most emblematic compositions from the bass and contrabass clarinet repertoire. Chronologically starting with Ferneyhough, where we can find the most demanding passages that explore the limits of playability, to Donatoni where we have an exploration on timbre and dynamics. Jarrell and Staud, both dedicated to Ernesto Molinari, a virtuoso of the bass clarinet who inspired both composers to take the bass clarinet to a new level of writing. Closing with Cendo, the only composition with electronics, where he explores the art in the saturation of sound.

Interpreting the work of five notable modern composers who were, in turn, inspired by the words of poets throughout the ages, Nathanson and King deliver a stunning performance that is rich in its variety and impressive in scope. The album opens with William Neil's “Out of Darkness into Light”, which adds violin, saxophone, bassoon and contrabassoon to Duo Soreno's arrangement of what the composer described as a “mystery play interpreting through composed and improvisational music the prayer-like text written by Malgosia Sawczuk.” Along with violinist Danijela Žeželej-Gualdi, the duo interprets “Open the River,” with text from “To the Hand,” a poem by W.S. Merwin. The remaining pieces on Waking the Sparrow feature only Nathanson and King. “A Song of Unending Sorrow” is a three-movement setting for guitar and soprano, inspired by composer Jing Jing Luo's interpretation of a work by the Tang Dynasty poet Ba Juji. The performance, at once both simple and intricate, captures the ecstasy of love and the sorrow of loss. Pulitzer Prize and Grammy Award-winning composer William Bolcom's “Three Cabaret Songs” arise from his collaboration with poet Arnold Weinstein and are here for the first time arranged for soprano and guitar by guitarist Michael Lorimer.

My musical forms tend to show a reduction to homogeneous instrumental compositions… I conceived of a cycle over a lifetime, titled Similar, and its first chapter is to be the Lacrimosa or 13 Magic Songs for seven violins. Lacrimosa or 13 Magic Songs is a lamentation, man's final prayer before judgment. This prayer can at once be incisive and show the various states of mankind: gleeful, repenting, fearful, lamenting, faithful… During the performance of the 13 songs, the listeners' souls are supposed to pass through a series of excruciating, excessive stages, to finally reach a catharsis. This direction determines the cycle's dramaturgic structure. My aim is to transform an immediate, openly emotional response to powerful impressions- something most contemporary art refuses to deal with- into the musical form of the Lacrimosa. For all the varied techniques to be applied in the work, its emphasis is on the emotion, its aspiration to capture the listeners' minds, immersing them in the atmosphere of each part.

It was at this noble destination that the fifty-year-old Giovanni Battista Somis, forefather of the Piedmontese school of violin that included the most famous interpreters of Italian music, wrote these works and elaborated upon his compositional idea of extreme elegance that differed from the works being composed by his peers. Here, the works are recorded by Ensemble Il Continuo, which consists of Gioele Gusberti, Claudio Frigerio, and Marija Jovanovich, all renowned soloists and chamber musicians in their home countries.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=LDV14038&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Cello,Italy,2018 Leonardo by Urania Records and Manzoni Editore,2018 Leonardo by Urania Records and Manzoni Editore,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During the Soviet era, the opera was known as “Ivan Susanin.” The original Russian libretto, based on historical events, was written by Nestor Kukolnik, Egor Fyodorovich von Rozen, Vladimir Sollogub and Vasily Zhukovsky. The historical basis of the plot involves Ivan Susanin, a patriotic hero of the early 17th century who gave his life in the expulsion of the invading Polish army for the newly elected Tsar Mikhail, the first of the Romanov dynasty, elected in 1613. This production features opera stars Boris Christoff, Teresa Stich-Randall, Nicolai Gedda, and Mela Burgarinovitch along with the Belgrade Opera Chorus and Orchestre Lamoureux conducted by Igor Markevitch.

Born to Antonio Albinoni, a wealthy paper merchant in Venice, Tomaso Albinoni studied violin and singing. At an early age he became proficient as a singer and, more notably, as a violinist, though not being a member of the performers' guild he was unable to play publicly so he turned his hand to composition. On this release, the ensemble I Solisti Ambrosiani presents six of his works- three instrumental pieces, and three pieces with voice. What's more, four of these works are receiving here their world premiere recording. I Solisti Ambrosiani is an Italian ensemble specializing in ancient repertoire and in philological execution on original instruments. The group was founded in 2008 by Tullia Pedersoli (soprano) and Davide Belosio (violinist). The group finds its own style both in the temperament of the individual instruments and in a flexible instrumentation- from duo to chamber orchestra.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=LDV14039&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Baroque Era,Italy,2018 Leonardo series by Urania Records,2018 Leonardo series by Urania Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While the opera wasn't initially considered a success, the present recording aimed to bring the masterwork to the twentieth century listener. This production was recorded in 1957 in Rome with the Orchestra e Coro dell'Accademia di Santa Cecilia and several stars of the twentieth century opera stage, including Cesare Siepi, Mario Del Monaco, Lucia Danieli, and more. Italian conductor Tullio Serafin's numerous recordings testify consistently to his remarkable skills as an operatic conductor. Without exception they display a satisfying synthesis of the dramatic and lyrical, as well as respect for the singers involved. He recorded extensively in the studio with Maria Callas for Walter Legge and EMI; these recordings have stood the test of time well. Notable among these performances are those of Bellini's I puritani and Norma, Puccini's Manon Lescaut and Turandot, Verdi's Aida and La forza del destino, and the popular as well as powerful double bill of Mascagni's Cavalleria rusticana and Leoncavallo's Pagliacci.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=WS121.374&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Opera,Italy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2018,Wergo,WER73712,4010228737127,Igor Stravinsky,Stravinsky: Petrushka,Bugallo-Williams Piano Duo,1,CD,14.81,22.99,"The young Stravinsky became acquainted with large parts of the Western music repertoire through piano arrangements. That might have been one reason for his later compositional practice to arrange major works for piano duet or for two pianos as well. With the new album ""Petrushka"", the Bugallo-Williams Piano Duo has achieved its intention to present a complete collection of Igor Stravinsky's published piano arrangements. The present recording contains two ballets which show Stravinsky's compositional development within the genre: the almost film-like burlesque ""Petrushka"" (1910/11) as well as the abstract late work ""Agon"" (1953/57) which puts the ancient Greek concept of competition into a contradictory musical setting. In addition, it contains two arrangements of concert pieces: ""Concertino"" for string quartet (1920) lives on the alternation between homogeneous instrumental passages and soloistic crossed accents. The orchestral ""Scherzo a la Russe"" (1944) as 'jazz commercial' testifies to Stravinsky's adaptation to his life in America as well as to his love of the Russian types of form at the turn of the century. In their recording, Helena Bugallo and Amy Williams present the special charms of Igor Stravinsky's music in 'black and white': The piano arrangements reflect the sheer brilliance of his oeuvre in a concentrated form.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=WER73712&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Piano,Austria,2018 Wergo,2018 Wergo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Transitions from clearly defined forms to figures of great heterogeneity are fundamentally inscribed into the two compositions on this album. In Caspar Johannes Walters “metrische Dissonanzen” the solo percussionist and the ensemble transform harmonic relations into rhythmical processes, fanning out a vast sound universe. And in “Schwankende Zeit” (Swaying Time) Isabel Mundry relates two adaptions of pieces by Louis Couperin to three new pieces of hers and thus creates with numerous musical and extramusical stimuli a network of references and allusions, of nearness and remoteness. The artwork of the album shows Gerhard Richter's “Abstraktes Bild” from 1962, commenting in an artistic manner on the thematic concentration of the program from the highlights of the ""Musikfabrik im WDR"" series. Richter, one of the most important living German artists, has been a member of the board of trustees of the Ensemble Musikfabrik since 2009.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=WER68672&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Chamber Music,Germany,2018 Wergo,2018 Wergo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
