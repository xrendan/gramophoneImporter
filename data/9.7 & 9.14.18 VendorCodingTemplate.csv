A prolific composer with three thousand works to his credit, Caldara died in the Austrian capital in 1736 – in the Kärtnerstrasse, like Vivaldi five years later, and in a similar state of destitution. The genre, born in the wake of the Counter-Reformation and illustrated notably by the Roman composers Carissimi and Landi, was initially sung in Latin and performed in pious confraternities. But La Maddalena is an oratorio volgare, that is, sung in Italian. The protagonists of La Maddalena, six in number, are split between Earth and Heaven. They are Martha, Mary Magdalene and a Pharisee on the one hand; Jesus, Earthly Love and Divine Love on the other.

The music of the sons of Bach and especially of Carl Philipp Emanuel has already come to fascinate us, and we had the same urge to discover and let ourselves be surprised when we decided to tackle Geminiani. To immerse ourselves in his op.7 was an exciting process, questioning our experience of Baroque music and rousing the enthusiasm of all the musicians of Café Zimmermann.” (Celine Frisch, harpsichord) “WHAT?!” was the first stunned reaction of the musicians after reading through Geminiani’s Concertos op.7. A composition that is invariably controversial, at once surprising and familiar. Then it was a new discovery with each concerto, with different textures and styles from one movement to the other. This music led us along unexpected paths from the church to the theatre, from Italy to France, from the seventeenth century to the eighteenth.” (Pablo Valetti, violin) “Geminiani’s music reflects my state of mind, one foot in the seventeenth century and the other in the eighteenth. The rhetoric and architecture it employs are still compatible with the Baroque. But the choice and exploration of emotions are already very new, similar to the way we feel today. This state of inner contradiction was probably not always understood by Geminiani’s contemporaries, but it is exactly what we look for and admire nowadays.” (Petr Skalka, cello)",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/SearchQuick.aspx?qSearch=ALPHA%20396,01 Classical,Classical,,Austria,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Now it is precisely that fantastical (and also comical) dimension that is inscribed in the fable set to music Giovanni Pagliardi in Venice in 1672, which Vincent Dumestre brings back to life here. But above all, this portrait of Caligula as a hero of the impossible, a showman of wonders, has been rounded off with an idea that suddenly seems self-evident: Caligula, and all the characters around him, could only be “wooden actors”, puppets. The traditional Palermitan pupo – used in the famous puppet shows – is manipulated in full view of the audience by means of iron rods fixed to the head of the wooden character and one of the arms of the pupo, especially for the fight scenes, while the other arm is connected by a thread. The specific genius of the pupi is not mimetic, as in Venice, but poetic. Or, even better: epic. There is only one surviving representative of this popular art backed up by learned culture: Mimmo Cuticchio.

It was quite naturally that the idea emerged of coupling a youthful quartet, no.10, composed at the age of sixteen, with a masterpiece by the mature Schubert, the “Death and the Maiden” Quartet no.14. As in the case of Mozart on our first recording, we wanted to present two different atmospheres with two quartets by the same composer. This journey through time sheds a new light on the later works, because the process of getting to know the young Franz Schubert naturally means deepening our knowledge of his language, but also allows us to refine our appropriation of the style, sound and articulation specific to him. In Quartet no.10, we tried to achieve purity in our playing, a crystalline sound that allows the music to unfold in the most fluid and natural way, keeping in mind the intimacy of the family living room for which these pages were written. In no.14, more tormented, brusquer, more intense, we attempt to pay homage to the work’s symphonic dimension, and to its most sombre, most violent asperities. Two sides to one man: the bright and dark faces of Schubert.” Quatuor Van Kuijk",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=ALPHA%20417&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Austria,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Exquisitely recorded in the unique Yehudi Menuhin Hall in Stoke d'Abernon, Surrey, these pieces have been drawn from Richard's notebooks dating back to his student days and also from impressionistic memories with a distinctive wash of Mediterranean sunlight and color pervading the collection. Childlike in places and pensive in others, the music is a travel pass to warmer climes and shared memories. Having come through the ranks of a quintessentially British musical upbringing via Tiffin School, The Royal College of Music, and as a member of the British Youth Symphony Orchestra, Richard started composing in his early teens. He toured the USA and performed his own music at Madison Square Gardens, all before he was twenty. Like many other classical composers in the modern age, he also accepted commissions for TV and film music, and became best known for his work in this field until the turn of the millennium. Alongside rave reviews for his Concertos for Recorder Virtuoso, Michala Petri and for the legendary Violist, Roger Chase, Richard also won a British Academy Award for his score for Alan Bleasdale’s epic political drama “GBH” and has four Ivor Novello nominations under his belt. Beyond that, it’s fair to say that his film and TV scores are too numerous to mention, although in 2017 he was honored with an “Annie Award” for his score for the animated picture “The Little Prince” which he co-wrote with his long standing friend and collaborator, Hans Zimmer, following on from the success of his much praised contribution to The Da Vinci Code movie featuring Tom Hanks.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=ALU0013&medium=phydig,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Piano,United Kingdom,2018 SML Studios LLP under exclusive licence to Altus Records,2018 SML Studios LLP under exclusive licence to Altus Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He was renowned as a Beethoven interpreter, perhaps the greatest before Schnabel, and his Liszt performances bear the imprimatur of the composer. All the electrical studio recordings he made, plus the remaining Liszt acoustic ones, are included. Frederic Lamond, who came from an impoverished family, had his first lessons in music from his brother David; nevertheless at the age of fourteen he managed to make his way to Frankfurt where he enrolled at the Raff Conservatory, receiving piano lessons from Max Schwarz. He then became a pupil of Hans von Bülow, who suggested he continue his studies with Liszt. For the last two years of the composer’s life therefore, from 1885, Lamond became a pupil of Liszt. His Berlin debut took place on November 17, 1885, and after debuts in Vienna and Glasgow he made his London debut in a series of recitals. Lamond’s affinity with the works of Beethoven was something almost spiritual. “I longed for pureness, truth, simplicity. Beethoven was my god – the creed of my life – my one and all. Through continually absorbing his wonderworks I began to regard the practical side of life, that which gives pleasure to the majority of human beings, with repugnance.” A pamphlet by Lamond on some of Beethoven’s piano works, published in 1944, is headed with the quotation: “Haydn is the way to Heaven, Mozart is Heaven itself, and Beethoven is the God therein.”",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=APR7310&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,France,2018 APR Ltd,2018 APR Ltd,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Michele Mascitti was a protagonist of this remarkable change. The young violinist moved from Naples to Paris where he spent most of his long life and managed to publish nine collections of instrumental music between 1704 and 1738. The extraordinary success and popularity of Mascitti’s works allowed him to live for many years as a free-lance musician and to be applauded and admired in the artistic circles of the French capital. His music brings us back to the fashionable and refined atmospheres of the Parisian aristocratic salons and to the galanterie so beautifully illustrated in the paintings of the time. The violin sonatas recorded for the first time in this album blend the brilliant and passionate expressivity emanating from the Neapolitan legacy with the elegance and grace of the French instrumental tradition and offer an exquisite example of the new union of tastes.,,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=A111&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,France,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This album features two Lucerne concert recordings from the 1950s, issued here for the first time, featuring the violin concertos of Felix Mendelssohn and Antonín Dvorák, displaying ""Nathan the Great"" at the height of his art. Milstein had a particular fondness for Dvorák's A minor concerto: in his performance of August 1955, conducted by Ernest Ansermet, the music is ablaze, everything is highly charged. The Mendelssohn concerto was another favorite which Milstein recorded several times. His Lucerne performance of August 1953 alongside kindred spirit Igor Markevitch seems unusual even today. Milstein's tone is piercingly intensive, relentless, unsentimental and yet consumed with grief: high-octane music-making. Added to that are fast tempi, a sinewy tone and razor-sharp accuracy in the realization of filigree figurations. All this seems positively modern. But for exactly that reason Milstein met with a sense of disconcertment from certain contemporaries. Although considered ""capable of magical things upon a violin"", his playing was also, at times, regarded as overly cool.

Andrea Lucchesini is one of the leading Italian pianists of our day. His triumph at the Dino Ciani International Competition at a young age marked the beginning of his international concert career. He has since performed all over the world with leading orchestras under renowned conductors as well as in solo recitals. His primary interest lies in contemporary music. Berio's Echoing Curves was premiered by Lucchesini, and he was also involved in the composition of the Sonata, Berio's last work for solo piano. Since 1990 the pianist has increasingly devoted himself to chamber music as well, performing in many different instrumental combinations and particularly in close collaboration with the cellist Mario Brunello and the Quartetto di Cremona.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=6&v=7tbYiEtXIME,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=AUD97704&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Piano,Germany,2018 Ludger Bockenhoff audite Musikproduktion,2018 Ludger Bockenhoff audite Musikproduktion,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By that time, some of his masterpieces, including the Moravian Duets and the Stabat Mater, were starting to gain wider recognition- but the encounter with Brahms, which would stabilize him as an artist and clarify his musical tendencies, only took place the following year. Thus, many passages in this trio seem to be groping for direction: as Dvorak specialist John Clapham once remarked, they are still musically “insecure.” Still, certain traits in this trio already seem to reveal Dvorak’s profound affinity with Brahms on an instinctive level. Gradually emerging from a series of brief motifs, the first movement’s main theme is subjected to thematic treatment throughout. This movement is also the longest, lsating a total of twelve minutes. Its generally gloomy, somber mood does not yet reflect the true personal style of he who would soon write the Slavonic Dances. Notwithstanding, certain cello cantilenas in the slow movement and towards the end of the violent scherzo offer a foretaste of the great melodic gifts that Dvorak would soon reveal to the world. The Trio is coupled here with Joseph Suk’s Piano Quartet in A Minor, op. 1. A student of Dvorak, Suk’s piece shows a distinctly personal style almost completely separate from the style of his teacher.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=AVI%208553404&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Germany,2018 Avi-Service for music Cologne/Germany,2017 Deutschlandradio / Avi-Service for music,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This extraordinary collection of English sacred music from the early Renaissance reveals a striking diversity and range of stylistic structures, harmony, sonority, ornamentation and improvisation, and brings to light two world premiere recordings- Walter Lambe’s Gaude flore virginali and John Browne’s second setting of the Salve regina. The collection’s title derives from a dual meaning: the “door to paradise” is the English translation of a line from Browne’s O regina mundi clara, while the cover image features the “Alice Door” between the Deanery and Cathedral Gardens of Christ Church, Oxford, featured in Lewis Carroll’s Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=AV2395&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Choral,Austria,"2018 The Choir of Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford",Christ Church Cathedral Choir,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mirror in Mirror marks her 36th studio album and is one of her most personal projects to date. With the exception of Ravel, Anne collaborated with all of the composers and arrangers on this album. Several of the works were written for her. The music is reflective and spiritual, and weaves a compelling story. Philip Glass’s Metamorphosis II is heard in an arrangement commissioned by Anne. The original version inspired Fratres by Arvo Part, whose Spiegel im Spiegel (Mirror in Mirror) provides the album’s title. John Corigliano’s Lullaby for Natalie was written to commemorate the birth of Anne’s first daughter. Anne has commissioned numerous works by Jakob Ciupinski who combines acoustic instruments with electronics in Edo Lullaby- a modern setting of a traditional Japanese melody that Anne recalls from her childhood- and Wreck of the Umbria which conjures the composer’s dive and discovery of the ship off the coast of Sudan. Ciupinski contributes electronic to Ravel’s Tzigane, recreating the sound of the original version’s lutheal.

Dahlhoff’s collection is by far the biggest compilation of eighteenth century popular dance music in German-speaking countries. Johann Heinrich Dahlhoff (1704-1764) was himself a village musician, most probably a fiddler, from a village of Dniker, Westphalia, where he served as a churchwarden in an Evangelical church. Among his duties there was being in charge of an entertainment for local gathering, which usually came down to dance parties, where he picked and performed a suitable repertoire. This way, in the course of a few decades, a collection was born, consisting of a couple of thousands of dance melodies, written down later on by his son- Johann Dietrich. A whole set, comprised of 10 volumes (over 1400 pages) is kept in Staatsbibliothek Preussischer Kulturbesitz in Berlin. Polonaises from Dahlhoff’s collection (and only those) were copied by Niels Dencker (1887-1963), Swedish folklorist, teacher at Asa folkhogskola in Skoldinge. In his research, he worked mainly on traditional music. He did extensive recordings of folk musicians. Dencker, aware of Polish roots of Swedish traditional music, in 1931-32 did an extensive research of music archives on historical territory of Rzeczpospolita and her fiefdoms like Livonia, Gdansk, Prussia Duchy, Pomerania or Mecklenburg.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=AYCD03&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

(Yves Bernard, Le Devoir) Montreal-based ethno-classical Duo Beija-Flor explores the Spanish and Portuguese influence on classical music with COSTAS, their vibrant debut for Big Round Records. Charles Hobson and Marie-Noëlle Choquette form a highly expressive, versatile duo that is a force to be reckoned with. The twenty-two tracks on COSTAS appear to be bite-sized, but not only do they span a vast repertoire, they also pack a powerful punch individually. When Astor Piazzolla's only non-tango piece (Escualo) is contrasted with traditional Spanish folk songs (Siete Canciones Españolas) and motion picture soundtracks (Summer Garden Suite), it's not far-fetched to call this selection eclectic. All the more astounding, then, is Duo Beija-Flor's ability to tie this diverse program together, making it sound as if these pieces had always gone hand in hand. Occasionally, experimental elements are allowed in and incorporated into the flow of the album, such as the temporary, modernist dissonance in Boulevard San Jorge or the jazz harmonies in Havana Street Parade. And naturally, mirroring the dualist nature of the set-up, contrasts abound, not only in instrumental timbre and dynamics, but also in the music's character: Thus, the cheerful sweetness of Pé de Moleque and Quebra Quiexo (both aptly performed according to their title referencing Brazilian candy) is abruptly cut short by two dramatic fados pondering nothing less than the value of life. COSTAS attractively meanders between the light-footed and the profound, and the album's finale, Four Sephardic Songs, forms a majestic and evocative conclusion to an hour of music that is as vivacious, colorful and multi-faceted as the performing duo itself.",https://youtu.be/4g1qw2OvE0I,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=BR8953&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Contemporary Era,,,2018 Big Round Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We are talking contemporary music here, but not the gritty kind. Here beautiful melodies blend with modern means of expression; music that has its root in the Norwegian folk music treasure. The composer himself participates with his well-loved melodica and there are several instrumental soloists as well. This is a worthy continuation of the Norwegian Soloists’ Choir’s contribution to the recording of worthwhile music. The Norwegian Soloists’ Choir is one of Norway’s leading ensembles in any genre and among the foremost chamber choirs in Europe. The choir is equally at home in the classical/romantic repertoire and in contemporary music, making regular excursions into folk-derived music and National Romantic works. The Choir was founded in 1950 by the composer Knut Nystedt, who was its conductor for forty years. In 1990 he was succeeded by Grete Pedersen, who remains the choir’s artistic director to this day.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=BIS-2341&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Choral,Sweden,2018 BIS Records,2018 BIS Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Why they were written remains a mystery, and no one knows whether Mozart ever heard them performed during his lifetime. The symphonies in G minor, K. 550 (no. 40), and C Major, K. 551 (no. 41, also known as “The Jupiter”) are the ones that most represent Mozart’s symphonic legacy to later generations of musicians. As early as 1800, the popular ""Great"" G minor Symphony was praised as the “painting of a passion-stricken soul”. Like its big sister, the ""Jupiter"" Symphony in C Major, it numbers among the most-played works in classical music and has been immortalized in countless recordings. Nevertheless, these symphonies - probably the most profound ones before Beethoven - reveal themselves as something quite new in every interpretation. ""Mozart placed all the dark sides of human existence into his G minor Symphony"", says Herbert Blomstedt, adding that its “passion” continues to fascinate him. The eminent Swedish conductor Herbert Blomstedt, a close associate and regular guest conductor of the Symphonieorchester des Bayerischen Rundfunks, conducted the G minor Symphony in concerts on January 31 and February 1, 2013 and the ""Jupiter"" Symphony on December 21 and 22, 2017 in the Herkulessaal of Munich’s Residenz.

It examines the border between two different genres: the Lied, in its extended form as a song cycle, and the symphony. And as ever in Mahler’s music, that border is anything but black and white. The work certainly differs radically from a mere song cycle: the Lieder are permeated by symphonic techniques and some symphonic movements are built up from huge stanzas. Interludes expand to become development sections in which important things happen. Indeed, the thematic events take place in the orchestra, and, in a certain sense, the soloists also form a part of the interwoven orchestral texture. The sequence of movements also follows that of a symphony: In the weighty outer movements one clearly notices sonata form shining through the stanza structures, and symphonic processes are obviously taking place. Two inner movements take the place of the slow movement and sarcastic scherzo. The entire work is spanned by a taut arc, culminating – in accordance with the principle of intensification – in a huge final movement lasting as long as all the others together, and entitled Der Abschied (The Farewell). Here, Mahler is continuing the genre of the “Finale Symphony”, and the brightening of C minor to C major is even reminiscent of his usual apotheoses. In this symphony, as in his others, Mahler wanted to ""create a world using all existing technical means.” The formal design of the work is unique, and the demands it places on its performers are extreme. It requires two highly experienced Lied singers, who in combination with the huge orchestral apparatus have to be able to perform as soloists while blending into the symphonic structure as concert voices. An excellent and well-coordinated body of sound is needed here, and of course a highly competent conductor to ensure cohesion and to give spirit and soulfulness to such a large-scale work.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=BRK900172&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Avant-Garde,Germany,BRmedia Service GmbH,BRmedia Service GmbH,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

His remarkable talent was immediately evident, to the extent that by 1843 he was already travelling throughout Europe on concert tours, accompanied by his father. It was Franz Liszt who described him as ‘a Paganini of the Cello’, presenting him with an Amati instrument as a token of his admiration. Piatti’s concert-tours culminated in a visit to London, where he settled in 1846. In the mid-1800s, musical life in the British capital was full of energy and opportunity. When Verdi learnt that it would be Piatti leading the cellos in the first performances of his new opera, I Masnadieri, he wrote a Prelude consisting of a cello solo with an orchestral accompaniment, which he dedicated to the great cellist. In his own compositions Piatti reconciled virtuoso figurations with a highly lyrical approach to melody which is on show here in two of the songs he wrote for English audiences: O Swallow, Swallow (to a text by Alfred, Lord Tennyson) and La Sera (‘I love the hour of the dying day’), an evening-time, sentimental ballad incorporating a cello solo clearly modelled on the opening of Rossini’s William Tell Overture and astutely calculated to tug at the heartstrings of his well-to-do patrons, who would also want to perform such songs themselves. However, the bulk of Piatti’s music was designed to show his own skill as a cellist to best advantage. This he triumphantly did with the stupendously virtuosic Capriccio Op.22 on a theme from Pacini’s Niobe. The better-known Capricci Op.25 are not included here; instead, the opportunity has been taken by Andrea Noferini to record some of Piatti’s lesser-known, standalone pieces such as the attractive Op.1 L’abbandono, and Notturno Op.20.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=BRI94975&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Germany,2018 Brilliant Classics,2018 Brilliant Classics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The soloist and composer (1778-1837) who had come as a child to Mozart for lessons in Vienna then became a teacher of note in his own right, and an exponent of a fluid, filigree keyboard technique that exercised its own significant influence upon early generations of Romantic composers. Hummel ‘as a youth … was the most surprising performer that had ever visited, except the young Mozart’, reported one English piano manufacturer, and in this absorbing album of his sonatas, the composer’s voice is extended and developed in parallel with that of the instruments he used. We are still a long way from the massive concert grands ubiquitous today when we experience Hummel’s music on the instruments he would have known himself, and this is a uniquely attractive feature of Costantino Mastroprimiano’s interpretations. On this recording he plays a pair of instruments: a fortepiano by Urbano Petroselli, after an original model by Anton Walter ca.1790; and an original Erard ‘en forme de clavecin’ dating from 1838. The six sonatas on this set range from the Baroque formalities of Op.2 No.3 to the four extensive movements of Op.106, with a first movement in particular laid out on a spaciously expressive scale. This album is a worthy successor to Mastroprimiano’s notable achievement in recording for Brilliant Classics the complete sonatas of Muzio Clementi, another keyboard pioneer in the early decades of the 19th century. Reviewing volume 1 of the original series, Fanfare magazine reported that “With his fluid, brilliant technique and sensitive expression, Mastroprimiano serves Clementi beautifully, as does the excellent sound reproduction.” Volume 3 was praised in similar terms: “Costantino Mastroprimiano plays with crisp accuracy... He wisely doesn’t overplay his hand... This is a fine recording.”",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=BRI94378&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Germany,2018 Brilliant Classics,2018 Brilliant Classics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this, the sixth volume, Belder focuses on the compositions of John Bull, one of the main contributors to the collection. Principally an organist and organ-builder, Bull left behind a variety of attractive pieces whose charm is belied by the way he often presented himself as a Doctor in music, which might suggest a rather scientific approach to composition. Nonetheless, his Ut Re Mi Fa Sol La, one of the longest and most challenging pieces in the manuscript and reminiscent of Tallis, is appropriately complex, beginning with two-part writing and adding additional voices as it progresses, while employing numerous tempo changes and cross-rhythms. In contrast to the prolific Bull, the remainder of the recording features a host of composers who appear only a few times in the manuscript. Other than Orlando Gibbons, one of the most important of all virginalists, the other contributors are less well known, and many have obscure or undocumented lives. The repetition of such forms as the pavan and alman across the set, however, allows the listener to make a number of interesting comparisons. Pieter-Jan Belder is not only a consummate performer but also a serious scholar of keyboard music from the Elizabethan and Jacobean eras. His research on the Fitzwilliam Virginal Book has led to a highly informed performance practice. Belder specializes in performance on historical instruments, and he has carefully selected three period harpsichords for this recording in order to create the most authentic sound possible. The listener is rewarded with a substantial set that highlights the superb achievements of the composers of this era, laying the foundations of keyboard music for centuries to come.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=BRI95458&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Germany,2018 Brilliant Classics,2018 Brilliant Classics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The narrative in both cases is drawn from an Old Testament tale of over-reaching military ambition, corrupted power, valorous young generals and a noble queen. Scarlatti’s oratorio of 1705-6 is no less absorbing in its way for all that Scarlatti respects the conventions of his genre rather than (unlike Verdi) subverting and remaking them anew. With only one other recording ever made, this studio account was warmly welcomed when it was first released in 1999. It is reissued here as the fifth in a series of albums dedicated to the major vocal works of Alessandro Scarlatti, masterminded by Estévan Velardi, a scholar-conductor who has done much to advance our understanding of this prolific yet under-appreciated master of dramatic narrative at a time when the genre of opera was still in its infancy.‘Under Velardi, who uses his own edition, part II unfolds with a sense of palpable doom, from the broad opening sinfonia to the empty triumph of Nabucco's soldiers at the final curtain. As Anna, Alessandra Capici projects a womanly, compelling figure, whose broadly detailed grief becomes profoundly moving as she and Sedecia join in mourning the death of their son. In Ismaele's death scene, unfolded over a slowly moving ground bass, soprano Rosita Frisani displays admirable breath control and a sense of the realism that renders the da capo conventions of the aria strangely appropriate to the moment.’ (Fanfare)",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=BRI95537&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Germany,2018 Brilliant Classics,2018 Brilliant Classics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The owner and primary scribe was this Jan, or Johannes, of whom very little is known or can be surmised, but the contents of his book are a treasure trove of compositions and musical instruction illustrating what keyboardists of the region in the 16th century would have learned and played, including counterpoint, composition, organ-tuning, liturgical music and — perhaps richest of all — intabulations (arrangements) for keyboard of polyphonic vocal music from across Europe and original compositions for keyboard including 'preambula' (improvisatory preludes) and dances under the generic title 'corea' or with more specific names, several of them Polish. These latter Polish dances give the very international Jan of Lublin collection strong ties to its Polish origins, shedding light on the local musical tradition and its vigorous artistic interaction with Greater Europe. Internationally acclaimed harpsichord and recorder virtuoso Corina Marti has grouped selections from the Tablature into a recital programme in five sections, reflecting both the great variety and juxtaposition of various types of music in the volume, and the richness offered by this place and moment in music history.

Bach copied them out, and was supposedly influenced by them in his English Suites. The suites were probably composed in 1701, whereas these less familiar sonatas are considerably later works, dating from 1717: we don’t know when Dieupart was born, but a contemporary biographer records that he died ‘far advanced in years, and in very necessitated circumstances, about the year 1740.’ Dieupart spent his entire career working in and around London as a harpsichordist and composer: He was a prominent member of the musical establishment in Drury Lane though he later became a founding and popular member of the orchestra in a rival establishment, the Queen’s Theatre in the Haymarket. It was probably once he had become a private music teacher in his later years that he wrote this highly attractive set of six sonatas, which are dedicated to Lady Essex Finch (d. 1721), the member of a noble English family who was likely a student of Dieupart and would have paid for the sonatas. Even if Dieupart had not advertised himself as a ‘scholar’ of Arcangelo Corelli’s, his recorder sonatas betray the influence of the great Roman violinist and composer in the types of movements, the varied support of the bass, and an elegant simplicity. The dance movements often have an English flavour that is reminiscent of Purcell, but otherwise Dieupart’s French heritage predominates in the lively formality of his melodies.

The two trios for violin, cello and piano are early works, written at the time he was studying in Munich, or shortly afterwards. The first Trio in D major dates back to 1896, was premiered at the Tonkünstlerverein in Stuttgart in September of that same year and published as Op.5 in 1902 by Leuckart in Leipzig. The four movements of Op.5 abound in richly embroidered, Brahmsian melodies and impassioned statements and developments, free of the naivety that is often a feature of early works. That said, they do embody a certain innocence, a degree of gentleness, even a lightness of spirit that sets them apart from their composer’s study of German models with teachers such as the organist Joseph Rheinberger. Parts of the Op.7 Trio may in fact have been written before Op.5, but the expression of the three-movement work as a whole is more individual, dominated as it is by a huge opening movement (almost 20 minutes in length), and often colored by a bitter chromaticism that Wolf-Ferrari would later relinquish in favor of a more light-hearted and lyrical idiom. Here is a technically gifted young composer stretching his creative muscles – and for all the breadth of expression, his writing for the notoriously tricky combination of instruments is notably sympathetic, allowing the two string instruments to flourish without being overwhelmed by the piano. This new studio album is the second recording of Trio Archè for Brilliant Classics after their well-received debut of trios by another Italian composer, now even less familiar than Wolf-Ferrari, Marco Enrico Bossi.

In total, they constructed an estimated 400 organs. Costanzo Antegnati was perhaps the most influential member of the family, and his set of 12 ricercars – the centrepiece of this recording – was published alongside his treatise on organ tuning and registration. The compositions were of such high quality and popularity that they were subsequently included in the Intavolatura d’organo tedesca, the most extensive manuscript source of keyboard works known today, containing a good 1,770 pieces by composers from Italy and Northern Europe. Interwoven between Antegnati's pieces are works by other composers of the same period. Notable among these is Anton Holzer's three canzoni, of which this is the first complete recording, and Agostino Soderini's Canzon La Ducalina, a fascinating short piece in which the keyboard writing closely follows the pronunciation of a virtual text and at times sounds like poetry being recited. Federico Del Sordo is a renowned continuo player who has devoted himself for more than 15 years to the study of the alternatim repertoire.

Here Gounod – finally noted more for his neoclassical pastiches (Le Médecin malgré lui and Cinq-Mars) and his ardent Romanticism (Faust and Roméo et Juliette) – was given an opportunity to display his talents as an orchestrator and colorist in an exotic setting.

His first foreign tour took place in the spring of 1951 when, at the invitation of Sir Thomas Beecham, he took the Royal Philharmonic on a tour of England to coincide with the 'Festival of Britain' that year. It was during this tour that he also made his first appearance with the BBC Symphony Orchestra in a Royal Festival Hall concert that included Beethoven's 7th Symphony and Stravinsky's Rite of Spring. During the next couple of years Stokowski performed many works with the BBC Symphony in a Maida Vale studio programme which included two full-length radio broadcasts.

It was Tchaikovsky's 5th Symphony that he played the most, having conducted it for the first time in Cincinnati in 1910.

This is their fifth work for orchestra over the course of nearly two decades; starting with Decasia in 2001, the two developed a style that combined Gordon’s haunting, hypnotic music with Morrison’s artful manipulations of old, deteriorating film reels to craft a dreamlike experience that's by turns whimsical, nostalgic and inspiring. Co-commissioned and performed by the Seattle Symphony, The Unchanging Sea takes it direction from Gordon's electrified concerto for virtuoso pianist and multimedia artist Tomoko Mukaiyama. While the title and visual source material originate with a 1910 short film by silent era director D.W. Griffith, Morrison’s film includes footage shot in Seattle in 1897, when the S.S. Willamette sailed out of Puget Sound loaded with 800 passengers and 300 horses headed for the Klondike, at the height of the Gold Rush. The album includes the companion piece Beijing Harmony, also performed by the Seattle Symphony. Inspired by a visit to the Echo Wall at Beijing's Temple of Heaven, Gordon ""imagined that the sound would bounce off the stone floors and buildings to create a fanfare of echoes — an acoustical rebounding and ringing that would slowly grow in zeal and fierceness.""",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=CA21141&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Orchestral,United States,2018 Cantaloupe Music,2018 Cantaloupe Music,,24,Bill Morrison; Michael Gordon; Seattle Symphony,,1,,2018 Cantaloupe Music,US,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nobody knew anything about George Enescu’s oratorium Strigoii. The script, lost together with other items in the turmoil of the First World War, was purchased back by the Director of the Enescu Museum. To make it easier to understand how Strigoii was created, it was necessary to undertake the decipherment and reconstruction of the manuscript. When Enescu approached Strigoii in 1916, it was the result of an older admiration for the poet Mihai Eminescu that was to last until the end of the composer’s life. Whilst Enescu evinces some similarities to German Romanticism in his poem (Novalis or Tieck), in Strigoii Enescu also shows stylistic affinities to some contemporaries such as Alexander von Zemlinsky or the young Alban Berg.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6v1SF4A8s0,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=C5346&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Oratorio,Austria,2018 Capriccio,2018 Capriccio,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He turned to Wolfgang Rihm. ‘I replied’, Rihm said in an interview with Die Zeit: ‘There’s only one thing: the final scene from Schlusschor by Botho Strauß.

After considering the first orchestral manuscripts, the maestro, known for his openness and great erudition, encouraged the young man to expand his musical career. Several pictorial projects came to Nagano’s mind, which he entrusted to Beintus’ musical imagination: first, Wolf Tracks for recitator and orchestra (recorded with the speakers Bill Clinton and Michail Gorbachov), for which Beintus was awarded a Grammy in 2004, before in 2008 writing for the family concerts of the German Symphony Orchestra in Berlin a suite on Antoine de Saint-Exupéry’s omnipresent The Little Prince.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=C5337&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Contemporary Era,Austria,2018 Capriccio,2018 Capriccio,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These subtly contrast with Mendelssohn’s genially flowing energy. While Op. 44 No. 3, which incorporates many deft variations, developments, and combinations, follows an extended honeymoon tour and Mendelssohn’s twenty-ninth birthday, Op. 80 emerged from a bout of helpless depression after the sudden death of Mendelssohn’s older sister and confidante, Fanny.

If most of these etudes are made up of a Prelude paired with a Fugue, their variety offers the album great diversity, and unveils the compositional genius of Antoine Reicha: here are unexpected moods and textures, sophisticated canons, cheeky invertible counterpoint, chaconnes and minuet-like character pieces, even a piece the only unifying characteristic of which seems to be its tumbling scales in dotted rhythm. Ilic’s unique interpretations are supported by enlightening booklet notes, written by the pianist himself, shedding light on revelatory moments in the composer’s life. While the musical world will soon become saturated with celebrations of the 250th anniversary of the birth of Beethoven, his friend and exact contemporary Antoine Reicha will enjoy a renaissance with this unmissable series.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=CHAN%2020033&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,United Kingdom,2018 Chandos Records Ltd,2018 Chandos Records Ltd,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Piano is a constant protagonist in the extensive work of the Salzburg master. The context of Piano and Orchestra Concerts is the music style which most defines Mozart as an instrumental music composer. The “Piano Concerto K. 271 E flat”, named “Jeunhomme”, creates new perspectives in the context of Piano Concertos, pointing out how the composer had abandoned that particular style, typical of his era, in order to dictate a new taste which had to be particularly original. Some musicologists consider the K. 414, despite the number, as the first Piano and Orchestra Concerto ever written by Mozart in Vienna. After the first movement, which is lively even though not that exuberant, comes the second one which appears as tribute to melodrama and to his dear friend Johann Christian Bach. A sense of joy comes in the end of this work with the final “allegretto.” The interpretation of these masterpieces is by Andrea Bacchetti, the world famous pianist from Genova, and the Orchestra of Teatro Carlo Felice di Genova, directed by Fabio Luisi, one of the most valued Italian directors in the world.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=CD2106&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Italy,WORLD MUSIC soc. coop.

Liszt described Sgambati as an “extraordinary and genuine artist,” Richard Wagner recommended his works, and European heads of state decorated him with medals. Although the dates of this Rome native lay rather precisely between those of Verdi and Puccini, he did not compose a single opera and as a composer endeavored to develop a style that would blend the cantability of his fatherland into the structural landscapes of the German romanticists.

At the young age of twelve Mendelssohn composed Twelve Fugues for String Quartet (1821), and in his String Quartet in E flat major composed shortly thereafter a fugue forms the finale. Such contrapuntal pieces pointing to Johann Sebastian Bach were regarded as proofs of compositional proficiency. However, this work was in no way an object of study merely copying classical models. The adagio alone with its melancholy, emphatically intensified melody and quartet texture finely spread over all the instruments radiates a new and very unique sound magic. What is remarkable about Mendelssohn’s Quartet op. 12 is the lyrical character of the first movement, which quite obviously engages in dialogue with Beethoven’s late Quartet op. 127 in the same key. Of course the individual tone of the composer, who was a mere twenty years old at the time, is also very clear. His Four Pieces for String Quartet are not a homogeneous work, even if after his death they came to be known as his String Quartet No. 7 op. 81. The four movements are from different periods of time: the variation movement and the scherzo from 1847, the year of his death, the capriccio from 1843, and the concluding fugue from as early as 1827.

His work catalogue registers almost two hundred opus numbers representing practically all the important musical genres. Stylistically, Lachner was influenced by Beethoven and Spohr, by Meyerbeer, and above all by Franz Schubert. His music is distinguished by a sovereign command of form and above all by counterpoint. This month cpo is releasing the world premiere recordings of two of his symphonic works. Lachner composed his Symphony No. 3 between the spring of 1833 and April 1834, and after its premiere it was enthusiastically received and reviewed. The Vienna correspondent of the Leipziger Allgemeine Musikalische Zeitung celebrated the work emphatically as the “bold product of an imagination of youthful fire moderated by the laws of eternal truth and beauty; a conglomerate of harmonic art and melodic delightfulness, an appealing interplay of pathos and melancholy, of mirth and yearning, of gloomy lament and triumphant jubilation. Everything, however, is spun with golden threads of ordering unity and firmly guiding clarity.” This work lasting approximately fifty minutes may be extraordinarily long, but its length does not come from redundant passages or unnecessary repetitions. Instead it is the logical consequence of a formal architectonic design operating with generously dimensioned thematic blocks such as they again are encountered – of course much more strictly elaborated – in the symphonies of Anton Bruckner. The Festive Overture in E flat major, which remained unpublished, is dated “22 February 1864” in the autograph. Although the autograph does not indicate a specific occasion for the Festive Overture, its composition might have had something to do with the wedding of Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria and Duchess Elisabeth of Bavaria.

Glière had just written his second symphony and presumably motivated his young pupil to compose his Symphony in F sharp minor, which was premiered with remarkable success by the Berlin Philharmonic. “He already has something to say; he has thoughts and ideas,” as the Signale für die musikalische Welt wrote at the time, and in fact more compositions followed, which – without a cramped quest for originality – represented the very best of modern music. Even then the theosophical movement showed van der Pals a path to follow in the future; its German exponent Rudolf Steiner greatly impressed him, and when Steiner founded the Anthroposophical Society, he espoused this new idea in much of his creative work. His special relationship with nature and its constant changes led to the composition of works such as the two symphonic sketches Frühling und Herbst op. 14 (Spring and Autumn). This highly atmospheric music of individual character situated between neoromanticism, impressionism, and the ecstatic poems of Alexander Scriabin displays the same remarkable organic power and instrumental mastery that also makes the poetic study of the soul in Wieland der Schmied op. 23 (Wieland the Smith) an absolutely fascinating listening experience.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=555117-2&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Orchestral,Germany,2018 cpo,2018 cpo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At the end of the seventeenth century England’s theater world was shaped by the defensive stance of traditionalists toward influences from the Italian opera and the magnificence radiating from the French court. The English counterproposal, the “English opera,” was a combination of the “heroic play” with musical inserts ranging from individual songs, as already during Shakespeare’s time, to “all-sung masques,” little operas with pastoral content, works-within-the-work related at the most associatively to the framing action. During the Restoration period the old court form of the masque was hardly more than a name, often to be understood as synonymous with “interlude” or “musical entertainment.” The Mad Lover is a good example of the English opera. On this recording song inserts from other masques are added to this comedy by John Fletcher from 1647. Anne Bracegirdle was so very successful with compositions by John Eccles that she later exclusively sang works by him. Once the authors of the texts had recognized that moods and changing passions could be expressed much more easily with music, the logical move was to have these musical inserts increasingly develop from simple songs to a form similar to the cantata. The so-called mad song, in which the most impassioned feelings could be depicted very vividly, was the most popular form.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=555061-2&medium=phy#,01 Classical,Classical,,Germany,2018 cpo,2018 cpo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The action of the tragic opera is based on the true-life story of the Queen of Cyprus. Political intrigues and great passions distinguish the plot. It is difficult to believe that this musically so very appealing work, which captivated the audience at Munich’s Prince Regent Theater already with its highly atmospheric overture during the performance on which this album is based, ever could be forgotten. “With this opera the German school has been enriched with a dramatic work that has to be counted as one of the most genial and magnificent of the works belonging to it.” This is what the Allgemeine Musikalische Zeitung wrote after the premiere, and Max Zenger’s Geschichte der Münchner Oper of 1923 documents the pathbreaking effect of this opera when it states that Catharina Cornaro had “quite literally become Munich’s hallmark, like the two towers of the Cathedral of Our Lady.”",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=777812-2&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Opera,Germany,2018 cpo,2018 cpo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

His numerous pupils did their special part to spread his fame. German musicians like Johann Kaspar Kerll, Johann Philipp Krieger, and Christoph Bernhard, who had stayed at the Collegium Germanicum while in Rome between 1650 and 1660 and were under Carissimi’s tutelage, contributed significantly to the Italian’s renown. Today Carissimi is also regarded as one of the most significant representatives of the new oratorio form. Some of his works have been transmitted with more than one title; most them are assigned the “Historia” label and treat the prophetic books of the Old Testament, including Ezekiel and Jonah, as well as the sapiential book of Job. Musicologists currently accept thirteen of these oratorio compositions as authentic works by Carissimi, who clearly preferred subjects from the Old Testament. The texts of the Latin oratorios are rarely taken word for word from the Vulgate but instead tend toward paraphrase. To make the action intelligible to the faithful and to enliven it for them, Carissimi employed a wide range of highly effective stylistic means.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=777489-2&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Germany,2018 cpo,2018 cpo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He is probably best known for his operas, but also wrote chamber music and over 60 works for harpsichord. These keyboard compositions, which he wrote between 1706 and 1728 and spread over three volumes, differ greatly from the style of his contemporaries. Rameau’s intellectualism and technical brilliance of composition, allied with passion and tenderness combine, in his words, to produce ‘true music… the language of the heart’. This release features pieces from three of the four suites Rameau wrote for the harpsichord. Virginia Black has selected these to illustrate Rameau’s extraordinary talent in descriptive, innovative and often virtuosic writing, and to show how the piano can enhance the works through singing tone and tonal nuance.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=CRD3536&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Piano,United Kingdom,2018 CRD Records Ltd,2018 CRD Records Ltd,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present album included passionate research by pianist Angelo Arciglione and violinist Eleonora Turtur, to gather in this release interpretations of various, almost unknown pages for piano and for violin and piano solo.

This ""musical journey"" starts with piano pieces composed before leaving Italy. The other works presented date back to the years after the exile, with the evocation of exotic and Californian landscapes or Hollywood movie stars.

He was a dignified and solitary person with a serious approach to music, single-mindedly following the course of his artistic convictions without compromise. Scarpini also had an incredible talent for memorising music – indeed, this concerto recording was performed entirely from memory. The formidable 20-year partnership of the Bavarian Radio SO and their chief conductor Rafael Kubelík, was one of the greatest musical relationships. This legendary performance by Scarpini, Kubelík and the Bavarian Radio SO is enchanting, beguiling and wonderful. At last, this live recording is available for the first time on modern means.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=FHR64&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,United Kingdom,2018 First Hand Records,2018 First Hand Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EMI started to record in stereo in 1954 and all the recordings in this new series are from this historic period of recorded music. All the releases will appear for the first time in some form and feature many of the greatest classical artists of the time. Included in this first issue is Richard Strauss' Till Eulenspiegel, a recording which, for some reason, was never released on LP or any other format before this FHR release. This recording, with the LSO conducted by Norman Del Mar, is in fact, the earliest known surviving EMI stereo recording of a complete work. Paul Tortelier’s was a star cellist for HMV and was the most charismatic of an exceptional generation of French cellists. Tortelier gives an athletic account of this 'lost' stereo recording of Saint-Saëns Cello Concerto No. 1 and Menges supports him admirably. There is an extraordinary difference between the well-known mono recording, and this stereo version, where the soloist is much more sympathetically placed within the orchestral texture. In the Brahms Violin Concerto, Hungarian Endre Wolf displays an effortless, fine style and lovely tone free of the wide ‘Hubay vibrato’ affected by many of his compatriots.

The accordion was introduced in Bulgarian folk music in the 1980s. There is no accurate information about who imported the first instrument in Bulgaria. Initially, the musicians played with their right hand only. Later they added the bass tunes (left hand) in their playing and although European harmony is not characteristic of our folk music, it was introduced into the performances of the groups created at that time, which consisted of an accordion, a clarinet, a violin ... These ensembles quickly became popular on the folk music stage and a lot of similar formations were created within a brief period, for example the orchestra of Ramadan Lolov, Radi Angelov, Karlo Iliev, etc. In most of them the accordion plays the leading role. After the 1940s, the instrument was already considered as a “folk” instrument and the musicians employed the characteristics of the Bulgarian folk regions in their manner of performing.

Between times this inspirational musician and his orchestra recorded a series of orchestral suites drawn from the opéras-ballets, tragédies en musique and pastorales-héroïques, first for Philips and then for the orchestra’s own imprint on Glossa. These eight suites have now been united by Glossa for the first time in a magisterial and richly-enjoyable demonstration of Frans Brüggen’s empathy with the output of the Baroque composer from Dijon. From Les Boréades to Les Indes galantes, from Acante et Céphise to Zoroastre via Castor et Pollux, these suites – originating in scrupulous scholarship by orchestra member Wim ten Have – together represent a pillar in the modern revival and appreciation of the music of Rameau, which was dear to the heart of Brüggen and so many of the other early music pioneers of his generation.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=GCD921125&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Netherlands,"1987, 1990, 1994, 1998, 2001 note 1 music gmbh",2018 note 1 music gmbh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Composed around the same time as the Violin Concerto (No 1), the C minor Piano Trio and the Second Cello Sonata (Nos 2 and 3), they also echo some of his songs, such as those written to poems by Klaus Groth. Into this Romantic atmosphere come new performances of the three works on Glossa, played by violinist Leila Schayegh (particularly fêted for her recordings of Bach, Caldara and Benda), teaming up here with pianist Jan Schultsz. Schayegh plays a copy of a period violin, whilst Schultsz uses an original 1879 Streicherinstrument. The two players aim to recapture the performing tradition as the composer would have known it, and within which he would have intended his pieces to have been played. Schayegh and Schultsz worked with Clive Brown and Neal Peres Da Costa in their efforts to aim for “the spirit rather than the dead letter of the score” and they pay admirable notice of important interpretative questions for music of this time – and they provide an intuitive musical and emotional response to the lyricism of the first two sonatas and the darker-hued tones of the third, investing these late-nineteenth-century works.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=GCD924201&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Austria,2018 note 1 music gmbh,2018 note 1 music gmbh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Björn Schmelzer draws a vivid connection between the florid polyphony of these two composers and the freedom of structure and ornament found in late Gothic architecture, notably that of the fourteenth- century Lady Chapel built as part of the “Ship of the Fens”, Ely Cathedral. Performing Ashwell’s intricately-woven Missa Ave Maria – a landmark in polyphony – Schmelzer and his Antwerp-based ensemble echo, in the individual freedom accorded to these virtuoso singers, the rich ornamentation of foliage, seemingly in constant motion, decorating the walls of Ely’s Lady Chapel. The singers add their own “coloratura”, an approach which continues to be central to Björn Schmelzer’s interpretation of medieval and Renaissance works, as have been appearing on Glossa for a decade and a half now. In his booklet essay Schmelzer refers to the British writer and artist John Ruskin describing the “liberation of the Gothic” as also concerning “the workers, who were not submitted to repetitive, mechanical work but invested in continuous and infinite variation.” Acting as surrounding pillars to Ashwell’s Mass on this recording are two of the extended motets, much favoured by early Tudor English polyphonists – and encountered in the famous Eton Choirbook manuscript: John Browne’s Stabat mater and his first setting of the Salve regina.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=GCDP32115&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Austria,2018 note 1 music gmbh,2018 note 1 music gmbh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The diversity of the genres and themes that he explored in musical form in them can be viewed as a lyrical diary mirroring his life as a composer.

Tchaikovsky’s aim in his Romances was to express emotions directly and simply and to make them accessible to all listeners. He allowed his own very personal feelings to provide the backdrop to his songs, by concentrating on one dominating psychological motif in the lyric template, which provided him with the suitable musical intonation.

The fact that romance in music encompasses much more than the so named epoch makes many of the compositions from different centuries and their interpretation by outstanding artists, which are presented in this series, palpable. Listen to that in the concert presented here. The fact that even Baroque composers put a lot of emotion into their most formal rigorous compositions can be experienced during this festive Advent programme. The concert, titled “Royal Christmas- Joy To The World,” provides an insight into the music culture at the English court during the Baroque period, when all kinds of musical art in Europe were unthinkable without the king’s and ruler’s role as patron of the arts. The German landgraves of Hessen-Homberg has also encouraged arts. But above all, they have left us with the castle church in Bad Homburg vor der Hohe.

He has not regarded his task as that of inventing his own musical language, but prefers rather to find inspiration in experiments with form and in using the old language in new ways. Important sources of inspiration are traditional folk music (from Norway and abroad), as well as impressions from nature, birdsong in particular. The latter can be found in works such as “Fugler I min natt” (“Birds in My Night”), “24 fugleportretter” (“24 Bird Portraits”) for piano, and “Ornis musicalis.” Gaathaug has devoted special attention to particular turn-of-the-century artistic currents around 1900 associated with composers Sergei Prokofiev and Borghild Holmsen, as well as with poets such as Ragnhild Jolsen, Rainer Maria Rilke, and Sigbjorn Obstfelder. This was a period of upheaval, in which modernism pushed forward with many new forms of artistic expression. Yet at the same time, it was important to maintain a connection to the past, renewing the traditional tonal foundation. On this recording Norwegian mezzo-soprano Marianne E.

The performance marked the end of Matre’s engagement as the season’s featured composer. “Concerto for Orchestra” is, as the title implies, a work for orchestra, but it is also a work about the orchestra. As in a number of works with the same title, all instrumental groups are properly explored and challenged. But in studying the names of the movements, one sees that the work explores overlapping meanings between “concert” and “concerto.” Very many orchestra concerts have the same structure: an overture, a solo concerto, an intermission and a symphony. “Concerto for Orchestra” follows this format. The overture presents material on which the rest of the piece is based; Herresthal plays extracts of Matre’s violin concerto, which also exists as an independent work; and the four movements “preSage revisited,” “Lament/Berceuse,” “Minuet” and “Finale” can be considered in this context as constituting a small symphony. For the first performance of this work Matre approached the concerto form as a physical and social space. The recording attempts to communicate something of this experience via the medium of recorded album by using audience sound from Oslo Concert Hall and a recording of Arne Nordheim’s iconic pre-concert bell composition from the same hall. Orjan Matre has distinguished himself as a distinct voice in Norwegian music and has, in a short time, been awarded high-profile commissions from leading musicians, ensembles and orchestras.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=LWC1155&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,,2018 Lawo Classics,2018 Lawo Classics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Completed in the summer of 1958, the resulting score is dedicated to Elinson, who gave the first performance of the work with the Hallé Orchestra under George Weldon on January 11, 1959 in the Free Trade Hall, Manchester. In keeping with Joubert’s instinctively symphonic approach to large-scale forms, the concerto is more of a sinfonia concertante than a bravura vehicle for pianistic display. The idea for a musico-dramatic work based on Charlotte Brontë’s novel Jane Eyre originated in the early 1980s, when the composer took early retirement from the University of Birmingham. This was a labor of love which he embarked upon unprompted and without the security of a commission. Dedicated to the opera’s librettist Kenneth Birkin and his wife Inge, Symphony No.3 on themes from the opera “Jane Eyre”, Op.178 (2014-17), reworks the five orchestral interludes as five symphonic movements.

Oistrakh’s road to music was a permanent and steady ascent to the musical Everest. He was recognized as a top violinist many years ago when the Soviet arts entered the international scene for the first time. Among the numerous celebrated violinists that the previous century gave to the world, David Oistrakh held a unique place. “Oistrakh is great not because he is a virtuoso, but because he is a genuine, inspired musician”, wrote the press during his first visit to the USA in 1955. It is known that Oistrakh had to play his first recital at Carnegie Hall on the same day when Nathan Milstein and Mischa Elman performed in New York. Thanks to Oistrakh’s intensive concert and studio activities of forty years, the number of his recordings is incredible. The violinist’s repertoire covered music of three centuries – from Corelli and Tartini to Honegger and Shostakovich. This set features recordings that captured the versatility of Oistrakh’s performing genius – from early phonographic records of the 1930s, when his triumphs at competitions in Warsaw and Brussels made him a world class performer, to the never before released recital of December 1972 when the artist performed onstage despite his serious heart disease. These are also ensembles pieces with Konstantin Igumnov, Sviatoslav Knushevitsky, Abram Diakov and the legendary Beethoven Quartet; sonata cycles with the outstanding Lev Oborin and Frida Bauer who were Oistrakh’s partners of many years; and the recital of February 1962 with the Moscow Philharmonic conducted by Kirill Kondrashin. What makes this set particularly special is the recording of Dmitri Shostakovich’s sonata made together with the composer at his home in 1968, on the eve of the official premiere.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=MELCD1002555&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Russia,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Extending from the melancholic forms of 19th century composer Eric Satie to the dark, moving compositions of the pianist herself, this album invites listeners into the realms of the past, the war-torn images of her homeland, and a look into the immense possibilities for the musical future. Victory and War are the first of Brankovich’s own compositions, but with her sharpened technique combined with an emotional drive, the pieces play like those by a seasoned composer. The works are directly inspired by melodies heard during her childhood in Serbia and the dramatic choral elements found in the Kosovo region. Her melodies refer to “the screams of the lost souls that vanished in the wars during the 90s in the Balkan region.” These compositions are dedicated to the innocent victims of violence during that dark time in her homeland. Throughout the album, Brankovich intertwines Serbian and Western techniques with her own experimental style. The piano is stretched to limitless sonic possibilities thanks to Brankovich’s application of phrasing, tension, and mood. The solo pianist fills the soundscape effortlessly, allowing chords and melodies to linger. This is especially present in Božic’s Lyric of Athos and Mansell’s Lux Aeterna, originally composed for the 2000 film Requiem for a Dream. The album also consists of works by acclaimed composer and professor Fredrick Kaufman, Metamorphosis and Yin and Yang. Kaufman’s compositions provided key inspiration for Brankovich’s debut album, and she is joined on Yin and Yang by the notable pianist and scholar Kemal Gekic. The “Black Swan” pulls listeners into each composition with her spellbinding command of the piano.

Hahn, currently the Principal Flutist for the Calgary Philharmonic Orchestra, is rightly known for her refined and beautiful tone, and I Close My Eyes In Order To See indubitably attests to this. But extraordinarily, there is even more to Hahn's musicianship: An exquisite ability to get right into the heart of a composition. No doubt this is in part due to the highly personal selection of pieces: The album's eponymous opening track, I Close My Eyes To See, was dedicated to Hahn by composer Arthur Bachmann, written to commemorate her mother's hard (but eventually successful) battle with cancer. Indeed, the compositions of this album center around perhaps the greatest, and most universal, challenge of the human condition: overcoming Fate's hardships. In this spirit, the individual musical pieces represent emotions such as fear, sadness, the desire to bargain, and depression and anger are reached with the help of mental fortitude and spirituality – all culminating, inspiringly, in acceptance and optimism. Sara Hahn's interpretation of these wildly diverse sentiments is nothing short of riveting and, towards the album's cheerful conclusion, supremely uplifting. In this sublime feat, pianist Laura Loewen and alto flutist Sarah Gieck, who both accompany with fitting delicacy, add great musical depth.

In this album, Mohajer shares his artistic upbringing by combining his roots in Persian modality with his love of Western classical music. The eponymous piece, a set of five songs for voice and piano, feature the works of the Persian poet Hafez. In the multi-tiered composition, Mohajer draws from childhood memories of his mother’s singing. Used with Hafez’s poetry, which adores a superior spirit called “Beloved,” Pictures of the Hidden reaches towards a higher meaning, honoring the perfection of an all-powerful Spirit. Each song, sung in Persian by soprano Raeeka Shehabi-Yaghma, brings a motherly passion to the depth of Hafez’s poetry. With Karolina Rojahn on piano, the composer combines the story-like motifs and counterpoint of Bach-inspired piano composition with the brilliant virtuosity of Shehabi-Yaghma. In Reng, Mohajer shares the conventions of his native music. The dance , for instance, is built on a syncopated 6/8 rhythm characteristic of Persian dances throughout history. The dance signals a release, a giving up of self to the joy of music and movement. The album concludes with a stunning performance by the acclaimed Alexander String Quartet, who communicate the contrasting feelings of melancholic longing and swift energy - a task perfect for strings and their ability to produce sound across the dynamic spectrum. Though the album is Mohajer’s debut, Pictures of the Hidden is more than just an artistic expression of self. Rather, the album celebrates the past figures who shaped his present context, and demonstrates how art can leave humanity in a better place for having experienced it.",https://youtu.be/zB7F1ppDVbI,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=NV6180&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Chamber Music,,,2018 Navona Records ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Quadrants Volume 2 seeks to bring the emotive works of six contemporary composers together, with each work communicating both deeply personal and universal messages. These messages are made all the more potent when expressed through the multifaceted voice and intimate setting of the string quartet -- in this case, the acclaimed Boston group, the Pedroia String Quartet. The Pedroia String Quartet brings a combined fresh energy and maturity to the Quadrants series. Each member is a master in his own right. Between the four performers are tours from London to Seoul, the founding of one of America’s freshest new chamber ensembles, “A Far Cry,” and countless awards and features with the world’s greatest ensembles. Put all of this together in one quartet, and you get the idea. Establishing themselves as one of the top contemporary string quartets, The Pedroia Quartet brings the work of Navona’s composers to life with a spirit that is intense and virtuosic while remaining sensitive and tender. Quadrants Volume 2 is only the second stop in a series of composers and performers of the highest caliber.

Veil’s chronological track order allows the listener to follow the progression of both the music and the man behind it. Veil and Thread are D'Alessio's early chamber works, very much reflective of the conviction and clarity characteristic of the young composer, built on a thoughtful yet passionate blend of traditional structure and instrumentation with experimental effects. Enter Sono Solo and the turmoil begins. Befitting the meaning of their Italian title, Sono Solo paints an accurate, solemn portrait of solitude, a soulful, introspective lament that is not without instances of enlightenment and self-assurance. Now's the Time picks up with a higher energy level, intertwining jazz rhythms and harmonies with D'Alessio's ever-present pursuit of a carefully constructed, airy musical architecture. Elements of it are still experimental – but now with the greater determination of a matured composer. After Ending forms the transcendent climax of the album. The two-part work contrasts a profoundly lyrical first movement with a strongly rhythmic finale reminiscent of Shostakovich's late symphonies. They, too, harken back to the stark contrast of the D'Alessio's early work, but now with the aplomb of someone who's confident that he has achieved mastery in his field. What stands out about Veil is the astonishing ease with which two opposing concepts are reconciled: The diversity of modern composition in its widespread applications, and the profoundly personal, individual journey of a singular composer.",https://youtu.be/ZtDM_28t9v4,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=NV6181&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Chamber Music,,,2018 Navona Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Discover the answer in Art for Two, a collection of works by acclaimed composer Arthur Gottschalk and performed by Italian woodwind extraordinaires Sauro Berti and Mario Ciaccio, accompanied by the skilled hands of pianist Naomi Fujiya. In each piece, the performers call listeners into the moment as they traverse art music inspired by sources from traditional Jewish hymns to Frank Zappa. The melodies of Berti and Ciaccio will carry listeners to some interesting and unexpected places. Italian bass clarinetist Sauro Berti has performed at major festivals from China to Mexico, and his command of the woodwind has earned him credit with the most notable orchestras in Italy and beyond. His counterpart, the award-winning saxophonist Mario Ciaccio, adds smooth flair -- together, the two mesmerizingly work off of each other as the strains of their instruments sing together as one. In the first piece, Benny, Zoot, and Teddy, one can almost hear witty banter back and forth between the instruments. Two best friends strolling through a lively city scene as they converse immediately comes to mind. The album’s concluding piece, Shalom, also features the two instruments in conversation, but this time with a different message. They are joined by a full choir to deliver a final word: “shalom,” a Hebrew word meaning “peace.” This message, balanced with the exchange of the woodwinds, sends listeners on their way, enriched with having joined the musicians on this journey. In Art for Two, each track brings listeners into a different shared conversation and experience. Enjoy the intimate dialogue between two musicians, and between the performer and you, the listener, as each song tells you a new, fascinating story.",https://youtu.be/o_Cc7YVAm1g,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=NV6185&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Contemporary Era,,,2018 Navona Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Though artistic development is present throughout the larger timeline of the album, each composition demonstrates innovative approaches to time and repetition. These innovations reflect a desire to not only learn and understand time, but master it. String Quartet No. 1 and String Quartet No. 2 may have been composed 20 years apart from each other, but Dr. Kam’s approach to each composition shares a nucleus: repetition. The differences are subtle at first. The former employs a non-tonal, modernist arrangement reminiscent of 1960s post-Webern music, while the latter focuses more on pitch centricities and implied tonal relations. Dr. Kam’s cyclical patterns generate a sound distinctly his own. Similarly, Sonata No. 1 and Sonata No. 2 share a unique approach to time while retaining their identities in pitch orientation. At only eight years apart, the two sonatas sound closely related, yet each carries a unique motion that draws one into the breathtaking piano performance. The arresting compositions compel listeners to work out the intricacies of time and repetition -- if they can. As timeless as Dr. Kam’s compositions are to himself, so too are they to listeners. Whether you consider String Quartet No. 1 from the mid-60s to D-Bop: Sonata No. 2, the compositions characterize the unique style of Dr. Kam from his past to present, and hint at what is to come in the future.",https://youtu.be/8HKKjuYlUl4,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=NV6179&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Chamber Music,,,2018 Navona Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Symphony No 1, his first purely orchestral score, established his international reputation. Structurally unconventional- it opens, unusually, with a passacaglia- it illustrates his principle of ‘progressive growth’ through its sustained lyricism and towering, chorale-like statements. Metaboles was inspired by the virtuosity of the woodwind section of George Szell’s Cleveland Orchestra. Distinctive instrumentation for each movement allows for deep expression, jazzy rhythms and moments of irony. The enigmatic diptych Les Citations quotes from fellow composers Benjamin Britten and Jehan Alain. After over 40 years at the head of the Orchestre National de Lille (ONL), of which he was the founder, Jean-Claude Casadesus enjoys an international career that has brought seasons in Germany, Russia, Japan, Latvia, and in Lille.

A large orchestra is used sparingly in chamber-like textures with motivic ideas that evolve over the course of the work. The result is music of gripping and unsettling power, both emotionally intense and architecturally complex. Some years earlier Weinberg wrote the light-hearted Serenade, Op. 47, No. 4 which offers a study in contrasts: by turn capricious, rumbustious and wistful. The Siberian State Symphony Orchestra has a reputation as one of the best orchestras in the former Soviet Union.

Written by journalist and reformer Henry Mayhew, a founder and editor of the satirical magazine Punch, it collects hundreds of testimonials from the lower strata of Victorian society. We encounter street entertainers, ‘pure finders,’ cabinetmakers, gingerbread sellers, ‘screeve-fakers,’ swindlers and burglars. We hear accounts from toshers finding items in sewers, people attempting to train pigs to dance, and witness the sale of everything from gilt watches and chickweed to needles, dog collars and eel soup. It is a remarkable work, said to have inspired the socially conscious fiction of Charles Dickens and William Makepeace Thackeray, who described it as ‘a picture of human life so wonderful, so awful, so piteous and pathetic, so exciting and terrible, that readers of romances own they never read anything like to it.’ David Timson’s sharp-witted and authoritative tone perfectly suits Mayhew’s detailed social observations.",https://soundcloud.com/naxos-audiobooks /labour,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=NA0319&medium=phy,15 Spoken Word,Spoken Word,,United Kingdom,2018 Naxos AudioBooks,© 2008 Wordsworth Editions Ltd.

These musicians are crafting a new body of work that embraces once disparate corners of contemporary performance practice- the conventional technical demands of complexity scores; the specialized vocabulary of multiphonics, key clicks, and other percussive techniques, and the performative elements of spoken, sung, and intoned vocal sounds. Formed in 2009, Ogni Suono is committed to expanding the repertoire for saxophone duo by collaborating with living composers and offering diverse and adventurous programming to new audiences.

Its allusions to Russian folk music made it a loyal response to the 'Great Patriotic War', but its incorporation of style elements of the sacred and klezmer music of Eastern European Jewry, historically oppressed within Russia and Eastern Europe, took its implications further afield. By including aspects of Jewish style, he may have desired to express his sympathy for the persecuted Jewish people, especially when news broke in 1944 of the atrocities carried out at the Treblinka concentration camp, built and operated by Nazi Germany in occupied Poland during WWII. While staying in Batumi, Georgia in late October/early November 1931, he adapted in one evening two short movements from earlier works as a gift to the Jean Vuillaume Quartet. His beautiful Elegy for string quartet is derived from Katerina Ismailova’s aria 'The foal runs after the filly' in Act I, Scene 3 of Lady Macbeth, which he completed in its original version in 1932. The Polka derives from Shostakovich's first ballet The Golden Age Op. 22 (1929-30), which dramatizes the visit of a Soviet football team to a decadent Western European city. The footballers are subjected to various indignities, including imprisonment, but they are eventually freed when the working classes revolt against their bourgeois rulers and the ballet ends with a dance of solidarity between the footballers and the workers. Kissin's String Quartet is a fitting companion to Shostakovich's works on this disc, not least because both composers' musical language has much in common. The work is modernist, starkly constructed but deeply communicative and it comprises an eclectic mixture of styles that appertain to Kissin's life and career.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=NI5970&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Chamber Music,United Kingdom,2018 Wyastone Estate Limited,2018 Wyastone Estate Limited,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This new release by the Finnish Radio Symphony Orchestra conducted by its chief conductor Hannu Lintu includes world premiere recordings of two new works by Magnus Lindberg: orchestral work Tempus fugit and Violin Concerto No. 2, featuring Frank Peter Zimmermann as its soloist. This release also celebrates the composer’s 60th anniversary. Violin Concerto No. 2, written for Frank Peter Zimmermann, was composed during Lindberg’s tenure as the composer-in-residence for the London Philharmonic Orchestra. This three-movement work represents well Lindberg’s late lush orchestral style and is reminiscent to the tradition of great romantic violin concertos of the past. The concerto has three movements played without a break, with a solo cadenza towards the end of the second movement. The music is at times lucid and bright and at times lusciously sonorous, and the soloist is called upon to display both fireworks and soaring melodic arcs. Tempus fugit was commissioned by the Finnish Radio Symphony Orchestra and premiered at the gala concert for the centenary of Finland’s independence in Helsinki in 2017. Although the work has a strong positive and even lucid fundamental tone, the composer did not seek to write a traditional anniversary piece. Instead, he sought a new approach through means that he had first employed in the 1980s, going back to the harmonic studies that he had undertaken on computer, using the LISP programming language – the same that he had used when creating his first major orchestral work, Kraft (1983–85). The result, however, is quite different from his edgy, even aggressive, early works: Tempus fugit is a 30-minute orchestral work embracing an Impressionist brightness of color, melodic lines and a warm Romantic glow.

Through performance, teaching and outreach, the Tesla Quartet has for ten years strived to tap into this palpable feeling, using music to create meaningful connections with their audiences. Celebrating this first decade together, the quartet’s debut album draws upon the need for reflection, and to look upon the familiar in a new light. None did this more effectively than Igor Stravinsky, two centuries after Haydn pioneered the string quartet, and Ravel’s masterful contribution takes its place as a staple of the repertoire. Praised for their “superb capacity to find the inner heart of everything they play, regardless of the era, style or technical demand” (The International Review of Music) the Tesla Quartet brings refinement and prowess to both new and established repertoire.

This album features both sides of Strauss’s musical persona with the Burleske in D minor as well as Ein Heldenleben. While the former is a playful, miniature quasi concerto for piano and orchestra, the latter epitomises Strauss’s symphonic style: majestic, virtuosically orchestrated, full of grand ideas, but never without irony. In that respect, Ein Heldenleben has more in common with Burleske than one would expect. Strauss’ arguably satirical self-identification with the hero of his symphonic poem is underlined by recurrent self-quotations from previous compositions. The central role of the solo violin makes it another solo concerto in disguise, albeit less overtly than Burleske. These two remarkable pieces are performed by the Netherlands Philharmonic Orchestra and their chief conductor Marc Albrecht, with Denis Kozhukhin delivering the solo piano part in Burleske. Albrecht and the Netherlands Philharmonic Orchestra have released acclaimed albums such as Mahler Song Cycles with Alice Coote (2017) and Mahler’s Symphony No. 4 with Elizabeth Watts (2015). Kozhukhin has recorded piano concertos by Ravel and Gershwin (2018) as well as Tchaikovsky and Grieg (2016), and has been extensively praised for his Brahms Ballads & Fantasies solo album (2017).",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=PTC5186617&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Orchestral,Germany,2018 PENTATONE,2018 PENTATONE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Imagine the late bloomer from Busseto, who was just working on his first opera, and was considering all possible text sources – it might be conjecture but not completely absurd to see a first, tentative approach to Goethe with the pieces “Meine Ruh ist hin” (“My peace is gone”) and “Neige, neige, du Schmerzenreiche” (“Lean down, you who are full of sorrow”). It may be only postulation, but consider if we had lost not just the planned King Lear, but a Faust as well...! The second volume of six Romances (1845) is more colorful and varied, as humorful and melancholy strains alternate. The gloomy yet beautiful evening scene “Il tramonot” (“The Sunset”) [16] stands next to “Zingara” with its bolero rhythms and musically blazing eyes [3], and next to the desire of the prisoner for the freedom of the lovely evening star (“Ad una stella”) [15]. After that, in the cheery chattering of the “Spazzacamino” [2] (“The Chimneysweep”), it’s easy to understand why his harmonies in three-quarter time aren’t all that elegant: “I look coarse and black, and everyone who gets too close to me gets black as well...“ At the end, Felice Romani’s glowing ode to his wife (“Il mistero”) [17] leads on to a sparkling paean to wine: apparently both are cardiotonic medicines, if we are to believe the last words in each.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=PH14033&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Germany,2011 telos music,2018 Profil Medien,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But the curiosity stayed in my head and I could not stop thinking about what might be on this cassette tape. I finally went out and purchased a new cassette tape player.

Using altogether conventional harmonies, he cleverly employed changes of register (which were incomparably more effective on historical pianos than on modern ones).

This album of highly original piano compositions invites the listener on a voyage through mysterious realms where the limits of the sensual and the intuitive dissolve – a journey that is at times epic, and at other times epically quiet. The album commences with Three Pieces for Piano (2006), a modernist mélange whose gamut ranges from dissonant serenity to rhythmic agitation. They're perfectly, intimately rendered by pianist Jeri-Mae G. Astolfi, who performs the entirety of Journeys with great clarity, structural insight and precision, never losing touch with the primal, emotional appeal of the compositions. Swirling Sky (2014), dedicated to the pianist, displays the collaboration between the performer and the composer at its most fruitful. Martin has sculpted and captured the peculiar sensation of looking at clouds in the sky with seeming effortlessness; Astolfi performs them with a paradox combination of lightness and depth that is most appropriate. The album's namesake and centerpiece, however, is the recent, eleven-piece piano cycle Journey, composed in 2015-2017. In more traditionalist terms, one might call this ""variations on a theme"" – and one would fall horrendously short, considering the vast artistic and psychological scope of the work. The starting point, Soul, whose main idea centers around a humble minor third, is subsequently transformed in the most diverse of ways: The motive appears, recognizable but ever-changing, in deep sorrow in Lament, desperate to the brink of madness in Vexed, collected in Revelation, and cheerfully delusional in Manic. Eventually, a new thought – Conviction – leads to a Metamorphosis and ultimately culminates in the final Transcend, the cycle's (and album's) musical catharsis.",https://youtu.be/virFZcLjrow,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=RR7995&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Piano,,,2018 Ravello Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Inspired by sources from the Beatles to the poetry of Rinehart’s wife, the album creates an intimate aural experience that is as personal to the listener as it is to the artist himself. The title track, composed by Michael Karmon, is named after a book of poems by Rinehart’s wife Janice Notland. Karmon animated six of her poems with thoughtful, evocative compositions. Contrast this with composer John Oliver’s Ancient Heroes Suite. Oliver, inspired by ancient music conventions, worked with dance-oriented rhythms in experimental time signatures that recall melodies resonating through ancient halls, while filtering them through a modern context.Variaciones Sobre un Tema de Juan Lennon, written by New Brunswick composer Richard Gibson as a wedding gift for his daughter Julia, reimagines parts of a song originally written by John Lennon. Exploring shifts in key signatures, major and minor modes, and alternate harmonization, Gibson takes the pop song and breathes his unique perspective into it. The album is rounded out with works by two more well-established Canadian composers. Guitarist-composer William Beauvais contributes his improvisatory and rhythmic Beginning of the Day and Vancouver's David Gordon Duke explores the full range of guitaristic colors in his Soliloquies and Dreams.

Grabmusik was reported to be the product of a test set by the prince of Salzburg, who: “... not crediting that such masterly compositions were really those of a child, shut him up for a week, during which he was not permitted to see any one, and was left only with music paper, and the words of an oratorio ... During this short time he composed a very capital oratorio, which was most highly approved of upon being performed.” Performed for Holy Week the title can be translated as ‘Cantata on Christ’s Grave’ (literally ‘Grave Music’), and the anonymous text takes the form of a dialogue between a tormented soul, who is desperately lamenting the tragedy of Christ’s death, and an angel. Bastien und Bastienne is the only one of Mozart’s operas to have been written for performance in a private house rather than a theatre. Commissioned at some point in mid-1768 by the renowned and controversial German physician Franz Anton Mesmer, it tells the tale of two young shepherds, Bastien and Bastienne, being reconciled in love the fortune teller and magician Collas after Bastien has briefly been lured away by the attractions of a noble lady from the city. This new recording is uses Mozart’s original 1767 setting of the libretto by F. W. Weiskern & J. H. F.

Both composers see themselves as traditionalists who want to create something new in proven forms. There is, on the one hand, the genre of a young composer who, early on, too soon as a harbinger of hope, mercilessly fails the work. And second, the work of a regionally recognized talent, which can attract the attention of the great German music world before his untimely death. Trained from the age of seven by the Basle pianist Albert Engel, the Swiss-Hungarian pianist Andrea Kauten became a finalist at the Jecklin Competition in Zurich at 13 and won first prize at the Swiss Youth Music Competition one year later before enrolling at the Basle Academy of Music. A scholarship from the Federation of Migros Cooperatives Switzerland then enabled her to continue her studies at the famous Franz Liszt Academy of Music in Budapest. This opportunity, and the brilliant combination of technique and expressivity she admires in Liszt’s music, have left an indelible mark on her playing.

With the intent of uniting and giving value to the two authors’ works for guitar, we collected Desderi’s complete works for solo guitar and made a first world recording of their two beautiful works for voice and guitar, which were composed within only a few years of each other: Desderi’s Due Cacce quattrocentesche (1955) and Castelnuovo- Tedesco’s Vogelweide, Ein Lieder-Cyclus op. 186 (1960). If Castelnuovo-Tedesco is universally known for his contribution to the guitar repertoire, Desderi still needs to be rediscovered and appreciated. Born in Asti, he was a professor of composition in Bolzano and Milan - Castiglioni and Donatoni were among his students - Director of the Liceo Musicale of Alessandria and of the Conservatory of Bologna, a versatile composer, an essayist, a critic and a music promoter as well. He took a degree in architecture from the Polytechnic of Turin in 1920, and a second degree in composition with Alfano in Bologna in 1921. Moreover, he had the opportunity to study in Florence with Pizzetti. A short trip to Germany in 1928 brought him close to the International Sacred Music Association, of which he founded, in the same year, an Italian section.

It is a presentation of Classical Music through the lens of multi-Grammy award winning producer Russ Titelman and is a reimagining of traditional classical repertoire. The album has a clear narrative running parallel to a Blakean understanding of transcendence. In Blakean philosophy we enter life in a state of innocence at childhood and dwell within that realm until we experience; at which point our perception is altered. The state of Experience and the journey from Innocence to Experience is mirrored by the first half of the album’s repertoire. There are clear states of innocence in the Brahms and the Chopin, there is lightness to the Stravinsky with our rearrangement of it. We enter Experience at the middle of the album with the Bach Busoni Chaconne in D minor. The rest of the album is a journey through the doors of perception to reach the Blakean state of higher innocence which is a combination of Innocence and Experience. It is a chosen realm of living, reached through the doors of perception and having removed our mind forged manacles which in this case are our perceptions of how classical music is displayed and understood. Life and death, light and dark, are here brought together and spiral around each other lifting us to our goal that is a marriage of the two contrary states of the human soul. D minor as a key is often associated with death and demonic spirit and is the key of the Prokofiev Diabolical Suggestions, yet the Scriabin reaches E major, well associated with heaven. Even geographically E major and D minor couldn’t be closer together melocially, yet harmonically are the absolute opposite. The album ends with plates that I curated to form the explanation in text that Marianne Faithful reads over John Adam’s Phrygian Gates, the gates are being used synonymously with doors in order to take the listener through that transition.”",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=STE018&medium=phy#,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Piano,United States,2018 Suite 28 Records,2018 Suite 28 Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It contains a unique compilation of songs by the great German lied composers including Schubert, Schumann, Wolf, and others. The compilation provides a unique overview of Wunderlich’s lied performances – from the start of his career until his tragic and untimely death. The esteemed German tenor, Fritz Wunderlich was no doubt enveloped in music at an early age. Urged to pursue classical voice training by theater people who heard him singing as they passed the bakery where he worked, the young Wunderlich was granted a scholarship to the Freiburg Music Academy in Breisgau by the town fathers. He studied there from 1950 to 1955, also studying the classical horn, which explains his almost supernatural breath control. After playing Tamino in a 1955 student production of W.A. Mozart's Die Zauberflöte, Fritz Wunderlich was engaged by the Wurttemberg State Opera in Stuttgart. His first professional role was as Ulrich Eislinger in Die Meistersinger. When he was called to play Tamino for an ailing Josef Traxel, Stuttgart had a new star and Fritz Wunderlich's short but amazing career had begun. During the remaining decade of his life Fritz Wunderlich gained the highest respect as a W.A. Mozart singer, lending lyrical brilliance to J.S. Bach, Schubert and Gustav Mahler and melodic tenderness to Bel Canto and light opera roles. Following such greats as Tauber and Schmidt, Wunderlich also devoted a good part of his time to the beautiful songs of such compsers as Strauss, Lehár, Kálmán and Fall.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=SWR19064CD&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Art Song,Germany,1955-1965 SWR Media Services GmbH,2018 Naxos Deutschland GmbH,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On can’t see… I can’t see what could be created beyond Tristan.” The French intellectuals, especially musicians and writers, were captivated by the magic of Richard Wagner’s music and were frantically looking for ideas as to how things could go on after Wagner. Without doubt, all musicians were acutely aware of the fact that the possibilities of tonality, the key element that had united European music for 400 years, were exhausted. However, in France there was more at stake: In 1870 the conflicts between Germany and France had culminated in a war that the French had lost. Subsequently, removing the German element at least from art and culture and developing genuinely French music became a question of national identity. That is why, in 1871, Gabriel Faure and Camille Saint Saens founded the Societe Nationale de Musique which was to further the new French music. The programme on the present release was born out of this tradition, and is performed here by the SWR Vokalensemble.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=SWR19065CD&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Choral,Germany,2018 SWR Media Services GmbH,2018 Naxos Deutschland GmbH,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

How the three of us can be one.” This synergy of opposing impulses first makes a community of musicians into an organism that helps the sound experience, in itself abstract, produce a specific and ideally emotional effect. The small scale form of the trio has been from the beginning one of Anadolis’s preferred options. Even as a composer, he follows the idea of a breathing music that is based on the harmony of its elements. There are many moments of tonal subtlety which, in the fragility of the motifs, give the pelvic range of the percussion the opportunity to develop its own colors. There are also challenging passages where the piano, with its fascinatingly articulated runs and sound salvos, rises to become the dominant instrument, but without blurring its fullness in pathos. In this live recording of his trio performed in Heidelberg, Nikolas Anadolis makes an impressive statement.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=JAH-471&medium=phy#,02 Jazz,Jazz|Contemporary Jazz,,Germany,2014 SWR Media Services GmbH,2018 Naxos Germany GmbH,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The songs for voice and piano constitute one of the most sensitive means of showing how Casella managed to deal with a culture that placed the mélodie in the forefront, by surrounding it with the subtle reverberation emitted by the intertwining of music and poetry, over the background of a social custom that resounded with precious literary streaks.

He met many contemporary composers, one of whom was Robert Schumann, who praised him saying: “Since many years no virtuoso has given me such an intimate joy and such pleasant, happy moments as Antonio Bazzini has done.

Fittingly, it is the nearby Fort Wayne Philharmonic, in its own debut recording, that has made the first album of Bricht’s music. The recording reveals another major Viennese voice and points to yet another potentially important career cut off in the bud by the Nazis. Bricht was reportedly Franz Schmidt’s favorite student, and the late-Romantic styles of the two men are indeed very closely aligned in their mix of Baroque counterpoint, Classical form and Wagnerian chromatic harmony: Bricht’s Symphony in A minor might almost be Schmidt’s No. 5.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=TOCC0488&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Germany,Fort Wayne Philharmonic,Toccata Classics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2018,Toccata Classics,TOCC0418,5060113444189,Karl August Hermann ,Hermann: Complete Piano Music,Nicolas Horvath ,1,CD,14.81,22.99,"This year sees the centenary of Estonian independence. One of the main figures in the ‘national awakening’ in the half-century that preceded independence was Karl August Hermann (1851-1909). Hermann was indefatigable: he was a linguist, journalist, choir-leader, song-writer, historian, literary philologist, encyclopaedist and more. As a composer he is known only for his choral songs, but French pianist Nicolas Horvath has discovered the scores of his 26 surviving piano pieces. This first recording reveals them to be charming salon miniatures, blending echoes of Chopin and Grieg with the essence of Estonian folksong. Nicolas Horvath began his music studies at the Academie de Musique Prince Rainier III de Monaco. Known for his untrammelled musical explorations, he is an enthusiastic promoter of contemporary music: he has commissioned numerous works and collaborated with a number of leading contemporary composers, among them Valentin Silvestrov. He is also a rediscoverer of forgotten or neglected composers.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=TOCC0418&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Germany,Toccata Classics,Toccata Classics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Like Mahler, he prefers to write for large forces and now has ten symphonies to his name. Again like Mahler, Tabakov’s symphonies explore the darker side of the human spirit in epic scores as austere as they are powerful. Behind the plain title of Tabakov’s Concert Piece for Orchestra (1985) lurks an extraordinary explosion of violence and anger. The Fourth Symphony (1997) sandwiches a wild Bulgarian dance between two glacial slow movements, the second with an episode of Tchaikovskian lyricism at its centre; the finale is a dark, whirling moto perpetuo- a ride through hell. This is the third volume of a projected series of all ten Tabakov symphonies, most of them receiving their first recordings.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=TOCC0467&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Germany,Bulgarian National Radio,Toccata Classics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This portrait album presents two works by the multi-talented universal musician, both of which are parts of longer cycles and combine (one or two) soloists with orchestral groups. Polyphone Schatten (Polyphonic Shadows, 2001), from the cycle Lichtstudie (Light Study), is a synesthetic attempt to combine the musical phenomenon of polyphony with natural laws. The colors of the two solo instruments – viola (played by Christoph Desjardins) and clarinet (played by Jörg Widmann himself) – are contrasted and combined with noise-like, atmospheric sounds from the orchestral groups. Drittes Labyrinth (Third Labyrinth, 2013/14) unleashes a mystifying, schizophrenic dialogue. The soprano soloist (Sarah Wegener) wanders through the concert hall in dialogue not only with the instrumental groups of the WDR Symphony Orchestra, but also with an imaginary partner. It is a journey to the inner worlds of the sounds themselves.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=WER73692&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Orchestral,Austria,2018 Wergo,2018 Wergo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
