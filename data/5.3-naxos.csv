And now there is a follow-up: a new string quartet, two trio constellations and the song cycle ‘Do You Believe in Heather?’, which has given the album its title. Ståle Kleiberg is often called a ""modern romantic"", and for good reason. We encounter a distinctive and highly individual alloy of modern and romantic elements in his music, whether it is characterized by a still, meditative lyricism or an energizing vitality. His String Quartet no. 3 encompasses this entire range of expression. The music speaks of summer. It is imbued with joie de vivre, and was composed with a full command of the genre and with considerable virtuosity. The flute-viola-harp ensemble is less common, but by no means unknown. Following Debussy's Sonata, several trios have been composed for this ensemble, and Kleiberg's ‘Trio Luna’ is a fine and most welcome addition. The work's three movements capture the mood of three dissimilar outer and inner landscapes, all of them bathed in moonlight, albeit at different times of day and night. ‘The Light Smith’ is also a trio; it is a song cycle for mezzo-soprano, clarinet and piano, and is chamber music on a very high level of inspiration. Both ‘The Light Smith’ and ‘Do You Believe in Heather?’ are settings of poetry by the distinguished Norwegian poet Helge Torvund. These poems engage with such archetypal themes as light, quietude, love, death and nature, but they treat these themes as real, everyday experiences, rather than abstract concepts. While the theme of ‘The Light Smith’ centers on the beginnings, growth and culmination of life, it is autumn and winter we meet in ‘Do You Believe in Heather?’",http://www.2l.no/pages/album/152.html,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=7041888524427&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Chamber Music,Norway,"2L (Lindberg Lyd, Norway)","2L (Lindberg Lyd, Norway)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At the center of the cantata “Es erhub sich ein Streit“ is the tenor aria “Bleibt, ihr Engel“ (Stay, ye angels), which gives this recording its name. Embedded in these two magnificent, dramatic works with timpani and trumpets are two more intimate cantatas that sing the song of peace. In the introductory Sinfonia and the two alto arias of “Gott soll allein mein Herze haben“, the organ is highlighted as a virtuoso solo instrument - perfect for the Hildebrandt organ in the Naumburg Wenceslas Church, which lends a special color to this recording. The final chorale contains a message that can also be found in the subsequent solo cantata “Friede sei mit Dir“ and can be regarded as a statement of the entire program: “So that we love one another from our hearts and remain with one mind in peace.”",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=4260234831863&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Sacred,Germany,"2018 Accentus Music, Deutschlandfunk Kultur",2019 Accentus Music,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Giovanni Antonini, flautist and founder of the legendary Italian ensemble Il Giardino Armonico, enjoys musical voyages, the discursiveness of music. He begins with an anonymous 16th century pavane, La Morte della Ragione (The Death of Reason), which he believes refers to In Praise of Folly, in which its author Erasmus distinguishes between two forms of madness: ‘a sweet illusion of the spirit,’ and a negative form, ‘one that the vengeful Furies conjure up from hell...’ This succession of ‘musical pictures’ leads us to the threshold of the baroque era, starting out with the Puzzle Canon by John Dunstable (1390- ca.1453), whose manuscript is an enigma, via the ‘bizarre’ style of Alexander Agricola (1446- ca.1506) and his obsessive, ostinato rhythm – almost an anticipation of minimalist music…to the improvisatory freedom of the Galliard Battaglia de Scheidt (1587-1654), a battle piece involving a great many diminutions or ‘divisions’, a common technique of improvisation in the Renaissance...

The Trio in B flat major – the first that has survived – was composed in the spring of 1875, during a period when Dvorák was conceiving and consolidating a more conventional sense of musical form and style. The works of this remarkably prolific year show a distinct crystallisation of Dvorák’s mature melodic style. When the composer began work on his Trio in G minor, in January 1876, he was exhausted after the completion of his opera Vanda, and overcome with grief for the death of his daughter Josefa. He would certainly have known how, back in 1855, his elder colleague Smetana had turned to the genre of the piano trio in similar circumstances, to express his sorrow at the death of his own daughter.

Although inspired by its illustrious precedents, this work distinguishes itself in its strong theatrical character, derived from the author’s long experience in opera (especially comic opera), of which he was a leading figure until the mid-eighteenth century. His Stabat Mater thus seems to be a veritable synthesis of operatic style, whereby lengthy arias alternate with lively duets, and passages of almost folk origins alternate with very simple recitatives. Giulia Semenzato, soprano, and Raffele Pe, countertenor, are the protagonists of this important rediscovery. This album – the first monographic recording dedicated to the composer – includes a brilliant cantata for soprano as well as a concerto for flute (played by Marcello Gatti), a work that represents a precious addition to the repertoire for this instrument. The ensemble “Talenti Vulcanici”, under the direction of Stefano Demicheli, deliver an instrumental performance of stylistic coherence and calibrated virtuosity, following their successful recording, Arias for Nicolino (A427), praised by critics for its “theatrical tautness and élan”, and “a reliable sense of pacing, detail and texture”.

Three works on this release (Cherubini, Donizetti, and Shostakovich) can be heard performed by the Quartetto Italiano for the first time on this format.

With the present release he adds yet another chapter to his series of Bach’s works for solo harpsichord. After acclaimed recordings of the Well-tempered Clavier, the Goldberg variations, the French Suites and other works the turn has come to the English Suites. Composed while Bach was in his thirties it precedes other sets such as the French Suites and the Toccatas, and in his liner notes, Bach scholar Yo Tomita draws attention to 'the stylistic traits of a youthful and ambitious composer wanting to make his mark through the use of counterpoint and virtuosity'. Despite its title, the collection has very little to do with England, at least musically: the six suites are instead rooted in the French tradition, and show certain striking similarities to the composer Charles Dieupart’s Six Suittes pour le Clavessin from 1701. (Bach made a copy of Dieupart's set sometime between 1709 and 1716.) It was only in the 19th century that the suites became known as the 'English', based on a never substantiated claim that the set was commissioned by an English nobleman.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=7318599922812&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Baroque Era,EU,"2019 BIS Records AB, Sweden","2019 BIS Records AB, Sweden",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By name, Violin Concerto No. 2 is one of these, but it is fair to say that it straddles the divide. Pettersson himself remarked: ‘In reality my work was a Symphony for violin and orchestra. From this results the fact that the solo violin is incorporated into the orchestra like any other instrument.’ It should therefore not come as a surprise that Christian Lindberg has chosen to include this massive 53-minute work in his acclaimed and award-winning series of Pettersson’s symphonies, realized in collaboration with the Norrköping Symphony Orchestra. The concerto was written in 1977, 28 years after its predecessor, the Concerto for Violin and String Quartet (1949). In that work, written while Pettersson was still studying, the composer was experimenting with radical ideas that are not to be found in his later compositions. Concerto No. 2 is rather characterized by the central role given to one of Pettersson’s Barefoot Songs – a trait that appears in several other mature works. Throughout the score, the song ‘The Lord walks in the meadow’ provides motivic material but is also quoted extensively. The hugely challenging solo part was first performed by Ida Haendel in 1980, and is here taken up by Ulf Wallin, who with an extensive discography has already proved himself to be one of the most intrepid violinists of today. The album closes with Pettersson’s last musical thoughts: a 207-bar long fragment generally regarded and referred to as a sketch for the composer’s Seventeenth Symphony. The fragment has been performed in public on one or two occasions, but it is only now that a wider public is given the opportunity to hear it.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=7318599922904&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Modern Era,EU,"2019 BIS Records AB, Sweden","2019 BIS Records AB, Sweden",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is ironic, then, that his extensive and varied output isn’t better known today – except for a few works of which the most famous, Carnival of the Animals, is one Saint-Saëns himself had little affection for. Now often regarded as old-fashioned or even reactionary, we tend to forget that Saint-Saëns during his lifetime was sometimes heckled for the boldness of his works. Furthermore, he defended the music of the revolutionaries Wagner and Liszt, earned the admiration of figures as Berlioz, Debussy and Ravel and – in 1908 – composed one of the first original scores for a film! Jean-Jacques Kantorow and the Tapiola Sinfonietta have championed the music of Saint-Saëns on a series of acclaimed albums, and are now joined by the young Alexandre Kantorow – son of the conductor – for a survey of his works for piano and orchestra. In 1858, Saint-Saëns became the first major French composer to write a piano concerto, but on this first release of two the Kantorows present the three last concertos. Composed over a period of almost 30 years (1868 – 1896), these are highly individual works: Piano Concerto No. 3 is a bold attempt to reconcile Classical form with a Lisztian pianistic brio, No. 4 employs an unusual formal scheme in which themes are reused in a cyclic manner and, finally, the ‘Egyptian’ (No. 5), named after the second movement, which in the composer’s own words describes ‘a sort of Eastern journey that goes all the way to the Far East’.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=7318599923000&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Piano,EU,"2019 BIS Records AB, Sweden","2019 BIS Records AB, Sweden",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

His output includes works for a wide variety of musical formations, but the human voice is central to much of it. He combines a deep understanding of traditional choral sonority with a modernist fascination for extended techniques and structural rigor and a post-modern interest in the deconstruction of text. In his writing, Haapanen examines the full range of sound production available using the human vocal apparatus. We hear singing, of course, but also whispering, speaking, shouting, Sprechgesang, breathing sounds, whistling, lip smacks, tongue clicks, grunting as well as nasal tone and falsetto. Haapanen’s use of text is also far from traditional: he is as interested in words for their sonic qualities as he is in the meanings they convey, separating them into their individual phonemes or using similar-sounding words in quick succession to create a sonic image. The subject matter explored in these texts is varied, but notable in a number of Haapanen’s works is his interest in the themes of playfulness and of childhood – although not necessarily the innocent variety. The Helsinki Chamber Choir has a diverse repertoire, as shown on its previous, acclaimed albums for BIS which range from late Renaissance Christmas hymns via 19th-century Finnish songs to spring to 20th-century modernism. Particularly highly regarded for its work with new music, the choir under its artistic director Nils Schweckendiek here takes the step into the 21st century, and proves its expertise in a highly demanding programme.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=7318590024522&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Choral,EU,"2019 BIS Records AB, Sweden","2019 BIS Records AB, Sweden",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Within a few years, its educational policy had shifted to musical training and singing and during the 1600s it was home to the finest composers in the city. They transformed the rigidly austere musical geometry of northern Europe into something wholly new, as though infusing the darkness of the north with the immense, intensely bright light of the south. Nicola Porpora was just such a composer. In 1710 the 24 year-old Porpora presented his opera Berenice in Rome with great success. While in the city, Haendel himself saw it and went to congratulate its composer. Porpora wrote a great deal of music for religious purposes and opened a singing school which Farinelli also attended. Leonardo Leo is the other great composer from Sant’Onofrio. Almost a decade younger than Porpora, a combination of overwork and delicate health killed Leo at the relatively young age of fifty. He had already produced a number of new operas by 1738 when his reputation for music earned him the commission of a lifetime to write an opera to celebrate the wedding of Charles III and Maria Amalia of Saxony. Leo put everything else to one side and took as his subject the wedding of Psyche and Cupid. Yet despite the success of his opera for the imperial wedding, Leo continued to write music – both sacred and opera, whether serious or comic.

The Author’s interventions in 1932 were undoubtedly important: the little chorus of Zeffiri that after the short prelude announces the idyll shows a harmonic restlessness hardly thinkable in a twenty-year-old Mascagni; and the same goes for the unusual effect in the finale, with the two voices whispering a fading “T’amo” on the silence of the orchestra. Also, the rich instrumental ensemble is much wider than the one thought for the cantata. For the symphonic poem with voice A Giacomo Leopardi Mascagni followed the great examples of Liszt, Smetana and Strauss: the poem gets its inspiration not only from the few verses sung by the soprano; wider fragments - quoted in limine on the score - supply the expressive suggestions to the orchestra interludes acting as “bridges” among the different episodes. So we might say that this A Giacomo Leopardi is not a cantata, but a downright symphonic poem where a few singable episodes occasionally emerge. Zanetto can be considered as a “little” opera not because of its short duration, of the orchestra ensemble including no brass or its only two characters (soprano and mezzosoprano en travesti), but because of its decidedly lyrical style and basic lack of action: the act is just a long encounter-conversation in a Renaissance Florence between a young minstrel and Silvia, a rich, bored lady who reciprocates his love but, being a courtesan, cannot allow herself such a feeling and must reject the young boy.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=8007068219223&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Italy,2019 Bongiovanni,1996 Bongiovanni,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This statement by George Mathias is in itself enough to gauge the importance of Johann Baptist Cramer in the history of piano teaching. Cramer's approach to composition retained the strong baroque influence of Bach, Händel and Scarlatti combined with the Viennese classicism of Mozart and Haydn – Cramer's lasting friendship with the latter began when he played for Haydn in 1791. Cramer was also open to the new music of the time and his tours enabled him to hear it first hand in Paris, Berlin, the Low Countries, Munich and Vienna. From 1817 he lived for a period in Germany – indeed in the second decade of the 19th century Cramer was considered among the greatest pianist-composers together with Clementi and Dussek. The 60 Etudes contained in this publication are those which have become classics as selected and revised by Hans von Bülow with comments and fingering. Cramer published the original complete 84 Etudes in two books: the first in 1804 for Breitkopf & Härtel of Leipzig and the second some time between 1807 and 1808.

A recent album dedicated to Johann Kaspar Mertz shone the spotlight on an early-Romantic figure writing tone-poems for the guitar just as Schumann was doing the same for the piano. His models and forbears had included Mauro Giuliani and the indefatigable Anton Diabelli. Their lesser-known contemporaries included Simon Molitor and the subject of this newly recorded compendium, Wenzeslaus Thomas Matiegka (1773-1830). Bohemian in origin, and born into a musical family, he studied music within the family before moving to Prague in the year of Mozart’s death, 1791. Having graduated with a law degree, however, he moved to Vienna, studied composition more assiduously and encountered the fashionable guitar, which soon became his favorite instrument. By 1806 he was described as among the main exponents of ‘the new Viennese guitar school’. In that capacity Matiegka established for himself a successful career as a teacher, performer and composer, until his death from consumption at the age of 57. The works presented here illustrate his all-round gifts, satisfying as they do the varied purposes of teaching, entertainment, display and serious contemplation. The pair of ‘grandes sonates’ on set certainly fulfill the requirements of the last aim, with a Schubertian breadth of phrase and contentment. The second album in this release is occupied by a set of Six Sonatas Op.31 which are cast in a lighter vein but still within the Classical structures formed and perfected by Haydn. Virtuoso brilliance is the order of the day on the third album, with its 12 Menuets Brillants, and a fantasia and variation set based on popular melodies. Album 4 includes both a Sonata facile and Sonate progressive aimed at students, as well as several more variation sets. Matiegka’s work as a pedagogue also dominates albums 5 and 6 in the form of a progressive guitar method Op.24, and the collection comes to a delightful close with the composer’s Opus 1 – a set of 12 Leichte Ländler – and more variations, including an Op.12 set based on Mozart’s Don Giovanni.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=5028421950846&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Germany,2019 Brilliant Classics,2019 Brilliant Classics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Born the year before Mozart in 1755, Giovanni Battista Viotti has been eclipsed by his Salzburg contemporary – for who would not be? Yet Viotti wrote so much more than display vehicles for the instrument of which he was the pre-eminent Italian virtuoso of his generation. He composed quartets throughout his eventful career, which included a brief period as a wine merchant. The agreeable, undemanding idiom of his quartet-writing reveals not only his own fondness for music that he and his friends and pupils could play together privately, but also the growing tendency to make the concert repertoire available to amateur musicians in their own homes. The set of six quartets Op.1 was published in Paris around 1783. The general mood is serene and enjoyable but never banal, thanks to Viotti’s skill at surprising listeners with unusual combinations of timbre and register across the four instruments. The incisive start of the first quartet, for example, is reminiscent of a concerto, whereas in the fourth, and even more so in the fifth quartets of the set, the individual timbres of the viola and cello are interwoven to great effect, here and there evoking a sense of mystery, or indeed drama. Op.1 met with considerable acclaim, and was followed soon after (1787) by the six quartets of Op.3, that are clearly a development and completion of the first collection. Dedicated to his brother André, the following three quartets, which have no opus number, cross the threshold of the 19th century. Viotti himself took pleasure from them: ‘really fascinating and perhaps something more’. The set is completed by a standalone work in E minor, which is a free arrangement of the Violin Concerto No.18, including the addition of a new second movement and a slow introduction. Mezzena’s playing of Viotti comes ‘highly recommended’ in a 2004 survey of French violin school recordings by the Music Library Association. The veteran violinist has founded the present ensemble specifically to play these works of unfailing charm.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=5028421952642&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Germany,2019 Brilliant Classics,2019 Brilliant Classics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Just five years later he was dead, having contracted typhoid from a contaminated sorbet. The Belgian Lekeu left behind him a small but individual output of mostly chamber music. He found his voice as a precocious teenager, and felt able to declare at the age of 17 that his music might be ‘weird, mad, horrible, anything you like, but at least it will be original!’ Following both Wagner and his principal model, César Franck, the predominant mood of his music is melancholy: ‘Joy is a thousand times harder to paint than suffering,’ he once declared. This album features his two best-known works. Dating from 1890, the Piano Trio is in fact one of his most restrained and least Wagnerian pieces. A complex first movement is full of fleeting expression, followed in more conventional form by a slow movement, scherzo and finale with slow introduction. Commissioned by his fellow Belgian, the violinist Eugène Ysaÿe, Lekeu’s Violin Sonata is his masterpiece. It attains a rare balance and purity of expression through a beautifully balanced relationship between the instruments and through the kind of cyclical unity of form and melody that Franck perfected. These performances are led by the Portuguese violinist Bruno Monteiro, whose discography on Brilliant Classics includes widely praised albums of Schulhoff and Szymanowski.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=5028421957395&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Germany,2019 Brilliant Classics,2019 Brilliant Classics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This set gathers up the surviving music by Johann Lorenz Bach (1695–1773), Johann Bernhard Bach (1676–1749), his son Johann Ernst Bach (1722–1777), Heinrich Bach (1615–1692) and his grandson Johann Friedrich Bach (1682–1730). These are no mere shavings from the Bachian workbench – chips off the old JS block – but beautifully crafted works by composers working in the central German-Baroque tradition, each with their own voice. Three versions of ‘Wir glauben all’ an einen Gott’ by Johann Bernard Bach treat the chorale melody to grand and elaborately woven counterpoint. A pair of multi-movement Partitas is attributed to the Bach family without firm evidence of authorship, but they both work through the verses of a chorale melody with the skill and elegance typical of the Bach family’s work as a whole. Stefano Molardi is a native of Cremona and a recognized organist, harpsichordist, conductor, and musicologist with a number of prestigious awards to his name and a career that has taken him from the Musikverein in Vienna, to Carnegie Hall in New York, and Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles. On this recording he plays the Dell’Orto e Lanzini organ (2003) in the Parish Church of St Thomas, Gesso di Zola Predosa. Reviewing Molardi’s album of the complete organ music by two more scions of the Bach family, Johann Christoph and Johann Michael, Fanfare praised ‘assured, stylish performances, warmly recommended.’ ‘Molardi’s ear for the organ’s almost infinite palette of colors and textural combinations is matched by his fleet fingers and feet on the pedals.

Showing equal energy and invention in both words and music, however, he soon pursued parallel activities as a composer and a critic. He was friends with both Rossini and Mercadante but held Verdi’s music in little esteem. His own music looks to the north of the Alps for its inspiration: to Chopin and Schumann, Thalberg and Liszt. Though he engaged in operatic composition – writing a Christopher Columbus drama, for example – Gambini focused his compositional energies on piano music and vocal chamber works such as the Romanzas recorded for the first time on this album. This genre enjoyed huge popularity at the time in Italy, though its format did not translate readily or survive well beyond the 19th century: the nearest equivalents would be English and German ballads, at least until Reinaldo Hahn cast a spell over the drawing rooms of fin-de-siècle Paris. Cast between a song and an operatic scena, Gambini’s romanzas set texts by contemporary lyricists such as Felice Romani (librettist for Bellini’s Norma and much else besides) and the Genovese poet Giuseppe Torre. They talk of love and loneliness, the sea and the shore, and Gambini’s settings burn with declamatory fire and passionate confession. This is the second album of Gambini’s music on Brilliant Classics, following an absorbing survey of his organ music, played by Marco Ruggeri.

The French piano concerto was a late arrival on the European stage, and even then many French composers would opt to combine piano and orchestra outside the confines of strict concerto form. This set hones in on the genre’s heyday along with two precursors: a two-movement Concerto in F (1792) by the ‘French Mozart’ Boieldieu and the early Concerti da camera Op.10 (1832–38) by the maverick genius Alkan. The set begins with the five piano concertos that traverse Saint-Saëns’s career, along with concertante pieces he composed in the 1880s during a 20-year hiatus between his Fourth (1875) and Fifth (1896). The ’80s were fertile for Saint-Saëns’s contemporary Franck, as well, who returned to the piano after decades focusing on the organ and on choral music to create such piano concertante masterworks as Les Djinns and the Variations symphoniques. The latter work was an influence on Claude Debussy’s Fantaisie, in terms of the roles assigned to the orchestra and solo piano and the work’s structure, and like Franck before him, Debussy would disown this youthful work to move in a new direction – surprising given the warm reception enjoyed today by the early works of both composers. The influence of Saint-Saëns and Franck would extend to several of Debussy’s contemporaries, as well. Jules Massenet’s Concerto in E flat, begun in his early twenties, but only finished at the turn of the century after his many successful operas, arrived too late for the shifting tastes of the time, which had turned their backs on romantic virtuosity in favor of the impressionistic and neo-classical. Three of the group ‘Les Six’ figure on this set: Francis Poulenc and the charm and wit of his Concertos for one and for two Pianos, Germaine Tailleferre and the impressionistic orientalism of her Ballade, and the prolific Darius Milhaud who contributes no less than five piano concertos and four other concertante pieces. Albert Roussel and Reynaldo Hahn, though older than the members of ‘Les Six’, would only come to write piano concertos in their 50s, well into the inter-war period. Hahn’s concerto is featured here in a very special remastered historic recording from 1937, with the composer at the podium and the renowned Brazilian pianist Magda Tagliaferro as soloist.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=5028421958996&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Germany,2019 Brilliant Classics,2019 Brilliant Classics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both sacred and secular vocal works survive but have been very little known beyond libraries. This album affords a rare opportunity to get to know a lively 17th-century musical voice, interpreted by a young early-music group. Ensemble Démesure present eight cantatas, all based on time-honoured Classical themes. Scored for solo voice and continuo, they alternate recitative and aria, though the distinction between the two genres is often blurred. On occasions the recitatives tend in the direction of arias, whereas the arias themselves are more structured in form. In this they represent a perfect synthesis of Venetian and Monteverdi-style musical narrative, in an idiom typical of the style that made Naples the musical capital of Italy at the time of Caresana’s maturity. La Rosa is dedicated to the flower symbolic of passion, in which thorns and petals are associated with lovelorn grief and intensity of feeling. Il Narciso tells the story of the young man who drowns having fallen in love with his own reflection in the water. Folk melodies and artful technique also combine to produce an affecting lament in the cantata Viver senza speranza (To live without hope). The closing item on the album is Tancredi sulla morte di Clorinda, setting a text famously treated by Monteverdi, to whom Caresana pays humble tribute. Founded in 2006, Ensemble Démesure has made the Cantata – the emblematic genre of the 17th and 18th centuries – its core repertoire. The members of the ensemble hail from different countries, but share a particular interest in the Neapolitan Baroque School. They largely focus on unpublished works, delving deep into the extravagance of baroque expression and its intrinsic contrast with scholarly passion. In this sense they are Démesure: in other words, unconstrained, measureless, in their pursuit of musical chiaroscuro.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=5028421959238&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Germany,2019 Brilliant Classics,2019 Brilliant Classics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sound training and determination took him to Helsinki as violist and part-time conductor for the Finnish Opera, thence to Brisbane for his first musical directorship in charge of the Queensland Philharmonic. But it was in 1992 that Kuchar discovered his roots and began to establish an international reputation when he took over the National Symphony Orchestra of the Ukraine. Together they have given lengthy tours worldwide, hundreds of concerts and made many recordings for several labels. The theatre music by Shostakovich was particularly successful and holds a treasured place in Kuchar’s heart: ‘The Bolt is absolute genius. I’ve done it with every orchestra I’ve had a long relationship with, and every time it knocks an audience sideways.’ In the early 2000s Kuchar also worked regularly with the Janácek Philharmonic Orchestra based in Ostrava, formerly known as the Czech Radio Orchestra. Together they recorded the major – and most of the minor – orchestral works by Smetana, the best-known tone-poems of Dvorák and even the complete symphonies of Carl Nielsen, which became a critical hit. Since then Kuchar has conducted orchestras throughout Europe, Asia and the Americas. As music director of the Orquesta Sinfónica Venezuela he led a vibrantly colorful collection of Latin-American orchestral classics (by Ginastera, Moncayo and Revueltas among others) for the last album on this retrospective, recorded in 2011. ‘Theodore Kuchar is one of today's most dynamic, most successful young conductors… every instrumental effect comes through beautifully… Tempos are generally rapid and spirits high… this is a lot of fine Dvorák for a very low price.’ (Fanfare)",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=5028421959320&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Germany,2019 Brilliant Classics,2019 Brilliant Classics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These covered Bach, Barrios, Tárrega, as well as popular Brazilian composers – foremost among whom was Reis himself, who had learnt the instrument from his father, Fernando. Songs such as Dois Destinos and Se Ela Perguntar have become standards of the Brazilian guitar tradition. Sentimental, memorable, nostalgic, Reis’s music conjures memories of bygone eras for many Brazilians. His skill as an artist lay in not only crafting the kind of melody that’s new but instantly recognizable, but also adapting time-honored native forms such as the chorus to fit those melodies. No less ‘Brazilian’ in character than the work of Heitor Villa-Lobos, Reis’s music speaks to a worldwide audience. For some time, the songs of Dilermando Reis were inimitably associated with his own performances preserved on record. Now, however, a new generation of guitarists outside Brazil is taking an interest in his music and making it their own. Among the most distinguished of them is Salvatore Fortunato, born in Genoa in 1990 and now a professor at the prestigious Accademia Chitarristica Castelli Romani. International recognition has included many competition successes and the 2014 Young Artist Award made by the Cattedrali Letterarie Europee in Rome.

Thus he presents here the First Book of pieces – a second does not survive – by Jacques Morel. The volume itself was published in 1709, two years before Marin Marais’s Third Book of pieces. Morel’s date of birth is now obscured by time, but we know that he was this book. And indeed Morel makes no a pupil of Marais, to whom he dedicated attempt to disguise the debt he felt to his master within his music. The book contains four Suites for viola da gamba and continuo – in A minor, D minor, D major and G major, respectively – and a Chaconne en trio for a traverso flute, viol and basso continuo. This gentle and courtly six-minute Chaconne is the only piece of Morel’s that is regularly performed, but the four Suites are full of delightful discoveries. The second of them begins with a Prelude of bold and grave gestures which introduce a colorful suite of character pieces: the Allemande la Jolie (‘The pretty one’), the Courante la Dacier, a gentle, dream-like Sarabande and the Gigue l’Inconstante (‘The faithless one’). To end, there is an enjoyable rondeau, Le Folet (‘The imp’), and La Fanchonnette, reminiscent of a gavotte in feel and structure. The other three suites are no less picturesque, and they are brought to life once more on this album by an early-music group founded in 2009 and named after a popular Renaissance dance.

Kurt Atterberg began studying music in 1902 after having been inspired by a concert by the Brussels String Quartet. Six years later he became a performer in the Stockholm Concert Society, now known as the Royal Stockholm Philharmonic Orchestra. That same year he published his first work- Rhapsody for Piano and Orchestra, Op. 1. His String Quartet No. 1 in D major, Op. 2, soon followed. He studied both electrical engineering at the Royal Institute of Technology and music at the Royal College of Music, Stockholm. Lars-Erik Vilner Larsson was born in Åkarp in 1908, the son of a factory worker and a nurse. He studied with Ellberg at the Stockholm Conservatory (1925–1929) and with Alban Berg and Fritz Reuter in Vienna and Leipzig (1929–1930), then worked for Swedish radio and taught at the Stockholm Conservatory (1947–1959) and Uppsala University where he held the position as Director musices (1961–1966). His style as a composer is eclectic, ranging from the late Romantic to techniques derived from Arnold Schoenberg's twelve-note system, but original in method. He was the first Swede to write serial music. Ingvar Lidholm was born in Jönköping. By age twelve, he was writing songs in a tonal and romantic idiom, which led gradually to exercises of larger proportions, including music for full orchestra. This early period also included orchestration studies with Natanael Berg in Stockholm. Lidholm’s primary performance area was stringed instruments; he eventually studied and mastered all four instruments of the string family.

All three composers on this album are descendants of this Nordic Romanticism. Although they did not all have the same nationality, their lives are intertwined. In their compositions, Svendsen and Halvorsen remain in form and harmony close to the music of their good friend Edvard Grieg and the distinctive Nordic use of melody; Carl Nielsen, however, goes on a voyage of discovery towards a new idiom with a strong desire for renewal on the one hand and a great need for the revival of the pure archaic on the other. His violin concerto clearly shows this conflict. In a neo-classical 4-part form, reminiscent of the setup of the Baroque concerto grosso, with seemingly simple classical-like themes and references to both Bach and Mozart, he takes the listeners on an incredible adventure throughout Nordic landscapes of pure wilderness and takes all sorts of harmonic and rhythmic twists and turns. Lisa Jacobs writes: “Since the first time I performed the Nielsen violin concerto in 2007, I have been overwhelmed from the very first note. Such an incredible connection with the whimsical Nordic nature that is displayed in this music, such as a natural use of the violin as both a lyrical and virtuoso instrument and such an originality.”",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=608917279924&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Austria,2019 Challenge Classics,2019 Challenge Classics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The influence of Mozart’s piano concertos, which Strauss was studying at the time, is apparent, not least in the writing for solo clarinet and the orchestral bassoon – a scoring favoured by Mozart, and re-visited by Strauss in his final instrumental work the Duett-Concertino from 1947. Like other of his late compositions, this work seems to reject the full-blown expressionism for which we know Strauss best, and reflects a more neo-classical sound. Another early work, the Violin Concerto was first performed in 1882, and demonstrates Strauss’ growing technical skill and developing compositional voice. Despite continued performances in both Germany and England, Strauss ultimately came to distance himself from a piece which he presumably regarded as unrepresentative of his mature style. Many commentators on the works of Strauss have felt that the Burleske was a significant turning point in his development, seemingly pointing the way ahead to the technical dexterity and emotional palette of his later tone poems.

The latter, in particular, highlights one of the main characteristics of the aesthetic/musical vision of the Ukrainian composer, a disarming exterior-paralysis/interior-vitality (expanded here by the indication of the author who warns that the piece must be performed with a closed sound box) in which every note, every chord, although ideally and necessarily connected with each other, takes on its own precious and irreducible timbre and physical autonomy, in which the silence that surrounds them makes their inner effects reflect and intensify.”",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=3615935850186&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Piano,Italy,Continuo Records,Continuo Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Gregor Meyer conducts the Gewandhaus Chorus and the camerata lipsiensis in Friedrich Schneider’s Das Weltgericht. The composer, pianist, organist, and Anhalt-Dessau court music director Friedrich Schneider was one of the most creative and productive minds in the Central German music world during the first half of the nineteenth century but today is unfortunately a forgotten man. Das Weltgericht was once one of the most famous German oratorios, inspired euphoric headlines everywhere when it was first composed, and occasioned genuine storms of enthusiasm among concertgoers. The libretto is by August Apel, who based his text on the biblical accounts of the Last Judgment in Matthew 24-25 and the Revelation of John. A plot in the strict sense is not narrated; rather, the persons are biblical messengers who tell us of heaven, hell, and earth. This oratorio situated between classicism and romanticism was often performed but then was forgotten for many decades. The conductor Gregor Meyer wants to stimulate a new discussion about the oeuvre of Friedrich Schneider, who once lived and worked in Leipzig. A critical edition of the source materials will assist him in this project.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=761203511921&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Chant,Germany,2019 cpo,2019 cpo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this work Alfvén, like many other Scandinavian composers, found the typical Nordic tone of his music in the sunny south. Like Sibelius’ second symphony and Stenhammar’s Serenade for Orchestra, this symphony is Swedish through and through. In addition, it is pervaded by the longing for home repeatedly felt by Alfvén during his years of wandering. He composed his Uppsala Rhapsody in 1907 for the commemoration of the two hundredth anniversary of the birth of the great botanist Carl von Linné (Linnaeus) held at the University of Uppsala in May 1907. Like its counterpart by Johannes Brahms, this work turned out to be an »Academic Festival Overture« including some student songs. The Concert Suite from Alfvén’s ballet The Mountain King offers a masterful wealth of color. His excellent knowledge of the art of instrumentation was the product of his earlier activity as a violinist in the Royal Court Orchestra, which also served as the Opera Orchestra.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=761203523726&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Orchestral,Germany,2019 cpo,2019 cpo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, it is known only to a few that Loewe not only composed some six hundred songs and ballads but also produced chamber music. In 1831 the Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung described his Piano Trio or Grand Trio op. 12 as “magnificent, finely invented, sustained, and intelligently developed.” Robert Schumann expressed himself in a similar vein: “It is perhaps one of the most fundamentally genuine and most imaginative works by Loewe, one of those worthiest of the best master. Every trio circle must have it.” In his last instrumental work, the Duo Espagnôla for viola and piano, the composer once again ventured onto national terrain and took with him the viola as a special expressive means conveying the Spanish character. The work is melodious throughout and shows both instruments in their best light. The Scottish Pictures for clarinet and piano from Loewe’s late period are demanding genre scenes inspired by the composer’s interest in the Scottish landscape and the country’s vicissitudinous history.

And of course it’s important … so that later on you don’t get such a big shock.” The orchestral overtures brought together on the present recording make the listener eager to hear each of the particular works following them. Even those who do not recognize the fine details of their design will enjoy the inexhaustible wealth of their melodies, the irresistible rhythms and lyricisms, and the skilled details of their instrumentation.

The original Straussian version initially rapidly made its way around the world, with performances in the lands of the Danube monarchy as well as in Hamburg, Munich, and London and even in New York. Nevertheless, until the end of World War I it experienced only about five hundred performances, which means that it was clearly overshadowed by Die Fledermaus. Again and again the attempt was made to reinterpret the text with interventions revising its content. Erich Wolfgang Korngold took an additional step in 1923, when he not only adapted the text but also changed the original instrumentation and integrated inserts into the work from other operettas by Strauss, for example, from Simplicius (1880). For several reasons Korngold’s revised version was a success when it was performed at the Theater an der Wien on 25 October 1923: the stage set was lavish and magnificent, the new orchestration displayed tonal sophistication, and the great Richard Tauber was heard in the role of the Duke in quest of erotic adventures.

Lost for many years, it is now available for listening here in the revised version of 1729. The dramatic and musical design of Keiser’s work is astonishing. As in the Italian oratorio type that gained currency after 1700, there is no Evangelist or other narrator, which means that the work has a purely dramatic structure. Even though Keiser’s librettist Christian Friedrich Hunold, whose pseudonym was “Menantes,” did not cite any one of the four Evangelists word for word in his adaptation of the Passion narrative, it is quite evident that the poetic elaboration is (primarily) modeled on Luther’s translation of the Gospel of Matthew. As might be expected, Hunold and Keiser based their work on the dramatic means of the opera typical of their times while working on the one hand with contrasts between short, often homophonic five-part choirs of the two different groups of participants and on the other hand with multipart, interior monologues by the main characters. The great number of very highly expressive arias and ariosi, each of which has its own very special character, produced a tightly woven fabric that, far from the traditional Kantorei tradition, forms a link to the modern music of its times. Keiser’s oft-praised instrumentation artistry is shown here in his innovative, effectively and enthrallingly varied tone-color combinations in the orchestra. His talent for the clear delineation of a musical scenario with only a single accompaniment voice is legendary.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=761203525928&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Chant,Germany,2019 cpo,2019 cpo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Alessandro Rolla composed this music around 1795, while he was at the Court of Parma, where he was in charge of the music programming for Ferdinand I Bourbon’ s public events as well as private entertainments. For this reason Rolla conforms to the duet form of his day but infuses it with a gracefulness that makes his music, composed for pure and simple entertainment, very attractive. These works possess a pleasant, joyful yet delicate and entertaining mood. Flutist Mario Carbotta ranks among Dynamic’s “historical” artists. A solo performer who collaborated with over 70 symphony and chamber orchestras worldwide, a conductor, a musicologist and a teacher, his repertoire ranges from the 1700s to contemporary works. Violinist Mario Hossen was an enfant-prodige. Today, he is internationally hailed for his incredible virtuosity and charismatic stage presence.

Those who mourn in isolation find not one, not two, but a community of others with whom they can identify.

It is kindled by the Oakland-based Friction Quartet, that spent many months breathing their own unique fire into these works.

Kohashi from Japan, Overwater and Verploegen from the Netherlands, beyond ethnicity and nationality, they seek and discover their own sound sharing the passion for music. Japanese pianist Atzko Kohashi had something special in mind when she invited Dutch bass player Tony Overwater to join her for a musical encounter. She longed to create a unique unit of bass harmony and melody with each voice being equal and contributing selflessly to the music. Her vision is connected to Japanese Zen aesthetics that generate simplicity and spontaneity. With trumpet player Angelo Verploegen they found their match- a soloist who can blend in, shine and support the music all at the same time. On a cold winter day, they met in an empty church in Amsterdam and started playing. For hours. Instantly the delicate sound of these three instruments blended into gentle and generous music that warmed their hearts. A few months later, they recorded the debut album Virgo in the only way possible for such a collaboration: in a beautiful radio studio from the 1930s, with a great sounding Steinway, only a few microphones but of the utmost quality and recorded directly to a two-track analogue tape recorder before a live audience.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=0608917471427&medium=phy,02 Jazz,Jazz,,Austria,2019 Challenge Records,2019 Challenge Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, Márton Borsányi had to consider carefully whether he should play these pieces on the harpsichord or the organ. For those pieces where the virtuoso chose the harpsichord, he is playing on a reproduction of the Mayer harpsichord from 1619 – one of the only 13 instruments preserved from the time of Pachelbel. Where the organ is his choice of instrument, he is playing on the euphonious Deutschmann organ in the Kálvin Square Reformed Church in Budapest. By exploring the full potential of each instrument, Borsányi presents not only a historically accurate interpretation but also one of exceptional musicality and sensitivity. The composer’s ingenuity, which was even praised by Johann Mattheson, an important publicist at the time, is wonderfully expressed here.

That he has played several instruments, clarinet included, has provided a good basis for Sloughs (2013). Ness has attracted attention since the mid-1990s with the originality of his compositions. It is not his ingenuity, but rather a cheerful vitality that distinguishes his music. It captivates, and the musical expression and titles of his works are unconventional. He has an abundance of ideas, all elegantly developed, and his experience with pop music has given him an awareness of rhythm that permeates the rest of his contemporary works. “Sloughs” has a three-part structure. A more tranquil middle section is encompassed by virtuosic and power-driven passages, insistent and serpent-like. The work was commissioned by the artists. Carl Fruhling composed for all genres, including church music, orchestral works and chamber music. The English cellist Steven Isserlis has done a lot to bring Fruhling’s pleasing music to light again after many years of obscurity. The Trio opus 40 was published in 1925 and is in classical four-movement form. Ludwig van Beethoven published Trio opus 38 in 1805, but already then it had something of a varied existence. The work began as “Septet opus 20” for three wind and four string players. The transcription retains the clarinet part from the septet, while the cello part is imbued with an unusually independent quality, and the piano takes over for the missing instruments. The Trio was dedicated to Johann Adam Schmidt, the composer’s physician, who tried in vain to inhibit the progress of his deafness.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=7090020181387&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,,2019 Lawo Classics,2019 Lawo Classics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The collection comprises forty Latin motets for four voices, plus a figured bass for continuo accompaniment (realized on this recording by lute, violone and organ), which was added later by the composer. The perfectly crafted works are composed in a learned, contrapuntal style rich in dissonance and range of expression. Schütz cleverly mirrors the intensely intimate nature of the texts using a musical language that looks to inward expression rather than to external effect. Schütz takes every opportunity to exploit vocal timbre and technique in the service of word-painting, with the virtuosic vocal lines ranging from a conservative imitative style to the most avant-garde, chromatic style of the Italian madrigal.

The Concerto for Piano and Orchestra (2013) was commissioned by the Boston Symphony Orchestra in celebration of Rands’s eightieth birthday year and as implied by its title, the piece is for piano and orchestra rather than a piano concerto. Hence, the solo part is primus inter pares and is not required to play the conventional role of a protagonist striving heroically for supremacy over the masses. Canti del Sole, for tenor and orchestra (1983) describes a day’s progression from dawn to dusk through a continuous setting of fourteen poems about the sun. The poems are arranged into two groups of seven. Music for Shoko: Aubade is an atmospheric mini-tone poem for English horn and string quartet (2017).

In terms of his music connected with the war, the Mass ‘Via Victrix 1914-1918’ Op. 173 would be his greatest and most substantial effort, and it would prove to be a canvas to equal similar large-scale choral tours de force such as his Requiem Op. 63 (1897), Te Deum Op. 66 (1898) and Stabat Mater Op. 96 (1907), all ambitiously conceived for chorus, four soloists, orchestra and organ. Bearing the adapted Latin dedication ( ‘Transiverunt per ignem et aqua et eduxisti in refrigerium’ [“(They) went through fire and water and thou has brought (them) into a wealthy place”?] taken from Psalm 66 verse 12 (from Tyndale’s translation), the work was dedicated to those who made the greatest sacrifice in defence of their country. The mass was therefore intended as a work of thanksgiving, of celebration for the final victory, but equally one which looked into the heart of the nation, to commiserate with those who grieved, to pray for those whose sense of loss was unconsolable, and to urge for a spirit of renewal in the face of the hardships and sorrows the nation had had to endure. In this sense Stanford’s work stood at the vanguard of other cathartic expressions of war grief such as John Foulds’ A World Requiem (1921), Delius’s Requiem (1914, but not performed until 1922) and Arthur Bliss’s Morning Heroes (1930). When news was made known of the unveiling of the Cenotaph and the interment of the Unknown Warrior at Westminster Abbey in October 1920, the Right Hon. Mr Justice Charles John Darling (1st Baron Darling) published a poem ‘At the Abbey Gate’ in The Times on 26 October (under the initials C.J.D.) as part of a larger article ‘To the Unknown Dead’ announcing the special nature of the ceremony on 11 November. Through a desire to commemorate this major national occasion, Stanford decided to set Darling’s poem as a march for chorus, solo baritone and orchestra.

""A romantic hero"", ""a pianist of all-absorbing sensitivity""... This is how the audience normally perceives Lugansky, an inspired interpreter of the works by Rachmaninoff, Tchaikovsky, Chopin, Schumann and Liszt. Although the pianist was awarded the Silver Medal of the 1988 Bach International Competition in Leipzig, Bach was not a frequent name in his concert repertoire. The pianist finished the Moscow Conservatory’s Central Music School where he studied the piano with Professor Tatiana Nikolayeva who won a convincing victory at the first Bach Competition held in 1950. She was recognized to be one of the best interpreters of the Leipzig cantor’s music of the second half of the twentieth century. The Teacher’s outstanding mastery that carries the light of the great tradition of ""Russian Bachiana"" could not pass without a trace for the emerging pianist. The 18-year-old Nikolai Lugansky interprets Bach as a successor of the traditions of the Russian performing school. The recital program reflects the wide stylistic and genre spectrum of Bach’s clavier legacy. The Chromatic Fantasia and Fugue conceived by the composer in the early 1720’s in Köthen for a “big” harpsichord with two manuals (keyboards) and a pedal; Partita No. 6, along with five other pieces published by Bach in the first edition of the Keyboard Exercises in Leipzig (1731); the Italian Concerto for solo clavier that was completed in 1735 and became a peculiar outcome of Bach’s music in the concerto genre. Exploration of the Bach repertoire became an important milestone on Lugansky’s path to the highest achievements of piano art. This ""early"" recital of the pianist is still perceived as a convincing creative victory, a vivid contribution to the performing arts of the late twentieth century.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=4600317125708&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Russia,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

None has that rare combination in higher degree than Vladimir Ashkenazy”, wrote a Gramophone reviewer. Fifty-five years ago, the young pianist went to the West and decided not to return to the USSR. Already in the 1970s, he had a reputation of one of the world’s best pianists with an uncommonly extensive repertoire. However, the studio and live recordings made by the pianist during the Soviet period are indicative of his pronounced, individual style he showcased from the first steps of his career. By the early 1960s, he had become a genuine mature master, who did not sound pale against the background of the greatest piano performers of the time. The programme of Vladimir Ashkenazy’s one of the last recitals in Moscow (he already owned the second prize of the Chopin International Competition, the Grand Prix of the prestigious Queen Elisabeth Competition in Brussels and the 2nd International Tchaikovsky Competition in Moscow) included Beethoven’s Sonatas Nos 17 and 18, Chopin’s four ballades and Debussy’s pieces.

Some of the works were written for or dedicated to him. Further definitive recordings are guaranteed by performances from cellist Catherine Marie Tunnell, Radulescu’s widow and the director of Lucero Press. The organ and its interaction with its acoustic environment compliments Radulescu’s “spectral music” palette and what he referred to as “sound plasma”— a special state of sound beyond equal temperament. ""Intimate Rituals III"" is presented in its version for cello and “sound icons.” During 1965-69, Radulescu had transformed his Bösendorfer grand piano into a kind of harp, putting it vertically on its side and without cover, naming it sound icon. The strings are tuned spectrally, played with a V-form bow of horse hair or with other objects like coins, spheres etc. (The keyboard is not used at all). Due to the special tuning and the bowing technique, if one just touches a string all other strings begin to resonate, creating a rich harmonic halo around each sound. In 1985 Radulescu, together with Petra Junken, recorded two improvisations, each of them on two sound icons.

The three sonatas in this recording date from the spring of 1816. Their modest dimensions, “for pianoforte with accompaniment of violin” - an old-fashioned formulation evoking the eighteenth century - led to their being published as ‘sonatinas’, even though their facility is only apparent and in no way reflects their nature, nor Schubert’s intentions. They correspond to a fertile period for the composer and are contemporary with his Fourth Symphony, his Stabat Mater, the composition of his opera Die Bürgschaft, much chamber music and, of course, lieder – the final draft of Marguerite at the Spinning Wheel and the Erlkönig date from March 1816. Schubert also experienced great personal changes, and with the support of a circle of acquaintances that expanded in the direction of an artistic, intellectual and liberal elite that was betting on his talent, he took it upon himself fully to become a composer. These sonatas are the work of a composer aged 19 who, in admiration of Mozart, drew close to the worlds of Weber and Beethoven. Indeed, the spirit of Mozart runs right through these three sonatas, he who represents the crucial reference at this time, and certainly was such for Schubert. Yet without imitating the master, Schubert rewrites the ‘Mozartian’ sonata, romanticises it, opens it out to the new century. Two muso artistes, both with long experience as chamber musicians, have got together to play these magnificent pieces: the excellent violinist Stéphanie Paulet and the pianist Daniel Isoir, who for the occasion plays an outstandingly beautiful Schott piano of 1835.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=5425019973292&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Austria,2019 Off The Records,2019 Off The Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PRISMA 2 opens with two debuts: James Lentini’s stunning first release with PARMA Recordings, and the Zagreb Festival Orchestra’s first project on the Navona label. Lentini’s Concerto for Guitar and Strings, performed with the string orchestra by virtuoso guitar soloist Iliana Matos, begins with a fresh and buoyant motive that serves as a foundation for the entire movement. Orchestra and guitar converse back and forth as the piece moves through a melancholic, reflective second movement, and then rises back to full energy with the brisk final movement. This is followed by Rain Worthington’s Full Circle, a somewhat dissonant, striking piece with the Moravian Philharmonic Orchestra that follows the emergence and recession of emotions through a lifetime, as soloists emerge and recede from the orchestra. Jan Järvlepp’s Camerata Music, is a bright, tonal piece in a style that the composer calls “post-academic.” Inspired by the vallenato styles of folk music that Järvlepp heard while visiting Colombia, Camerata Music uses percussion to capture the joyous, rhythmic energy of that musical tradition. Peter Castine’s Aperture takes the album in a more somber direction with unsettled dissonance and fragmented feeling, filled with the horror following the 2001 World Trade Center attacks. The composer sets the solo flute and concertino string quartet at odds with one another, clashing even as the orchestra sometimes intervenes to help. PRISMA 2 is brought to a close with composer Beth Mehocic’s Left of Winter, written as a prelude to Stravinsky’s Rite of Spring.

Perhaps it is not surprising, then, that there should be something timeless in the manner in which duo526 interpret their chosen works – and be they from the 20th century, like the compositions on DUO FANTASY. The selection itself is already superb, exploring the fantasia aspects of each piece through improvisatory style and free form. Villa-Lobos, Bax, and Bolcom each have a unique compositional voice, but heard together, they share the common thread of fantasy. Not only does this greatly contribute to the immense listenability of DUO FANTASY; more artistically, it also mirrors the relationship of the two musicians performing it. Violinist DuWors' audacious martelé, bold dynamics, and immense spectrum of tone are perfectly complemented by Niekawa's ever-sensitive musical command and uncompromising precision on the piano. Together, they achieve what most duos strive for in vain: a perfect homogeneity in interpretation. There is a great joy in risk-taking to be found here, but most importantly, the two musicians are impeccably in agreement at all times. DUO FANTASY is a wonderful example of how the sum of music is greater than its individual parts. No doubt that DuWors and Niekawa are formidable virtuoso musicians in their own right. But together, they are simply stunning.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7Q_H0kmB3g&feature=youtu.be,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=896931005319&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Violin,,,2019 Navona Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2019,Navona,NV6230,896931005302,Leonard Bernstein; George Gershwin ,Eliane Rodrigues: The Gershwin & Bernstein Connection,Eliane Rodrigues; Nina Smeets; Carlo Willems; Koen Wilmaers ,1,CD,11.69,11.69,"Piano virtuoso Eliane Rodrigues returns with her latest Navona Records release — THE GERSHWIN & BERNSTEIN COLLECTION, a new look at timeless pieces by legendary American composers. Together with talented artists including her daughter, pianist Nina Smeets, Rodrigues thrills audiences once again with her moving and truly spellbinding performances. First is Gershwin’s Rhapsody in Blue and this is a truly marvelous performance of the work. Gershwin’s intended improvisational, rubato style reigns, allowing the performers generous liberty to express a new interpretation. The employment of percussion blesses the timeless work with a fresh coat of paint. Gershwin’s masterpiece offers the perfect segue into an arrangement of symphonic dances from Bernstein’s West Side Story. Many audiences know the longing ballad “Somewhere” quite well and likely never thought it could get any sweeter, but Rodrigues’ ensemble adds a new layer. The recording is unexpectedly subtle — the polyrhythms are intact, but not overstated. The execution is balanced and exceptional in every single way. Finally, Rodrigues and her colleagues offer Gershwin’s Concerto in F in a seemingly effortless journey. One highlight is the meditative beginning of the second movement which captures the essence of George Gershwin and what listeners love so much about him, but with an arrangement that transpires into an all-out collection of keyboards, all performing with equal importance. The execution of these arrangements serves as an example of how an ensemble can tastefully bring new perspectives to a recording, rather than simply reiterate a well-known composition. The inclusion of the percussion helps to set this album apart. Similarly, this album is equal parts Gershwin, Bernstein, and Rodrigues. This step away from the strictly classical concerto displays Rodrigues’ innate versatility and strength as an artist. It cannot be emphasized enough how the creative use of percussion transforms these classics — an effort not easily achieved, yet Rodrigues and her ensemble gracefully pull it off.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBUpcdEcI_4,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=896931005302&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Piano,,,2019 Navona Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2019,Navona,NV6228,896931005289,Petr Eben ,Jitro Czech Girls Choir: In Heaven,Jitro Czech Girls Choir,1,CD,11.69,11.69,"The Jitro Czech Girls Choir, under the leadership of conductor and music director Jirí Skopal, presents yet another vivid exploration of the depths of traditional Czechoslovakian music on their fourth release with Navona, JITRO IN HEAVEN. The tone for the album is set by Liturgical Chants, five pieces which express the spiritual and musical code of European culture. These pieces are composed by Petr Eben, an icon of 20th-century Czech music. The emotional depth of the chants is also expressed in three parts of the cycle Four Choruses on Latin Texts. Written in 1973 for children’s or girls’ voices, the work is based on anonymous medieval texts. Catonis Moralia is also derived from Latin texts, this time from the 3rd Century; their translation by Czech philosopher, pedagogue, and theologian Johann Amos Comenius is used as the basis for combining the style of Baroque dance suites with instrumentally conceived choral polyphony. The poetry of Vítezslav Nezval, hovering at the boundary of the worlds of childhood and maturity, is mirrored in the imitative cycle Ten Poetic Duets, one of which, “Scorrendo Tranquillamente,” highlights the pristine vocals of soloist Barbora Novotna. The album concludes with About Swallows and Girls, a miniature analogy of Bach’s Art of the Fugue. Here, Eben has offered a wealth of variations of vocal arrangements of Bohemian, Moravian, and Silesian folk songs while retaining their folkloristic flavor. Eben’s artistic vision never loses respect for his sources, or for their simplicity and humanism. The voices of the young girls in the Jitro Czech Girls Choir declaiming and proclaiming the ancient Latin words usually sung by adults or, when offered by young singers invariably by boys, lends JITRO IN HEAVEN an interestingly modern slant. That more contemporary take on these timeless texts serves to create a dynamic musical offering that fully captures the bright, gleaming performances of this remarkable group.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ws6bn6KF1Qo&feature=youtu.be,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=896931005289&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Choral,,,2019 Navona Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To mend a breach with the violinist, Brahms later composed a concerto with the unusual combination of violin and cello, the latter played at the premiere by Joachim’s colleague Robert Hausmann.

The record is available exclusively through New Amsterdam’s Bandcamp subscription as part of the Windmill Series, a new digitally-focused set of releases for subscribers in addition to our existing release schedule. The album will be released on all other platforms in February 2019. Formed in Brooklyn in 2016, Alula was born out of several duo performances between Caroline Davis and Gregory Saunier. Internal monologues resulted in the addition of pianist/keyboardist Matt Mitchell, who Davis has worked with in other contexts. Alula’s debut album features original pieces by Davis, whole-heartedly motivated by the study of an anterior digit on a bird’s wing. The alula wing functions as a locomotive during flight and landing, and has specific rhythmic functions, which is of central concern on this self-titled album.

Fascinated by the unique energy generated live where performer and audience are locked in a moment of unplanned creativity, a moment where anything and everything can happen, we vowed to delve into this pool of creativity and unleash its energy onto record. Our intention was to create an album of bodhran and fiddle music. As the recording session grew ever closer. It became clear that making an album of solely bodhran and fiddle music would somehow not tell the full story. Why impose those limitations anyway? Artistically we had more to offer and could enrich this music with diverse flavors. Inspired by the folk tale of the 'Stone Soup', we began to assemble raw ingredients. I scanned my rehearsal space for the appropriate additional sounds. Seeking to include instruments that I had yet to experiment with in recording. Each track, one by one, found its feet and fell into form. Often a track flowed from beginning to end in a single take. Other times we'd record a segment, listen back and feel where to go from there. The order in which the album appears is almost identical to that in which it was recorded. The result is strangely coherent: linked improvisations that appear almost as a pre-meditated. It forms an album in the traditional sense: a work that is intended to be listened to as a whole. We truly hope you enjoy this album as much as we enjoyed making it.”",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=0710357637322&medium=phy,14 Folk,Folk,Folk,United Kingdom,2018 Wyastone Estate Limited,2018 Wyastone Estate Limited,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One day in January I was playing it on the piano and, beginning to improvise, I thought “I can turn this into something bigger, and why not a symphony?” I felt a little uneasy about using such a simple tune for a symphony, particularly with this number, but I was reminded of Nielsen’s Sixth, whose almost naïve opening leads to much more serious events. So my tune, now in C major instead of its original G, began to explore more complex and darker regions as my sonata-form first movement progressed. The coda gently brings back the carol, which moves unexpectedly into A flat major and a solo violin melody at the end. I began the ‘Variations for Strings’ with two preliminary ideas. The first was that my chosen chorale theme should appear at the end rather than the beginning. Since the words of the chorale are a prayer for a peaceful night, it seemed appropriate that the chorale should be the culmination of the piece, while the variations might be seen as reflecting the activities of the day. The second idea was that the string writing should be as diverse as possible, and that all 24 players should on occasion be used as soloists. Mozart’s Sinfonia Concertante for violin and viola is one of my favorite works of his. I have always loved the special relationship between the two soloists: rather than rivalry, there is a sense of coming together in friendship. I have tried to express the same harmonious qualities in my own Double Concerto.”",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=0710357638220&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Orchestral,United Kingdom,2019 Wyastone Estate Limited,2019 Wyastone Estate Limited,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The poems echo the words in Stabat Mater reflecting the grief of a mother for her son Lev, a student at Leningrad University, who, in 1938, at the height of Stalin’s terror, was arrested in his dormitory room and shipped to an Arctic labor camp. For 17 months his mother waited in queues and wrote letters to police officials beseeching them to tell her the fate of her son. Her struggle is immortalized in “Requiem”, her most famous work. Alternating between elegy, lamentation and witness, it culminates in its most famous stanza: “For seventeen months I’ve been crying out, Calling you home. I flung myself at the hangman’s feet, For you my son, my horror.” The music embraces the passion of these words.

This new album by the Finnish Radio Symphony Orchestra conducted by Hannu Lintu includes world première recordings of three works by Saariaho featuring bass-baritone Gerald Finley and harpist Xavier de Maistre as soloists. True Fire is a six-movement song cycle that was written to a commission from the Los Angeles Philharmonic, the NDR Symphony Orchestra, the BBC Symphony Orchestra and the Orchestre National de France, for baritone Gerald Finley with an original idea to explore the scope of the baritone voice. The texts conclusively determined what the vocal expression would be like and how the details in the musical material would shape up. The disparate texts chosen by Saariaho in fact have a common underlying theme: the status of humankind surrounded by nature, our observations of it and our belonging to it. Saariaho’s orchestral triptych Orion (2002) is one of her most performed works. Orion as a celestial phenomenon is showcased in the middle movement, Winter Sky. In 2013, Saariaho rescored this movement for a smaller orchestra, and to distinguish it from the original she gave it a title in French with the same meaning, Ciel d’hiver. It joins the series of works by Saariaho that are in one way or another inspired by things in sky and space. Trans for harp and orchestra is the composer’s latest addition to a series of concertos. It was written to a joint commission from the Suntory Foundation for Arts, the Finnish Radio Symphony Orchestra, the Swedish Radio Symphony Orchestra, the Tonhalle Orchestra in Zurich, Radio France and the Hessen Radio Orchestra.

In this album, two baroque-influenced and virtuosic early sonatas are coupled together with a touching A minor Sonata K. 310 – written at the time of the composer’s mother’s death – and a delightful, Haydnesque Sonata K. 333. Mozart wrote Piano Sonatas K. 280 and K. 281 (Nos. 2 & 3) most likely in 1774, at the age of 18. The elements of Baroque influence are clearly evident in the K. 280 Sonata. A prominent feature in the K. 281 Sonata is, besides its virtuosity, the beautiful slow-movement, “Andante amoroso”. The K. 310 Sonata (No. 8) was written four years later, during the summer of 1778, and is written in a minor key: a rarity among Mozart’s Sonatas. The K. 333 was published in 1784, but the time of its composition might have been earlier. This joyful work with virtuosic passages can be described almost as a Piano Concerto for the solo piano. Lars Vogt was appointed the first ever “Pianist in Residence” by the Berlin Philharmonic in 2003/04 and enjoys a high profile as a soloist and chamber musician.

Utterly convinced by the richness of Wolf’s oeuvre, Fischer-Dieskau took Wolf’s previously hardly heeded songs to many stages throughout the world. Reger was frowned upon as an ‘awkward traditionalist’ and ‘piece worker’, but Reger’s songs show a completely different, moving and profound side of the composer, who takes a significant position in the song composition of the turn of the century. Even Fischer-Dieskau did not devote himself to Reger exactly frequently, unlike his downright encyclopaedic approach in other fields.

But while the early pieces are little more than piano sonatas with violin accompaniments, the more mature works of 1778 begin to integrate the violin and piano parts more closely, and to highlight the growing independence and virtuosity of the violin. Mozart composed several violin sonatas during his stay in Mannheim in 1778. These first mature sonatas reflect some of the ""Sturm und Drang"" atmosphere of the music at the court of Mannheim, which emboldened Mozart to write in a freer and more dramatic mode. Austrian director and violinist Gunar Letzbor studied composition, conducting and violin in Salzburg and Cologne.

Il giardino dei sospiri is a collection of scenes from secular cantatas on tragic love, ranging from Handel’s Qual ti riveggio to new editions of works by Leo (Angelica e Medoro), Marcello (Arianna abbandonata) and Gasparini (Atalia).

Gershwin also forms the centrepiece of this third volume in Giovanni Doria Miglietta’s comprehensive survey of Wild’s own music. The Grand Fantasy on Porgy and Bess works all the best-known themes from the opera into a spectacular half-hour of pianistic devilry and enchantment. Lisztian in scope – and in the use of ‘Reminiscences’ in its title – Reminiscences of Snow White (1995) opens with glistening high-note scales, taking the listener into fairy-tale territories, with fragments of the principal themes of Disney’s movie scattered across the musical texture, most notably ‘Whistle while You Work’. Like Liszt, Wild had the gift of bringing popular music and high art together without compromising either idiom. Miglietta closes this dazzling album with Wild’s outrageously entertaining transcription of Jarabe Tapatio, otherwise known as the Mexican Hat Dance. Before that he plays four reworkings of classical repertoire, all respectful of their originals and yet imbued with Wild’s own effervescent personality: Le Rouet d’Omphale of Saint-Saëns, the Air and Variations from Handel’s harpsichord suite ‘The Harmonious Blacksmith’, and two Tchaikovsky pieces, a song and a dance from Swan Lake. ‘This is tremendously challenging music,’ remarked Fanfare of the first volume in this series containing Wild’s Piano Sonata, ‘and Miglietta certainly has the virtuosity that it requires… Fans of this repertoire will want to hear his perspective — and will eagerly await the rest of the series.’",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=5029365101752&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Germany,2019 Piano Classics,2019 Piano Classics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the period be- tween the two world wars, she studied in Paris with Nadia Boulanger, like so many American, British, and Polish composers, but during her lifetime her reputation rarely translated itself into frequent performances outside her native Poland. Bacewicz had a distinctive creative personality and an intuitive approach to form that rewards close study. Her experience as an orchestral leader and concert violinist informed and enriched the string writing in the string quartets, violin concerts and sonatas which have received some attention on record. However, distinguished pianists such as Krystian Zimerman have recently begun to make a persuasive case for Bacewicz’s piano writing, which may be appreciated at its freest and most demanding in the Second Piano Sonata which brings Morta Grigaliunaite’s recital to a thrilling close. Bacewicz declared that she did not see herself as an innovator but as a progressive composer: ‘Each work completed today becomes the past yesterday.’ Her two sets of etudes tackle different techniques of pianism within clear, often ternary forms, but the imaginative ideas within them hint at her larger works in a similar way to the etudes and mazurkas of her compatriots Chopin and Szymanowski, highlighting her seemingly endless capacity for reinvention. Morta Grigaliunaite also includes in her survey a series of lighter works: the Little Triptych, the Concert Krakowiak, a Children’s Suite and Trois pièces caractéristiques – most of them hardly more than a minute or two in length, yet all bursting with individual ideas which reveal Bacewicz’s own considerable talents as a pianist.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=5029365101837&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Germany,2019 Piano Classics,2019 Piano Classics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In 1895 the new organ was tested and accepted.

The instrument has since been preserved without major interventions.

The 22 movements known by the name of “Water Music” belong to Handel’s most popular orchestral pieces. The composer however did not leave any autographs. Subsequent copies and prints do not always include all of the movements and sometimes they are presented in different orders. Some of the individual movements were probably created at different times. The suite performed on this album demonstrates the tonal contrasts in the overture and the diverse sonatas and dances. Handel could have discovered the form of the concerto grosso, in which a solo concertino was contrasted with the orchestra, in Italy. He had been composing special concerts for organ and in one case for harp and orchestra since 1735 in order to offer these between acts of his oratorio performances. He therefore wrote new concerts in concerto grosso form or compiled them from existing movements for the 1739/40 season in the Lincoln’s Inn Fields Theater.

Anderson integrates traditional instruments with fixed media, live processing, and tuned metals to create pieces that are infinitely malleable. For these compositions, Anderson draws inspiration from poetry, paintings, and some early writings that predict many of the technologies now integrated into daily life. His Route is loosely based on the Emily Dickinson poem, “A Route of Evanescence,” which explores the mesmerizing hummingbird during flight. On Route, one might imagine the interaction between saxophone and electronic playback as representing the hummingbird and its surroundings. Re-Cite was inspired by painter Ellsworth Kelly’s 1951 piece Cite, which used chance practices to create a random arrangement of black and white squares. The quintet for flutes and fixed media, Through-line, refers to a central theme or idea — an invisible thread that runs from the beginning to the end of work. In this instance, the through-line is both the duration lines that are used throughout the piece and a seven-chord progression that is used in the odd numbered sections. Using a duration line set, Outside, Looking In features layers of single line fragments that segue and weave between one another. On this solo piano piece, the composer effectively positions the piano as a percussion rather than string instrument. Both As We May Think and Mechanization were inspired by an article by engineer and inventor Vannevar Bush (1890 – 1974) that appeared in The Atlantic in 1945. In the former, the spoken component of the electronic playback audio derives from an archived interview with the author.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGfyPKNXdSY&feature=youtu.be,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=608410873612&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Avant-Garde,,,2019 Ravello Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nicolas Stocker is on a mission to open our ears for these sounds, shapes and spaces. As band member in Kali, Nik Bartsch’s MOBILE and with Marena Whitcher, Nicolas Stocker has already built his reputation internationally as a differentiated and highly skilled drummer. On this album he distills his wide interest and knowledge of styles, genres and drum techniques to a personal essence and message. Good drummers tune their drum before playing to let it resonate with the room, the music and their own taste. The old joke that a band consists of some musicians and a drummer means actually the opposite of its original negative irony: a drummer is not less but more than a musician. Drummers need to embody the ancient and mystic direct power of the drums combined with a sensibility for abstraction, space and structural consciousness. And they need to feel the musical time naturally in the now but also direct it into the future. The music you hear on this album shows exactly these qualities- a journey between sophisticated grooves and soundscapes of beautiful emptiness.

The melodies are identified with the arrangements by excellent artists such as Claus Ogerman, referring in particularly to those ones produced for the performances of Astrud Gilberto, the orchestral atmospheres proper to the Shirley Bassey's repertory, and the “playful"" evocative ability of Henry Mancini.""",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=8018344114484&medium=phy,04 Adult Contemporary,Easy Listening,Easy Listening|Lounge,Italy,2019 Edizioni Ishtar Srl,2019 Edizioni Ishtar Srl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He was a violin virtuoso with eye-catching executive skills, conductor, composer, impresario in contact with leading intellectuals. His musical production is multifaced. He experimented mainly with duet, trio, string quartet. His music is a perfect mixture of Italian and German tradition (Johann Christian Bach, Johann Stamitz and Manheim School that has typical features of the “Style Galant”). Evidence of this can be found in the Six Duos for Two Violins Op. II (1751), dedicated to Prince Heinrich of Prussia. Giardini’s style is spontaneous, easy to listen to, characterized by freshness and lyricism cantabile, joyous naturalness and refinement. Generally, it appears to be an essential musical writing, coming back to the formal clarity and to the contrapuntal simplicity. It develops a great tonal sensibility, supported by a dynamic rhythmic structure: the pure melody, without ornaments, is becoming increasingly important. The notoriety of his music is verified by Charles Burney: “I find all over Italy that Giardini’s solos are in great repute, and very justly so, as I heard nothing equal to them of kind, on the continent” (The Present State of Music in France and Italy, 1771).",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=8007194107074&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Baroque Era,Italy,2019 Tactus Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The composer considers spatial elements as an integral part of her compositions and relates them with musical structure and sound material. The ensemble installation ‘ins Offene’ is – like Romero writes in the score preface – “a trial to superimpose different spaces and to blend them.“ Another example is the cycle ‘die Wanderung’ (the trek/wandering) where reduced sound material moves through various states, parts and instrumental spaces. Romero uses a broad range of compositional possibilities, which includes rule-based composing techniques as well as aleatory elements, and thereby creates complex musical structures.

But today, in the 21st century, the two worlds which are so very different can come a little closer to each other. We learn, wonder, and discover different cultures, lifestyles, nature, architecture, images and sounds. Fumio Yasuda’s music comes from modern Japan, which already opened up to the West in the 18th century. Yasuda studied classical music with a preference for Karl Amadeus Hartmann. From childhood he grew up with Western pop and jazz music, yet was still deeply rooted in the Japanese tradition. Time, space, and infinity play an important role in his music. In his scores there are no pause signs like in Western music, but signs of silence between lyrical, deeply poetic tones and chords that tell stories about Japanese landscapes, rain, forests, fog, longings and eternity. Yasuda works in a deep musical understanding with Joachim Badenhorst, Nobuyoshi Ino and Akimuse. His gentle piano sounds unite with the sounds of the clarinet, the plucked bass strings, and the tender voice of Akimuse.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=025091025329&medium=phy,02 Jazz,Jazz,Jazz|Contemporary Jazz,Germany,2019 Fumio Yasuda,2019 Winter & Winter GmbH,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Her January performance opening for Branford Marsalis in the 1,800 seat Renée and Henry Segerstrom Concert Hall whet international jazz appetites. She next headlined the Arlington Jazz Festival in Texas, and Yuko Mabuchi Trio performed in Blues Alley in April as part of the Cherry Blossom Festival in Washington D. C. European and Asian stages beckon. Yuko’s debut recording on Yarlung, ""Yuko Mabuchi Trio,"" was a top seller in the Yarlung catalog last year, in all formats. Yuko deserves this success. ""The Absolute Sound"" published a rave review of her Segerstrom concert. Elaborating further, Rick Brown writes in Yarlung News “Yuko Mabuchi combines sexy athleticism at the piano with serious musical poetry. The young fans in the house responded to both with great enthusiasm. So did audience members in their 70s and 80s. This was a fast up tempo set resulting in thunderous applause with audience members yelling and stamping their feet for the standing ovation at the end…. I recognized some audience members who had driven from San Francisco or flown in from Hong Kong and different parts of the country for the event…. “",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuYQ0EO6L-g&feature=youtu.be,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=191924881711&medium=phy,02 Jazz,Jazz|Contemporary Jazz,Jazz|Trad Jazz,United States,2019 Yarlung Records,2019 Yarlung Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
