The American baritone John Chest enjoys a brilliant career that has already led him to Glyndebourne Festival and the BBC Proms. In partnership with the Brazilian pianist Marcelo Amaral, he presents Die sch�ne Magelone by Johannes Brahms. Among all the wealth of Lieder that Brahms composed, this is his only real song cycle. Brahms had known these popular tales since his childhood, but it was thanks to Schumann that he discovered the novel published in 1797 by Ludwig Tieck, entitled The Love Story of the Fair Magelone and Count Peter of Provence. The work is representative of the poetic, idealized reinvention of the Middle Ages so characteristic of German romanticism: stories of star-crossed love, that usually end happily. "What strikes the listener most of all is the song cycle's epic scale - it is a veritable pocket opera, supported by pianistic writing of great complexity," writes Timoth�e Picard in the essay accompanying this release. The album's artwork is an original design by Maia Flore, a laurate photographer of the HSBC Foundation: her poetic universe has already featured in the preceding number of the series, 'Black is the colour' (Alpha 384).",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=ALPHA431&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Austria,2018 Festival d'Aix-en-Provence & Alpha Classics / Outhere Music France,2018 Alpha Classics / Outhere Music France,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In close collaboration with Benoit Dratwicki and the Centre de Musique Baroque de Versailles - which also celebrated its 30th anniversary in 2018 -they have devised an intriguingly unconventional programme idea. Following the example of Louis XIV, who in 1671 asked Lully to create a Ballet of ballets consisting of extracts from the thirty or so ballets that the composer had put on at court, they have conceived 'An Imaginary Opera,' a veritable 'Opera of Operas': around thirty extracts, with well-known repertoire alongside rarities - some completely unknown and unpublished - have been put together to create a plot centered around three dramatic archetypes of the period: a princess in love, a witch queen (her rival) and a courageous prince. All the themes of French baroque opera are illustrated in turn, according to the rules of the genre: battle, tempest, sorcery, love duets, religious invocations, and sleep. The virtuoso arias, dazzling ballets and imposing ceremonial choruses are by Lully and Rameau, naturally - but also by Campra, Marais, Bertin de La Dou�, Destouches, St�ck, Gervais, Colin de Blamont, Rebel, Francoeur, Mont�clair, Leclair and Dauvergne.

For around 150 years France has nurtured a distinctive style of pianism centered on the teaching of the Paris Conservatoire. The heyday of the school was probably the first fifty years of the 20th century and this series of recordings aims to explore in depth the often-forgotten recordings made at this time. Marius-Fran�ois Gaillard was the first pianist to perform the complete piano works of Debussy in concert, which he did first in 1920, and again in 1922. He subsequently made the recordings featured here, and these were by far the largest body of Debussy piano recordings until the 1930s. As such they give us the closest view of Debussy playing to the composer's own time and reveal a clarity and objectivity which exemplifies the traditions of French pianism but is somewhat different from the 'impressionist' style of Gieseking which was to follow and become the accepted model. Gaillard later pursued a career as a composer and his early recordings were forgotten. To commemorate the 100th anniversary year of Debussy's death, this is their first reissue. Carmen Guilbert also had a short active career, but as a pupil of Marguerite Long her playing, particularly of Faur�, is important.

An essential part of Gustav Mahler's work belongs to the lied genre, which, together with the symphony, is one of the two key facets of his output. They are of capital importance in his work because the composer's fusion of the two genres succeeded in breathing new life into both. The 'Lieder eines fahrenden Gesellen' (Songs of a Wayfarer) belong to his early creative period. This cycle of 4 very different melodies, with its obvious similarities to Schubert's Winterreise, relates the story of a dreamy young man who is haunted in his wanderings by the memory of his beloved. He is the very picture of the Romantic Wanderer, portrayed with his existential sorrow, his mood swings, his hopes and his vexations. Fifteen years later, Mahler turned his attention to the poet Friedrich R�ckert in composing his R�ckert-Lieder, which marked an oasis of equilibrium during one of the happiest periods of his life, when he met his future wife, Alma. These superb miniatures translate inner states of mind in which the spirit of the traditional lied blends with that of the art lied. Although it is not a song cycle in the strict sense, it does have an overall unity of tone and mood. Having achieved a measure of perfection in the lied genre, Mahler could subsequently focus on a fusion of the lied and the symphony, a feat that would be realized in 'Das Lied von der Erde' (The Song of the Earth), that vast "symphony of lieder" constructed around a handful of Chinese poems. 'Der Abschied' (The Farewell) is the longest in the work, but it is also the most highly developed, and the music has a beauty, which, like the final words of Mahler's masterpiece that concludes this album, is eternal.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=ARV-014&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Austria,2016 Babsan Productions,2016 Off The Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Improvisation has one advantage over composition in that the interpreter can respond much more directly to each concert situation. That means responding to the concert space, the instrument, the audience's vibes, and especially to the particular emotional state in the room. Composition's advantage is that a composer can fine-tune a piece as long as he needs to, until he believes that it's finished. The risk with improvisation lies in the fact that there is only one temporal opportunity for a tone. There is free-improvisation and improvisation bound to themes; this concert is bound to the musical themes and forms of expression of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. This means that both art forms- improvisation and composition- merge into one another."",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=AS%205080&medium=phy,02 Jazz,Jazz,,Germany,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Certain works are lost; others are erroneously ascribed, or their authenticity at least doubtful. One of the concertos has even been ascribed by different musicologists to Joseph and to Michael Haydn, but it may have been written by another person entirely. The two brothers wrote most of their concertos for the widest variety of solo instruments, but usually in the same type of situation: i.e. once they had assumed important posts at the head of renowned court orchestras. Joseph Haydn became Kapellmeister for the Esterhazy princes in 1761, and Michael became concertmaster of the Salzburg archdiocese court orchestra in 1763.

Now five European composers were additionally asked to quasi-casually prolong Schubert's ambivalences into the present by supplying their own variations. The commission called for works that were to be limited in length, and each composer was asked to focus his attention on a particular instrument. Although all of their pieces are based on the Trout theme, the resulting works vary utterly in terms of character and tempo. As Avenhaus puts it, this is a "godsend." The new compositions can be grasped as individual movements of a contemporary Trout quintet, but one can also combine them in several different ways. The double bass and the cello form a strong bass section in this particular piano quintet. The line-up may have been unusual and difficult to score in terms of timbre, but Schubert skillfully made best of the situation by expanding the range of different sonorities to the maximum. The low strings fathom the underground. Conversely, the piano, often playing in octaves for long stretches in the upper range, carries out the assigned role of shining brightly on the mountain peaks. The middle range is tenderly filled out by the other strings.

And when the time came to perform and record them, what other orchestra could he choose but the Gothenburg Symphony - Stenhammar's 'own' orchestra which he conducted between 1907 and 1922. The works on this disc are possibly the finest orchestral music that Stenhammar composed and he gave the premi�res of both with the orchestra, Symphony No. 2 in 1915 and the revised version of the Serenade in 1920. In fact, he even dedicated the symphony to the members of the orchestra, his 'dear friends'.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=BIS-2424&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Romantic Era,EU,"BIS Records AB, Sweden","BIS Records AB, Sweden",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is easy to forget that he could not have fulfilled his artistic potential if his environment had not been conducive to musical creativity. But much of the music that was part of that environment has been almost completely forgotten, often because its aesthetic didn't accord with the prevailing nationalist trends of the late 19th century. In this programme of choral works, Nils Schweckendiek and his Helsinki Chamber Choir guide us through some 80 years of Finnish music for choir, from the period when the country formed part of the Russian Empire, as the Grand Duchy of Finland. It was during this time that a Finnish nationalist movement began to take form, in opposition towards the political and cultural dominance of Russia and Sweden respectively. This development can be traced in the way the idea of Spring - a staple in the songs of the Nordic countries - changes from a sense of joy at the end to the hardships of winter to a metaphor for liberation from political oppression. Another result was the Fennicization towards the end of the 19th century, during which many popular Swedish and German-language songs were translated into Finnish and the originals in effect suppressed - a case in point being the earliest piece on the disc, F. A. Ehrstr�m's Svanen (The Swan, 1833), which has had it's original Swedish text restored for this recording.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=BIS-2442&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Choral,EU,"BIS Records AB, Sweden","BIS Records AB, Sweden",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With her first release on BIS she offers us a rare opportunity to acquaint ourselves with the music of Hans Erich Apostel, banned as 'degenerate' by the Nazis in 1938, and a rarity in performance ever since. At the same time, her album allows us insight into the interplay between composers and artists in other disciplines during the first decades of the twentieth century, in the context of movements such as Der Blaue Reiter, the arts magazine Der Sturm or the Vienna Workshop. The three works here were inspired by artwork by Otto Kokoschka and Alfred Kubin, two of them appearing on album for the first time. In his Op. 1, the Zehn Variationen, Apostel translates 10 drawings by Kokoschka into sounds - but as Malengreau suggests in her own liner notes, what the music describes is the varying degrees of expressivity and intensity of the drawings, rather than the images themselves. The closing work consists of 60 very brief sketches (less than 40 seconds on average), in which Apostel is reacting to Kubin's drawings (caricatures rather than portraits) of nuns and witches, generals or huntsmen. Apostel completed it in 1948-49, but as early as 1945 it provided material for what is probably his best-known work: the ten pieces that make up the 15-minute long Kubiniana.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=BIS-2405&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Piano,EU,"BIS Records AB, Sweden","BIS Records AB, Sweden",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The concerto is actually Aho's second concertante piece for the trombone - his Symphony No. 9 (1994) included a substantial and very virtuosic solo part for the instrument. In that work, and even more so in the concerto, the composer's aim has been to extend the expressive and virtuosic possibilities of the trombone. Composed around the same time, the Trumpet Concerto is scored for the wind section of a medium-sized symphony orchestra, plus two saxophones, baritone horn and percussion.

It is in no way to be seen as a precursor of the ""Missa solemnis"" but instead as a highly independent work that set new standards for the advancement of mass compositions in the 19th century. Beethoven himself was well aware of its innovative nature, and wrote as much in a letter to his publisher: "I am reluctant to say anything about my Mass, or indeed about myself, but I do believe that I have treated the text in a manner to which it has rarely been treated." For people at the time, the Mass in C major, Op. 86 of 1807 provided unprecedented access to the Christian faith in a way that is still relevant today. This important work from the history of sacred music offers a devotional sound that is simultaneously heartfelt and beautiful. Beethoven's Mass in C major was recorded at two concerts that took place exactly one year ago at the Philharmonie in Gasteig in Munich, on January 11 and 12, 2018. The high-quality performers are Genia K�hmeier (soprano), Gerhild Romberger (alto), Maximilian Schmitt (tenor) and Luca Pisaroni (bass-baritone), together with the Bavarian Radio Chorus and the Symphonieorchester des Bayerischen Rundfunks conducted by Mariss Jansons. These concerts took place on the occasion of Maestro Jansons' 75th birthday.

The study of music and composition spurred the young composer on greatly; his diligence as well as his youthful creativity developed early, and he made astonishing progress. In 1821, he wrote the first half of his string symphonies, which together took less than two years to complete. During performances that formed part of the concerts at home, he always took over the direction of the chamber orchestra, which consisted of amateur and professional musicians from the Berlin court orchestra. Ever since their long-lost manuscripts were successfully rediscovered in 1950, Mendelssohn's early string symphonies have been a fixed part of the string and chamber orchestra repertoire. In the youthful freshness and carefreeness of these early works, one can already hear echoes of the instrumental masterpieces by this important symphonic composer of early Romanticism that were soon to follow. This release contains the first six of Mendelssohn's string symphonies in the form of studio recordings made by the M�nchner Rundfunkorchester under its leader Henry Raudales, a violinist who has won several awards and has made numerous recordings with the orchestra as a conductor and a soloist.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=BRK900324&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Violin,Germany,BRmedia Service GmbH,BRmedia Service GmbH,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This new release in the successful series of BR-KLASSIK audio biographies contains approximately 150 excerpts from Schumann's works; carefully interwoven into his life story, they give voice to his inner world. The mysterious ""inner voice"" that Schumann noted down in the score of his Humoreske op. 20 thus becomes the motto of this audio biography. ""Unknown songs I had never heard flowed through my heart - songs that sounded to me like ghostly voices."" It was this passage from ETA Hoffmann's Kreisleriana that inspired Schumann to write his own Kreisleriana op 16. In February 1854, the composer himself heard such voices - and this marked the start of a journey that would culminate in the mental asylum. Schumann's ""inner voice"" thus represents not only his romantic sensitivity but also his fragile and volatile psyche. Of course, this ten-part audio biography also devotes a lot of room to the relationship between Robert and Clara - probably the greatest ""romantic novel"" of music history. Nothing is exaggerated, however; it is all based on the original sources, which are dramatic and touching enough in themselves. Outstanding actors including Udo Wachtveitl (narrator), Matthias Brandt (Schumann) and Brigitte Hobmeier (Clara) contribute, alongside further narrators, to all the fascinating sounds and colours of this audio biography. Performers such as John Eliot Gardiner, Eric Le Sage and Christian Gerhaher guarantee the highest quality in the musical excerpts, which also feature several rarities.

It is a journey encompassing the various musical traditions along the path taken by the Grail through the centuries, from the Holy Land to Brittany, from the Pyrenees to San Juan de la Pe�a until its ultimate arrival at Valencia Cathedral. The Grail is both legendary and mystical, a holy relic that appeared in stories during the middle part of the mediaeval period. It is a precious and mysterious object in the shape of a plate full of Christian symbolism, like the bloody lance which is reminiscent of the lance thrust into the body of Christ on the cross - the mystery of redemption and eternal life. From Crusade songs, chants sung in pilgrimage centers, mediaeval literature reflected in music, to the emblematic symbolism the Grail acquired with Alfonso the Magnanimous. Towards the end of the Middle Ages when the Turks were circling Constantinople, it seems that the ideal of the Crusades disappears like a dream and only a vague memory of the Grail endures, while Alfonso the Magnanimous proudly displays the Perilous Chair as a heraldic device which glorifies his deeds. Virtud apurar no'm fretura sola (My virtue will not falter until I reach my goal). Capella de Ministrers has gathered together music and poetry from the Middle Ages by authors and composers such as Chre�tien de Troyes, Robert de Boron, Wolfram von Eschembach and He�linand de Froidmont.

The music seduces the listener into letting the imagination run wild and getting lost in thought. One floats around and plunges into remote worlds to discover familiar sounds in new surroundings.

Half a century later, his words had never felt more pertinent. Every composer writing during World War I found a unique way, through their music, to describe and protest against the horrors that were tearing civilization apart. Created in the depth of morbidity, Debussy's parting musical gift is a subtle, dignified, and heroic celebration of youth and joie de vivre. A sense of patriotism in the war years links Debussy with the foremost Moravian composer of the day, Leos Janacek. Ottorino Respighi was only in his thirties when the war broke out. His 1917 Sonata for violin and piano is a work of Romance written in the time of hate, a reminder that the past and the future remain beacons of hope in desperate times. Commissioned for this recital programme to reflect on the centenary of The Great War from our own times, Kenneth Hesketh's Inscrizione, derivate, subtitled 'A lie to the Dying,' is a quasi-meditation on the dying man, his anxious thoughts and the spasms of his failing heart being weaved conspicuously into a narrative of disquieting melancholy.

The poet uses forms fixes, the canonized forms of French songs of the late medieval times: ballades, rondeaus and virelais, and the wide variety of the forms used is remarkable.

The year 1808 was a period of superlative productivity for Beethoven: in the midst of all this, Beethoven somehow found the time and energy to compose two major piano trios. They were completed while Beethoven was living with Countess Marie Erdody, to whom the trios were also dedicated. Some previous piano trios were rather lengthy affairs with pretentions to the symphonic repertoire, but the opening movement of op. 70 no. 1 immediately lets the listener know that this time, things are different. The piece starts seemingly in medias res with a tempestuous figure in all three instruments at the same time. The second movement is the one that gave the trio its nickname 'ghost.' Carl Czerny, Beethoven's student, seems to have been the first to use this name. According to him, the movement 'resembles an appearance from the underworld. One could think not inappropriately of the first appearance of the ghost in Hamlet.' Superficially, the sibling of the 'Ghost' may seem closer to Haydn and Mozart in style. For a long time, the Variations no. 44 were known as 'Variations on an Original Theme,' as the first publication did not name the theme. It has since been identified as a theme by Dittersdorf. The variations were presumably written in 1792 and published in 1804, when various other early works were being offered to publishers.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=CC%2072781&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Austria,2018 Challenge Classics,2018 Challenge Classics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During his younger years Herzogenberg was very much attracted to Wagner and the "New German" style - which also had an impact on his Columbus. He designed his musical occupation with this subject in an innovative manner, producing a work that is a combination of the stage and concert genres. Like Wagner, he wrote the libretto himself and did so while following the model provided by the typical four-part sequence of a drama with a presentation, an intensification, a climactic or turning point, and a resolution. After the successful premiere a review appeared in the Grazer Tagespost that is all the more interesting insofar as it was penned by Friedrich Hausegger, a member of the "progressive camp." If we think merely of Herzogenberg as the Brahms emulator of his middle and later creative phases, then Hausegger's words correct our one-sided picture of the composer: "We were most pleasantly surprised by his Columbus. With it the composer proved not only that he can assemble little elements, perhaps ones formed in imitation, to produce a well-formed whole but also that he can draw on impressive resources, that he is able to master a significant subject with a bold and sure hand." Unlike his later practice with his model Brahms, in his Columbus Herzogenberg did not end up following Wagner to the extreme stylistically. However, it is precisely his thoroughly independent as well as inspired musical treatment of this subject that is a source of special fascination.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=555178-2&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Cantata,Germany,2018 cpo,2018 cpo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Once again Ries proves to be a master and in retrospect a pathbreaking composer who today is a rewarding rediscovery. Throughout his life the Beethoven pupil Ries occupied himself with the composition of string quartets and string quintets. His String Quintet No. 2 received virtually hymnic praise in the Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung in 1817: it was "in every respect one of the most outstanding works by this composer; in fact it even ranks with the most outstanding works of all that have come out in this genre for a number of years." In this work Ries apparently hit on the blend of traditional and innovative elements corresponding to the expectations of discriminating listeners from his times. In his Quartet No. 5 Ries creates the impression both of greater delight in experimentation and concision as far as the formal and motivic-thematic design of the work is concerned and proves to be a master in the field of formal experiments. The Schuppanzigh Quartet, which with the performance of interesting new discoveries has earned a reputation as one of the leading string quartets playing on original instruments, interprets these individual and suspenseful quartets, once again "with a lot of �lan and dedication" (FonoForum of Vol. 1).",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=777305-2&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Chamber Music,Germany,2018 cpo,2018 cpo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our third release featuring this uncommonly versatile composer presents his Concertos for Piccolo and Harpsichord. As in many of his concertos for solo instruments and orchestra, here too Papandopulo draws on neoclassical, that is, Baroque, sources in his Harpsichord Concerto. The three characteristic movements follow the model fast-slow-fast in their sequence. In the introductory cantata the composer incorporates dodecaphonic features into the musical structure in a most highly individual and original manner in order then to blend them with compositional-technical elements of the Baroque. He employed the piccolo in many ways his works. It usually enables him to evoke nature with musical means - the country idyll, the sounds of shepherd's pipes and birdcalls, and the stylized folk dance. Such a sunny, idyllic, Arcadian atmosphere also radiates throughout the Prelude with its stylized birdsong forming the beginning of the Little Concerto. His orchestral songs round off the album. Papandopulo's music concentrates as much as possible on the text in these little genre pictures, a fact reflected in his thoroughly recitative treatment of the words as well as in his neo-impressionistic compositional technique. This tonal coloration is shown not only in the subtle chords of the harp but also in his frequent use of bitonal sound layers.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=777941-2&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Germany,2018 cpo,2018 cpo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Graupner sought opportunities for original expression and was open to the latest developments and to unfamiliar instruments. With his inexhaustible imagination he was able to create cantatas rich in contrasts and with variability, originality, diversified instrumentation, special tone color opulence, intelligent voice leading, and drama schooled on the opera as their hallmarks. The interplay of the vocal and instrumental parts is also a special feature of his music. In the introduction to his Hymnbook published in 1728 Graupner emphasized what in his view was the most important task facing a composer: "Edifying words in a song make an even deeper impression on human hearts when the meaning and message of the text, as it were, are vividly presented through the music with carefully considered and select expressions. And this is the noblest thing in every composition in which specific texts and words are prescribed." In his cantatas Graupner succeeded in employing purposeful musical affections to illustrate and represent the texts. For him there was no difference between secular and sacred music; he knew how to engage in skillful negotiations between these two genres.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=555215-2&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Cantata,Germany,2018 cpo,2018 cpo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, our previous two releases featuring this composer's symphonies clearly show that he belonged to a generational group including Richard Wetz, Wilhelm Berger, Felix Weingartner, and Paul Juon whose members exercised due caution in the further development of the classical-romantic tradition, each one in his own way, and specifically enriched the generic history of the symphony with important nuances. Woyrsch's Symphony No. 4 is about the same length as his third such work but in contrast to it built on melodic ideas of greater concision not rarely generating sharp contrasts within a short space. It is a work of abrupt changes and unforeseen modulations. In his Symphony No. 5 Woyrsch very much continues on the path taken by him in his earlier symphonies, though here he presents his ideas in extraordinarily concentrated form. He prescribes an orchestral ensemble almost just as large as the one in the fourth symphony but its dimensions are clearly more compact. "And again something of compelling force emanates from this music."

They have also been transmitted in all sorts of different ways. The spectrum ranges from extant autographs and original printed editions leaving no doubt about Kuhnau's authorship to copies from what was clearly a later time or sources from rather peripheral lines of transmission in which the materials themselves as well as the stylistic findings offer reasons for critical skepticism about the ascription of the works to Kuhnau. The most reliable sources as far as authenticity is concerned are those for the two burial songs "Gott hat uns nicht gesetzt zum Zorn" and "Ach, Gott, wie l�sst du mich verstarren." These two works are from Kuhnau's early period but nonetheless pieces of great artistic mastery and have to be regarded as model examples of the church style that exercised an absolutely enormous influence on the formation of the church styles of Bach, Handel, and Telemann.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=555190-2&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Cantata,Germany,2018 cpo,2018 cpo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The oratorios are new discoveries and premiere recordings. Even if the works concerned are of cantata length, the term "Oratorio" is in this case perfectly justified. Not only the soprano, alto, and other vocal parts sing but also personified allegories such as Faith, Hope, and Love. Telemann's musical realization of the poetic sources of the writer and musician Albrecht Jacob Zell is distinguished by great imagination and subtle artistry. The affections and emotions contained in the texts penned by Zell and the Biblical texts inserted by him in the arias and choruses are developed logically and with great feeling: here Telemann employs and combines the whole spectrum of compositional techniques at his command.

The contrast to his first Violin Sonata of 1807, a work of his youth, could hardly be greater: reconsideration of Mozartian rhetoric and compositional technique mark this work pulsing with astonishing kinetic energy and with a concertante character for the most part embodied by the piano, while the violin part instead is assigned more the role of brilliant commentary or pointed interaction. Kolja Lessing himself wrote the booklet text and expresses the greatest thanks to Anton Kuerti - not only for his tireless research, investigation, and revival of Czerny's colossal oeuvre but also just as much for his meticulous transcription of what in part are Czerny's difficult-to-decipher manuscripts into modern notation.

The legendary female figure with her seductive beauty today no longer haunts the river, but her story continues to resonate in the imagination. In 1861, when he was a mere twenty years old, Max Bruch, a Rhinelander born in Cologne, devoted an opera to the Loreley, a work based on a libretto by the great Emanuel Geibel himself. This opera in four acts is only rarely performed and until now has never been recorded on album. The Munich Radio Orchestra will now change this state of affairs: in a concert performance initiated by cpo the orchestra presented the work under the conductor Stefan Blunier, who was the General Music Director of the City of Bonn - that is, in the vicinity of the Loreley - when the recording was produced. The marvelous Michaela Kaune interpreted the title role in a top-quality performance, and Thomas Mohr was her male counterpart. Bruch set the Loreley story, in which everything, both in ambience and action, constituting a "Grand Romantic Opera" (thus the work's subtitle) is present, in a highly romantic musical language.

Although he is hardly known today, he enjoyed great esteem during his lifetime. The lion's share of De Macque's oeuvre is formed by madrigals for four to six voices. Moreover, he composed pieces known as madrigaletti (the diminutive refers to the smaller ensemble and the �lighter tone� of the content and the music), a collection of Latin motets for up to eight voices, and instrumental works, some of which are heard in a representative cross section on this release. All of the pieces heard here are from the Sesto libro de madrigali de cinque voci, which was printed in Venice in 1613, a year prior to De Macque's death. The collection covers a broad spectrum of verbal and musical registers. The texts set to music draw on Arcadian mythological topoi and also treat moralizing and religious themes. Carefree delight and the vivifying power of nature as well as lover's grief, despair, and sorrow - De Macque expresses all these feelings, situations, and impressions in his pieces. His madrigals may also be said to exhibit a considerable thematic and stylistic variety.

Here he met, among others, the famous harpsichordist and composer Domenico Scarlatti who composed over five hundred and fifty harpsichord sonatas. Soler also added no less than one hundred and forty four to the sonata genre - usually in one movement. The relationship between the two is evident in Soler's style e.g., the re-emergence of musical elements, structures sub-divided with repetitions and the use of Spanish folk music. Form and content suggest that it is not music for a church with two oppositely placed organs, but rather for courtly entertainment performed in a hall at the El Escorial monastery. On the present recording, we have chosen two historical instruments which are immensely colorful and offer enough tonal possibilities to distinguish the two parts in any desired situation. In addition, both organs represent the sound aesthetic and richness in color of Spanish music of the mid-18th century. The presence of echo manuals and external Nave facades has also added a new dimension to performing echoes, responses and continuo playing. The splendor of the reeds allows the works to emerge out of the niche of their chamber music character. The two historical organs of the Catedral Metropolitana have reopened and revitalized the cosmos of the score. Yet grander and even more beautiful and powerful: this is the first impression of the two organs, and certainly of those who commissioned the instruments, displaying their tremendous wealth and overwhelming power. And yet the organ builder, Joseph Francisco Nassarre Cimorra succeeded in fitting the two instruments harmoniously within the choir; the sheer size of the room even makes them appear filigree.",www.cybele.de/padre-antonio-soler-6-conciertos-fur-2-orgeln,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=Cybele%20SACD%20031802&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Sacred,Germany,2018,2018,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Later, the pianist Haider, who became familiar with European music tradition at a conservatory and African-American jazz aesthetics thanks to working with countless US luminaries, composed waltzes for all his wives; he married a total of three times. Now, he is continuing to "waltz further" into the end of time. At any rate, this is suggested by the title of his sixth trio album, Waltz For Ever, which oscillates between wisdom and power. Haider, a Swiss national by choice, is accompanied on this wonderfully varied album by two Swiss jazz musicians, who were born in 1980 (Claudio Struby) and 1982 respectively (Raffaele Bossard).

The choral and vocal-instrumental compositions by Lukaszewski, recorded on the album, constitute a fragment of his varied and rich works. Lukaszewski's art is characterized by a diversified use of compositional techniques. His works are distinguished by the free use of various compositional techniques, they are unique due to the excellent technique; they are often aphoristic. Lukaszewski's musical language followed the path of evolution typical of the composers of his generation and developed from neoclassical inspirations, through sonoristic regulation with the use of aleatoric techniques and freely treated dodecaphony up to gradual reduction of the sound language and searching for own forms of creative expression.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=DUX1483&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Poland,2018 DUX Recording Producers,2018 DUX Recording Producers,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These repertoire icons are coupled with Dino Lipatti's crystalline Concertino in the Classical Style (1936), which sheds neo-classical light on the vintage idiom. Libeer's fusion of older and newer worlds is not limited to the programme of this release. Although Les M�tamorphoses typically play on modern instruments (albeit with the greatest possible respect for the respective sonorities of different eras), they engaged natural horns and wooden transverse flutes for period color and crisp. The solo piano also represents the best of both worlds: the Concert grand with parallel strings (which Chris Maene originally built for Daniel Barenboim) combines pianoforte possibilities - clearly distinguishable voices and color across registers - with the technical advantages and playing comfort of a modern Steinway.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=EPRC0029&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,,,2018 EPRC 0029,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In Bosque M�gico the oboe adapts what until now has only been used in classical music into a completely unusual context. Improvisations, inspired by classical Indian music, flamenco, pop and jazz, are fused into this instrument and open a rarely heard sound cosmos. Ralf Siedhoff understands the guitar more and more as an orchestra. Through his individual manual skills via his right hand - a mix of flamenco and jazz technic - he gives a distinctive and impulsive rhythm to the compositions.

Everything could go on like this, if a sordid news story did not upset everything. In Austria, a teenager films himself torturing three of these Emachs. On the internet, the video is a buzz. Dr. Wells, at the origin of the project, then realizes that his creatures are not considered as human beings. He is actively campaigning for the great people of this world to change their point of view on these mini-humans and give them rights. For their part, the Emachs take the Maquis and come into resistance...

In 1990, Gy�rgy Kurt�g composed a trio in homage to Schumann - a way of straddling the centuries and opening up a dialogue between two styles, of reviving the imaginary figures and short contrasting forms with which we are familiar in Schumann. So it seemed an obvious idea to build a programme around these two composers.

This renowned orchestra took the decision - following the death, some years back, of Frans Br�ggen - to retain its founder's dynamic process of alternating concert tours with recordings. And dispensing with the need for having a principal conductor, the orchestra now works with a range of musicians according to the repertoire being performed.

De Rore was a Fleming who enjoyed great success notably in the Italian courts of Ferrara and Parma - but with a prestige which extended up and across Europe. He composed in many genres, but it is the secular madrigal - recorded here - where his skill was most valued, for example in creating extended and expressive melodic lines coupled with innovatory pre-echoes of the seconda pratica so triumphantly expressed - albeit amidst great criticism - by Claudio Monteverdi. Recordings - all also on Glossa - of madrigals by Marenzio, Gesualdo and Monteverdi have already demonstrated musical pleasures such as an uncommon vocal blend and delicacy, and a meticulous dynamic control exhibited by the richly-experienced members of La Compagnia del Madrigale, and those delights are to be experienced with these 19 madrigals by Cipriano de Rore, composed late in his career. With texts by Petrarch, Ariosto and assorted court poets for these madrigals, essay-writer Marco Bizzarini highlights one of the principal characteristic features of de Rore's mastery when he points to the disc's title track, Vieni, dolce Imeneo: the ideal union between poetry and music.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=GCD922808&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Austria,2018 Note 1 Music,2018 Note 1 Music,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This tendency has at times led to Brahms being labelled a "conservative". During the second half of the 19th century, a period that saw Richard Wagner's music drama and Franz Liszt's symphonic poems keep the German music scene on tenterhooks, Brahms continued to fly the flag for chamber music in the Classical tradition. Two works from this field are presented on this recording: the two sonatas for cello and piano (interestingly, they were originally called sonatas for "piano and cello" like Beethoven's sonatas op. 69 and op. 102). In both works, Brahms ingeniously and steadfastly continues the Classical tradition and enriches it with new ideas. What is once again evident here is how the composer contrives to align each of his works with the character of the performing instruments. In the sonatas, Brahms primarily draws on deep, baritonal registers, both in lyrical passages and at dramatic, energetic moments.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=HC17060&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Germany,2018 haenssler classic; Profil Medien GmbH,2018 haenssler classic; Profil Medien GmbH,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On the summer and winter solstices the sun "turns", and on the spring and autumn equinoxes the day and night are the same length. The work Tidekverv presents new vocal and instrumental folk music composed for, and dedicated to, the sun's four important days. Two of Norway's most prominent folk musicians created this distinctive work. Berit Opheim is one of the country's foremost folk singers, and has in the past few years performed on stages in Norway, Europe and Asia as a member of Trio Medi�val and as a soloist. She has been associated with the Ole Bull Academy in Voss since 1992. Benedicte Maurseth started playing the Hardanger fiddle at the age of eight, under the instruction of Knut Hamre, and specializes in the traditional music of Hardanger. The work Tidekverv was inspired by the medieval visionary poem "Draumkvedet", both as a form of poetry and as type of musical ritual, as the ballad was mainly performed on the 13th day of Christmas every year. The two composers wanted to pay homage to an older form of poetry, the Nordic ballad, by writing new folk music, and they perform the work primarily in the periods of the equinoxes and solstices. The melodic material was composed by Opheim and Maurseth, but was adapted and arranged with the valuable help and enthusiasm of their musical colleagues Rolf Lislevand and H�kon M�rch Stene. Lislevand is well known as a lutenist and performer of early music. He has participated in many of Jordi Savall's projects, and heads his own group, Ensemble Kapsberger.

Like a deft clockmaker, Andreyev is not stumbling around with too many parcels, weaving in and out of traffic, exploring the vocabulary of lens flares, pots and stains. Music with no Edges suggests the inevitable logic of the accidental machinery. Samuel Andreyev is a composer, oboist, poet and teacher. His music is performed, broadcast, recorded and written about worldwide, and is known for its expressive intensity, spirit of exploration and enormous range of timbres. Resolutely independent, his compositional process is marked by a rigourous perfectionism, with many projects taking years to reach completion. Samuel Andreyev studied composition with Allain Gaussin in Paris, then at the Conservatoire de Paris, where he obtained a masters degree in composition under Fr�d�ric Durieux, and a prix d'analyse under Claude Ledoux. He also studied electroacoustics at IRCAM from 2011-12. His composition Night Division was awarded the grand prix of the Concours Henri Dutilleux in 2012. In the same year, he was awarded a one-year residency at the Casa de Vel�zquez in Madrid.

Here we have collected marches that differ in origin, character, and importance. They are marches that we like to play and hear, and, we hope, that you the listener will appreciate." (Leif Arne Pedersen, conductor) Humans are the only animal species capable of moving as one body in time to dance or march music. When the Ottomans conquered parts of southern Europe in the fourteenth century, they had elite soldiers marching in the lead and playing on shawms and numerous percussion instruments. Known as Janissaries in Turkish, they were the first to call attention to march music. The march was to gradually develop into a piece of music in set form featuring easily recognizable melodies and countermelodies and based on eight and sixteen-measure periods. Many marches came to be regarded as military marches used both in war and peacetime. John Philip Sousa declared that he "would rather be the composer of an inspired march than of a manufactured symphony."

This is why in this "recital" recording, we have gone a bit off the beaten track and taken some liberties. In "Carillion" and "Sonata B major" the bass recorder is used, though it is not actually an instrument associated with solo work. It is, however, a variety of woodwind that Telemann was not unfamiliar with, as he used it in "Trauer Actus" and hints at it in the title "Bassoun o Flaut 4," loosely translated as "bassoon flute," playing an octave over the bassoon...We have also allowed Johann Friedrich Fasch, who had a deep admiration for Telemann, to join the party, With a reverent nod to his role model, he has provided us with a bassoon sonata. Finally, I have taken the liberty to incorporate 2 pieces by Frenchman Jean Daniel Braun into one of Telemann's flute fantasies, the result being an approximation of a classic suite in five movements."",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=LWC1158&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,,2018 Lawo Classics,2018 Lawo Classics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A child prodigy, Hyde's musical education began at an early age with her mother as her first teacher. After gaining the Bachelor of Music at the Elder Conservatorium of Music, University of Adelaide, she won the Elder Overseas Scholarship in 1931 for study at the Royal College of Music, London from 1932-35. Undoubtedly, Miriam Hyde is best known for her piano works for students ranging from beginner to advanced, such as Valley of Rocks, but what of her songs? Often overlooked these charming, often inspirational and personal works evoke Hyde's love of nature, of the landscape, of emotions, of life itself. A lover of the English language and its poetry and a writer of hundreds of poems herself, Hyde's choice of poets is an eclectic one, ranging from the well-known to the obscure, the composer preferring to set words that have meaning and passion for her rather than what will appeal to the commercial market. The songs on this release represent 50 years of Hyde's writing, the first Dream Land written in 1933 and Yorkshire Picture in 1982. Thirteen poets are represented in this collection, including the composer herself.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=SRCD378&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Opera,United Kingdom,2019 Lyrita Recorded Edition,2019 Lyrita Recorded Edition,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2019,Mack Avenue Records,MAC1146,673203114623,Jazz Bata,Chucho Valdes: Jazz Bata 2,Chucho Valdes,1,CD,14.03,21.99,"Jazz Bat� 2, Chucho Vald�s' first album for Mack Avenue Records, marks a new peak of creativity for the artist, even as it revisits the small-group concept of his 1972 Cuban album Jazz Bat�. That album upon release was originally considered experimental at the time, but the trio project - featuring no drum set and two virtuosi who would subsequently be charter members of Irakere would now be considered contemporary. Recorded in two and a half days at John Lee's studio in New Jersey, Jazz Bat� 2 is both rhythmic and lyrical at once. The six-hand complexity of the bat� repertoire permeates Vald�s' piano solos throughout the album. "I applied to my solos the different rhythms of the bat�," he says. "The piano is of course a harmonic instrument, but it's percussive too, and you can play percussion with it." Vald�s set the bat�-driven small-group format aside in the wake of Irakere's explosive popularity in 1973, but he's always wanted to get back to it. Now he's done it with Jazz Bat� 2, "with more resources, in every sense," he says, "with a wider panorama." It's an exceptionally tight band. All of the three supporting musicians are from the Guant�namo region and have deep roots in Cuban musical culture as well as being conservatory-trained. Yelsy and Dreiser grew up together, went through music school together, graduated together, and have been playing music side-by-side literally all their lives. Yaroldy, who plays a wide variety of drums has been working with Vald�s for twenty years. "He always knows what I'm going to want to do," says Vald�s. Jazz Bat� 2 also marks the centenary of Vald�s' father and teacher, Ram�n "Bebo" Vald�s (1918-2013). These two giants of Cuban music shared a birthday - October 9 - so Bebo's 100th will be Chucho's 77th. Between the two of them, they've exercised a massive musical influence since the 1940s. Bebo's 1952 creation of the commercially failed but artistically successful batanga was a direct inspiration for the bat�-driven jazz of Irakere, as well as for Jazz Bat� and its sequel being released 46 years later. This stretch of time reinforces the enduring and magnificent career Vald�s has cultivated over the 77 years of his life, with no signs of slowing down and never one to conform or expand the boundaries of his musical inventions.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=MAC1146&medium=phy,02 Jazz,Jazz,Jazz|Latin Jazz,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two years later, Burton left his studies at Berklee College of Music to join George Shearing and subsequently Stan Getz, with whom he worked from 1964-1966. As a member of Getz's quartet, Burton won Down Beat magazine's Talent Deserving of Wider Recognition award in 1965. By the time he left Getz to form his own quartet in 1967, Burton had also recorded three albums under his name for RCA. Borrowing rhythms and sonorities from rock music, while maintaining jazz's emphasis on improvisation and harmonic complexity, Burton's first quartet attracted large audiences from both sides of the jazz-rock spectrum. Such albums as Duster and Lofty Fake Anagram established Burton and his band as progenitors of the jazz fusion phenomenon.

For their first album, these young soloists boldly launched head first into the vast repertoire of two of the greatest Russian composers: Tchaikovsky and Shostakovich. The two quartets performed here were composed almost a century apart. Tchaikovsky was at the height of his powers and had yet to write his most famous works when he composed his String Quartet No. 2. Throughout his life he was to refer to it as one of his best works, the music having "poured effortlessly and joyfully, being written practically at one sitting." Shostakovich's String Quartet No. 8 was written in Dresden in 1960 and was dedicated "to the victims of fascism and war." At the time he composed the piece, Shostakovich was going through a troubled period both in his personal life and in his relations with the Soviet authorities. The composer was so satisfied with this clearly autobiographical piece that he subsequently dedicated it to himself. The musicians of the David Oistrakh Quartet throw themselves body and soul into this incredibly poignant and intense music.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=MU-011&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Austria,2016 Off The Records,2016 Off The Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

His teacher, the renowned pianist and educator Eduardo del Pueyo, gave the go-ahead to his young student, who had just finished his studies at the Conservatory, to take part in a competition whose past laureates had included pianists such as Leon Fleisher, Maria Tipo, Vladimir Ashkenazy, and Lazare Behrman- in the wake of the first prize awarded in 1937 to Emil Gilels.

He presented a balanced programme- much of which is contained on this album- that perfectly showcased his qualities.

Together they explore in this first album a broad, cosmopolitan repertory from several centuries, in which the virtuosity of the language of the violin is amplified by the technical evolution that blossomed in the late 18th century and by the emotion that different composers sought to put into music. The Russian repertory predominates in this recording with the famous Vocalise of Rachmaninov as well as three works of Tchaikovsky, all composed within three years of each other. In the French repertory, two composers with quite similar musical styles and ideas are on the programme: Maurice Ravel with his highly daunting concert rhapsody Tzigane and Claude Debussy with his tender Clair de Lune. The programme, however, begins in Italy with two emblematic representatives of the virtuoso violin, Tartini and Paganini.

The First Sonata dates from 1865 and was written in Denmark; full of inspired freshness, it is characterized by melodic purity and is ever in song. The Second, composed two years later, corresponds to Grieg's return to Norway and his marriage; the composer expresses here a honeymoon: there is love and of course dance, the central figure of Grieg's music. Another 20 years would pass before the Third Sonata was born after a difficult gestation; no doubt the most often played albeit the most demanding, the folklore is secondary to a more adventurous expressive research, to more elaborate harmonies and some uncommon displays of power. The Latvian violinist Vineta Sareika- first violin of the Artemis Quartet- and the French pianist Amandine Savary have been partners on the most prestigious concert platforms, both of them at the time founding members of the Trio Dali.

Following the group's first album, Daniel Isoir and his ensemble now offer their interpretation of works that have often been featured in their concert programmes: the two piano quartets. A fusion of the concerto and the quartet, these works are rarely performed and there are surprisingly few recordings available of them, particularly on period instruments. Concerto-like in form and built on a dialogue between the piano and the string trio, they unfold in the more private, secluded and intimate atmosphere of chamber music, whilst retaining the extrovert brilliance of the concerto. The quartet for piano, violin, viola and cello was a completely new ensemble at the end of the 18th century and in fact was invented by Mozart himself. Dating from 1785 and 1786, and therefore contemporary with The Marriage of Figaro, these two piano quartets formed part of a series of three commissioned by the publisher Franz Anton Hoffmeister. However, Hoffmeister's difficulty in 'selling' the first quartet, which was judged to be technically too demanding for amateur musicians, led him to abandon the project, although he agreed to let the composer keep the advance on his fee. In these two quartets Mozart achieves a perfect balance between the piano and the strings, the instruments now combining, now alternating throughout the score. At times, the fortepiano plays alone, albeit fleetingly. The first quartet is more tragic than the second, while the latter has greater luminosity and warmth. This permanent conversation with the strings is undoubtedly enriched by the roundness of tone of Daniel Isoir's fortepiano. But the pleasure in listening to these two masterpieces of chamber music also stems from the perfect balance and melodious dialogue between the four exceptional musicians who make up La Petite Symphonie.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=MU-010&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Austria,2016 Off The Records,2016 Off The Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The concert in 1933 at which her Symphony No. 2 in E minor was premiered was the first time a major American orchestra had performed a piece written by an African American woman. Influenced by Dvorak and Coleridge-Taylor, she drew on the wellspring of Negro spirituals and vernacular dances, full of lyricism and syncopation. The Symphony No. 4 in D minor demonstrates her tight ensemble writing, her distinct sense of orchestral color, her Ellingtonian 'jungle style' language and her penchant for the 'juba' dance. Founded in 1923, the Fort Smith Symphony is the oldest orchestra in the state of Arkansas. The orchestra is a per-service professional ensemble drawn from musicians throughout the region. The orchestra performs classics, pops and educational concerts in the ArcBest Performing Arts Center in downtown Fort Smith.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=8559827&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,,(C)Naxos,(C)Naxos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Financial prospects at first seemed better in Gothenberg than in his native country, while the dual influences of Berlioz and Liszt were informing the direction of his music. Richard III is not a programmatic drama, but focuses instead on the haunting scene before the Battle of Bosworth in Shakespeare's play. Wallenstein's Camp is symphonically structured, while Hakon Jarl dramatizes the life of the tyrannical Viking warrior with memorable flair. The Slovak Philharmonic Orchestra was established in 1949 by the esteemed conductors Vaclav Talich and L'udovit Rajter.

His encyclopedic approach to technique is shown at its most dazzling in this cycle, heard here in the 1852 revision which Liszt himself declared 'the only authentic one.' Integration of musical and technical elements is absolute, and the music's narratives are supported by dramatic physicality, an orchestral richness of sonority, and an exceptional coloristic quality. The young Moscow-born Israeli pianist Boris Giltburg is lauded across the globe as a deeply sensitive, insightful and compelling musician. Born in 1984 in Moscow, he moved to Tel Aviv at an early age, studying with his mother and then with Arie Vardi. He went on to win numerous awards, most recently the Second Prize at the Rubinstein Competition in 2011, and in 2013 he won First Prize at the Queen Elisabeth Competition, catapulting his career to a new level.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=8573981&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,,(C)Naxos,(C)Naxos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A central theme of the songs is the archetypical Romantic focus on the portrayal of nature as a reflection of human feelings. The youthful and enduringly popular Ist der Himmel darum im Lenz so blau (Is the sky so blue in the spring) reflects his greatest qualities as a song composer- a memorable tune and rich, flowing harmonies. Favoring the bold use of color, Pfitner's songs are characterized by a lively, pulsing rhythm and sweeping, ecstatic melodies. Tenor Colin Balzer has sung acclaimed recitals in London, New York, and Philadelphia, and concerts with the Portland, New Jersey, Toronto, Quebec, Atlanta, Montreal, and Indianapolis Symphony Orchestras as well as other notable ensembles across North America.

Silvestre Revueltas's 'La Noche de los mayas' is a symphonic suite derived from film music that employs Mexican percussion instruments in a vividly inventive way. The process of linking folk influence with classical techniques continues to the present day with Hebert Vazquez's 'El arbol de la vida' which uses the folk style known as the 'son.' Mexican guitarist Pablo Garibay has established himself as a leading force on the international classical guitar scene with a repertoire that includes the great guitar concertos, notably those by Rodrigo, Castelnuovo-Tedesco, Ponce, and Villa-Lobos.

These solo and chamber works offer an overview of his career, from the poignant Estancias to the Mediterranean-influenced Trio en miniaturas which also represents Ruiz-Pipo's fascination with the music of antiquity. Infused with elements of French lyricism and sultry Spanish moods, Ruiz-Pipo's complex but humane musical idiom is richly deserving of discovery. Internationally acclaimed guitarist Wolfgang Weigel was born in 1954 in Saarbrucken. He studied at the music academies of Saarbrucken and Lubeck between 1970 and 1975, and later he became close friends with guitarist Karl Scheit in Vienna who became his artistic mentor.

The dating of his Six Duets is the subject of speculation, but their level of technical sophistication is quite remarkable. Each instrument is given equal status in music that is full of the kind of joyous brilliance, passion and free-mindedness of spirit that transcends virtuosity and the stylistic boundaries of W.F.

From the age of 17 he studied the flute with Jean-Pierre Rampal at the Paris Conservatoire, and at the age of 21 was appointed principal flute in the Orchestre national de France. Today, he has a wide repertoire both as a conductor and a flautist, with a predilection for contemporary music. Kazunori Seo was born in Japan in 1974. He began his music studies first with his parents, and then in Paris at the Paris Conservatoire where he was awarded the Premier Prix in flute in 1998.

He writes in the liner notes that, "The quotations are treated to processes of assimilation, integration, disintegration, and segregation while moving freely between clear borders and gradual transitions.

The single Sonatensatz (Scherzo) was not published till after Brahms' death. The piece is originally for violin and piano and formed the third movement of a full-length four movement sonata by three different composers, Schumann, Dietrich his student, and the youthful Brahms. This is the only movement still regularly performed. It certainly makes a strong, effective recital piece. More than twenty years separate the two cello sonatas. While the first, in E minor is generally rather somber, often very low-lying on the cello and serious in its Bachian working-out, the second, in F major is full of turbulent, confident, even heroic qualities. It presents both players at full throttle, strutting proudly through one noble melody after another, and then - in the radically remote and radiant key of F sharp major - has one of Brahms' most glorious slow movements and a dark scherzo which paraphrases the opening theme from his 3rd symphony's finale. These two sonatas for cello and piano have achieved a legendary position - wonderful and powerful expressions of 19th century romanticism.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=NI5972&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Cello,United Kingdom,2019 Wyastone Estate Limited,2019 Wyastone Estate Limited,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Armas J�rnefelt - today largely known in music literature only as Sibelius' brother-in-law - became one of the most remarkable Finnish orchestral composers during the 1890s. The composer wrote several symphonic poems and orchestral suites in his young age which were highly successful and widely performed by various orchestras in his home country. However, for reasons unknown, J�rnefelt decided to devote himself to conducting. In the years to follow, J�rnefelt moved to Sweden and become a highly-esteemed conductor. Some of J�rnefelt's miniatures became hits for salon orchestras in Europe, such as his Berceuse, but this recording makes more justice to a largely forgotten Nordic composer. In 1919, Finnish-born film director Mauritz Stiller approached Armas J�rnefelt and commissioned him to write an orchestral score for his silent film 'Song of the Scarlet Flower' (S�ngen om den eldr�da blomman), based on a novel by Finnish author Johannes Linnankoski. J�rnefelt made great efforts for the project and as a result, wrote a large 100-minute orchestral score. The work can be considered as his final orchestral masterpiece and a pioneer work in film music. The film was a huge hit and went on to be screened in more than 40 countries in addition to Sweden. It was also the first ever Nordic feature-length film to have a full-length original score written for it. J�rnefelt's score was lost for a long time, although he did conduct a recording of extracts from the score in 1931. In the 1980s the original score was rediscovered among the possessions of J�rnefelt's relatives. J�rnefelt's score was augmented and restored by Jani Kyll�nen and Jaakko Kuusisto for the present recording.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=ODE%201328-2D&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Finland,"2019 Ondine Oy, Helsinki","2019 Ondine Oy, Helsinki",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For me, being in touch with mystic powers is the key to bringing out fully the groove and universality in contemporary music, as mystery transcends polarities, time, and physical dimensions. The title Raw Elegance came from my many years of fascination with and exploration of different combinations of polarities. Raw Elegance is one such polarity which was inherent in me but became more and more pronounced as I gradually found peace with the extremes in myself over the years, as part of my journey towards maturity. Raw Elegance sums up the general polarities in my personal style and taste on stage: I am a woman percussionist with a slim physique, yet by nature I perform with primitive power, intuition, and speed. Here, I present three timeless European contemporary works: Xenakis's 'Rebonds,' Billone's 'Mani.Matta,' and Odin's 'Maskine;' skin, wood, and metal. This album is a trilogy in itself.

During four visits to Lulea I have brought in new music and we have rehearsed, experimented, tried out and tested ideas, gotten to know each other. For me it has been a fantastic experience, a process that has enriched me in various ways as a composer and musician. Apart from having gained experience and learned various technical skills, the most surprising thing I discovered was that it could be a challenge to get the individual musician to take of the 'big band hat' which they usually take on when they sit down in a big band. While there is a use for these 'hats' or for 'standard big band musician practicies'; I find that in creative music, there is easily more room for more individual responsibility and approach. I have tried to make room for that, and it is my hope that a little bit of this shines through in the music we are presenting [on this album]. It is a constant goal for me to present my music as 'complete' and fully rounded in terms of idea, musical balance and presentation. Whether on album level or individual song level, I attempt to create a balanced composition with a sense of purpose that conveys an overall emotional message."","http://promo.naxos.se/623/Norrbotten_Big_Band/623/Norrbotten_Big_Band/_Iversen,_Anne_Mette_eng_Everything_in_between",https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=PCD188&medium=phy,02 Jazz,Jazz|Big Band,Jazz|Contemporary Jazz,Sweden,2018 Prophone Records,2018 Prophone Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I decided to call the set Unpainted Portraits, my aim being to paint musical portraits of people and prospects past, present and future. Literature, and especially poetry, has always been a source of inspiration for me in my work, and many of my new portraits are dedicated to writers I admire: the early 20th-century English modernist Virginia Woolf, the Finnish visionary playwright Minna Canth, and the contemporary S�mi poetess Rauni Magga Lukkari now living in Troms�, Norway. One of the pieces pays tribute and is dedicated to the Suffragettes campaigning for votes for women in early 20th-century England.

Originally released on Dinemec Classics, the Gershwin Centennial Edition features the composer's nephew and Frances' son, pianist Leopold Godowsky III, and the Royal Scottish National Orchestra conducted by Jos� Serebrier.

Composed as an extended ballet sequence for the 1951 MGM musical starring Gene Kelly, An American in Paris is a buoyant, Technicolor-bright tribute to the French capital shot through with jazz-accented vitality. The Concerto in F is a bold, brassy, brilliantly orchestrated work with a grandstanding piano line bridging the worlds of classical music and jazz. Its animated opening movement is followed by a Blues-tinged Adagio and a finale boasting a helter-skelter orgy of rhythm and athletic pianism. Initially reluctant to orchestrate Lullaby, Serebrier says: "Now I am glad Leopold persuaded me. I have tried to keep the scoring as simple and pure as possible, so that the orchestral version of this poignantly lovely piece might take on a life of its own in a voice that is still recognizably Gershwin's". The never before re-issued is a brilliant reminder of one of the most remarkable talents of the 20th century in performances by one of his greatest interpreters.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=ARIADNE%205003&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,EU,2018 SOMM Recordings,2018 SOMM Recordings,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The landmark six-volume series launches with two early Sonatas - Nos.2 (K280) and 6 (K284) - and a later masterpiece - No.17 (K570), the first composed when Mozart was 18 in 1774, the last, described by Alfred Einstein as "the ideal" of the composer's sonatas, in 1789 at the age of 33. Mozart's 19 Piano Sonatas, as music critic Christopher Morley comments in his booklet notes, "cover so much of his short life... and a huge range of styles and genres, from quasi-concertos without orchestra to simple study pieces... There are generic dance-movements, there are movements of exquisite contemplation, there are explorations of searching counterpoint, there are the most exquisite melodies, and there is the perfume of opera". The sonatas in this first volume include the early, harpsichord-accented Second in F major (K280), the dignified ceremonial of the Du�rnitz Sonata, No.6 in D major (K284) and the Sonata No.17 in B-flat major (K570), a work whose surface brilliance disguises its inner complexity. The impressive and sombre Fantasia No.3 in D minor (K397) completes the release. Described by BBC Radio 3 as "one of our greatest home-grown performers", Peter Donohoe's previous recordings for SOMM have attracted substantial critical approval and include the complete sonatas of Scriabin and Prokofiev along with works by Stravinsky. His recent partnering with Valerie Tryon and Mishka Rushdie Momen in Mozart's solo, duo and trio Mozart concertos prompted Gramophone to remark "it's good to be reminded just how much fun Mozart's works involving multiple pianos are".",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=SOMMCD%200191&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,EU,2018 SOMM Recordings,2018 SOMM Recordings,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The group's second release for SOMM follows 2016's well-received coupling of Schubert and Crusell, when MusicWeb International noted: "With an hour and a quarter of delightful music in first-rate performances, this album is a winner". Composed in 1800, Beethoven's Septet is one of the cornerstones of the chamber repertoire. Caught on the cusp between the Classical era and fast-emerging Romanticism, as Robert Matthew-Walker's booklet essay notes, "it abounds in felicitous light fancy and delicious invention... standing apart as a work of unquestionable independence of expression, already looking towards the initial decades of the new century". The Septet was the first work to pair clarinet, horn, bassoon, violin, viola, cello and double bass, its six movements "filled with sunny gaiety" (Matthew-Walker again) and realized here with exquisite delicacy and definition by Johnson in the company of the Carducci String Quartet, Peter Francombe (horn), Philip Gibbon (bassoon) and Christ West (double bass). For clarinet and string quartet, the Introduction, Theme and Variations, originally thought to have been Carl Maria Weber's but now ascribed to Joseph Kuffner, boasts an "inherent musicality and the beauty and cut of its themes and their treatment demonstrate quite clearly that this beautiful piece is well worth the attention of all lovers of music from the early Romantic period". Two delightfully playful and poetic arrangements by Emma Johnson of Johann Strauss II's Fruhlingsstimmen and Perpetuum Mobile provide surprising encores to a recording of chamber music at its most elegant and eloquent.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=SOMMCD%200190&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,EU,2018 SOMM Recordings,2018 SOMM Recordings,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As editor of the society's magazine, he published his own poems in the spirit of the time and also his music settings of his poetry. Geijer showed a great talent for music early on. Although he seems to have considered a career in music, it remained for him simply an activity for spare time. His mind was for chamber music and the smaller format, as well as songs. In 1816 his first piano trio was composed and in 1822 the first two string quartets in F Minor and B flat Major, and during the rest of the decade, among other things, a piano quintet, a piano quartet and two violin Sonatas. Randel was a Swedish musician and composer. As concertmaster at the Royal Opera Orchestra he arranged and composed music for some 20 plays. Especially famous is his composition and arrangement of F A Dahlgren's play V�rml�nningarna (1846), which for many years was a beloved and recurrent feature of the repertoire of the Stockholm Opera. He also composed four violin concertos, overtures and chamber works. The violin concertos are written in a French virtuoso style while the chamber music is influenced by the late style of Haydn and the early of Beethoven. Among the chamber works there are three string quartets and several solo pieces for violin.

But such was not the case in November 1950, when Charlie Parker's arrival in Sweden literally took some fans by surprise. The trip was made on such short notice that booking negotiations virtually continued until his day of departure from the States. Rumors of impending visits from Parker had circulated from time to time, but so exciting was the prospect that one dared not believe them. Given the scarecity of live jazz in Europe at that time, and the fact that Charlie Parker, the Messiah of modern jazz, was already achieving legendary status, it was preordained that this visit would be a particularly memorable one. We hope this live album proves to be as exciting to listeners now as it was to the approximately one thousand people who crowded into the dance hall of Folkets Park in Halsingborg and the seventy-five who were lucky enough to attend the session that followed all those years ago.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=SVL6017006&medium=phy,02 Jazz,Jazz|Bebop,Jazz|Mainstream Jazz,,2018 Storyville Records,2018 Storyville Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is a highly demanding work, not only due to its keyboard acrobatics but also because of its broad-ranging timbres. It is clear Castiglioni possessed an acute sensitivity for the instrument's qualities which he developed during his studies in Salzburg under Gulda and Zecchi. His was a conscious yet primarily "natural" pianism, in a Chopinesque sense, endowed with precious distillations of timbre that are no longer mere ornament but a surprising and mysterious creative element. This development was to extend to Debussy; the late Debussy would not have eluded Castiglioni's prehensile hands when he was attracted to the spell of Webern's labyrinths.

The latter has often accompanied their wish that everything should change. We know that when we want everything to change, we evoke fire. Flame, Bachelard writes in an essay, is of all the objects that evoke reverie, one of the greatest operators of images: flame forces us to imagine. This is a truth that Fausto Romitelli knew well. Referring precisely to the synthetic work Natura morta con fiamme (1991), for string quartet and electronics, he explicitly refers to an imaginary scale, to an extremity which has a language without words, purely of relations, of which the essential elements are conventional and abstract, implemented by algebraic and combinatory processes. Dedicated to the memory of Fausto Romitelli, the piece by Mauro Lanza, The 1987 Max Headroom Broadcast Incident (2017), for "augmented" string quartet, reflects precisely on what lies beyond what we always see - on the eye forced to watch and the ear forced to listen - we could almost say on the reverie that admires interference. Andrea Agostini conceived Legno, sabbia, vetro, cenere (2009-10), for quartet and electronics. The composer formed the idea of using additive and deferred synthesis- a technique that the composer is pleased to describe as "very old" - to pursue an ideal he never then abandoned. This was writing electronics with a degree of control over detail and articulation of sound that aspires, one could say, to a very marked musical determinism. Silvia Borzelli searches for a profound explanation with Earwitness (familiar 2) (2017), for string quartet and stereo soundtracks. The earwitness of the title is the person described by Elias Canetti in that strange collection of stories that take their name exactly from the story of that name.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=STR37105&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Contemporary Era,Italy,Milano Dischi,Milano Dischi,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The field of recording has indeed proved to be the most effective channel for expressing uncompromising ideas, an ideal context for an unadulterated presentation of my artistic personality regardless of any external influence. For this reason, the choice of the repertoire (although clearly based on the stylistic juxtaposition of the two major personalities of the Romantic guitar, Johann Kaspar Mertz and Giulio Regondi) was made through finding a strong emotional affinity which expresses an intimately artistic and personal link between myself and the works chosen, than following a mere philological approach in the rendering of the music of the past. While recognizing the immense value of the philological contribution which nineteenth-century guitar music has, these recordings attempt to free themselves from accademicism (although there is an aware and a grateful debt) and explore the relationship between the guitarist of the present and the sensitivity of then past, attempting to portray an identification of the performer with the music that he is to perform."",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=STR37112&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Guitar,Italy,Milano Dischi,Milano Dischi,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The surprisingly innovative expressiveness of this composition - which, for me at the time, included many new techniques - was a veritable shock and discovery. I remember leaving the first rehearsal with a real enthusiasm and the feeling of having discovered a world that would leave its indelible mark on my life. At the conservatoire in the 1970s, our analytical studies hadn't even touched upon microtonality - indeed, tonality ruled supreme and Boulez, for instance, certainly wasn't studied.

Thus a four-part dialogue began to take shape. The part of the fragment that was not yet in the score has now been transcribed from those plots. The project envisaged the four instruments placed in a cross and the listening area in the center of the acoustic space.

By narrating the political and cultural history of this region, the chapel masters make up an important, although less known musical heritage, which took place outside of the major musical centres in Italy. The Chapel of the Holy House of Loreto (forthwith Loreto Chapel) played a major part in this development and, because of this, became the main reference point during the production of this recording. This cd presents unpublished compositions, which are kept in the archives of Loreto and Macerata, by authors who held office as chapel masters of the Holy House in the period between 1740 and 1866. Excluding perhaps Zingarelli, none of these composers are known outside the context of sacred music, and if so, they are known only locally. Their musical formation was, essentially, related to the Roman and Neapolitan schools and the likes of Fedele Fenaroli, Alessandro Speranza, Giuseppe Jannacconi; musicians whose didactic activity contributed a great deal to the success of many composers of the late eighteenth century, as creators of an outstanding vocal model. In describing the musical landscape in which this florilegium of small sacred creations was realized, one cannot ignore the refined compositional work of the Neapolitan Giuseppe Giordani (1751-1798), known as Giordaniello, the chapel master of the Fermo Cathedral from 1789 until his death, who was the author, amongst other things, of about one hundred compositions, from offertories to lamentations, for one or more voices and organo concertato.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=TC800009&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Sacred,Austria,2018 TACTUS RECORDS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Intense songs, a girlish-fresh, innocent-sounding voice, the concise flute playing of the bandleader and a compelling, swinging groove: these are the outstanding features of this evocative, drumless quartet. It is the well-honed rhythm section made up by Thomas Baumgartner and Marco Nenniger that provides the ideal foundation on top of which voice and flute confidently layer their melody lines. Whether the pianist is establishing the base color or placing accents in his solos, or the bass player is providing the grounding for a ballad or getting into the groove with a counter-melody, Scott LaFaro-style: this duo seems joined at the hip. The experience of both Baumgartner and Nenniger extends beyond jazz projects, and at times they enter into a dialogue with voice and flute while at others they hold themselves back or even fall silent to provide space for the other two.

The Clarinet Sextet and The Shed Dances are immediately appealing in their melodiousness and harmonic language, whereas the darkly aggressive String Trio No. 1 foreshadows the Third Symphony with its stark juxtaposition of contrasts, and An Outstretched Hand offers a disturbing comment on our troubled 21st century condition.

The Ernst Krenek Ensemble is joined here by three of the finest lieder singers currently active, Laura Aikin, Bernarda Fink, and Florian Boesch. The Ernst Krenek Ensemble has set itself the task of introducing Ernst Krenek's important and extensive chamber music oeuvre to the programmes of international concert halls, although its repertoire also includes works by composers such as Schubert and Beethoven, who provided Krenek with important stimulus.

Associating these two Romantic geniuses, bound by a unique friendship, in one edition enables a new viewpoint. It immediately becomes apparent that the two last symphonies of Brahms and Dvorak have more than their key in common- yet this also illuminates their differences. The encounter with these masterpieces becomes a sensual and intellectual adventure, sparking enthusiasm, amazement, and joy. Both the Bamberger Symphoniker's concert programmes and their discography have long been marked by openness and a readiness to take risks, as displayed for example in their pioneering Mahler cycle, or the complete recordings of Schubert symphonies alongside works by Berio, Rihm, Widmann, and other contemporary composers.

Embedded in a tense relationship of insatiable curiosity and compositional skill, Korsun develops literally unheard musical worlds. "Often she takes a single theme, idea or vision and pursues it into depths so profound as to become existential. Viewed from this vantage point, we can descry the defining features of her personal style: heedless of tradition, she seeks and finds the resources she needs for each particular project. Her sonic imagination knows practically no bounds", as described by Ingo Dorfm�ller.

From Fran�ois Couperin to Robert Schumann and Claude Debussy to Bernd Alois Zimmermann and Karlheinz Stockhausen. What matters to Posadas in his cycle is not to make explicit connections to the past; he rather discerns concepts from the historical repertoire, namely Erinnerungsspuren [memory traces], that find expression in pianistic experiments. Special playing techniques with the pedals, with preparations and inside the piano allow changes of individual sounds and micro-intervals while they are resounding, thus creating a trans-historical sound space. In his cycle Alberto Posadas gives less answers than he raises questions in which the music of his six predecessors can be heard as sounds of remembrance: How can new and old material put each other in a different light and perhaps even redefine themselves?
