Songs of Lake Volta features nine traditional Ghanian songs surrounded by original music composed by Sheehan, performed by two critically acclaimed groups: Kinetic and Kassia Ensemble. Sheehan returned to Ghana several times after a life-changing trip in 2008, between 2013 and 2017, to further explore the country and its music. The intensity of these studies, which included many unforgettable late nights drumming and dancing, continued to inspire him, resulting in Kinetic's 2014 recording, World of Wonder, and now in Songs of Lake Volta. To promote the values of open, critical cross-cultural dialogue, this genre-bending album challenges the persistent notion of drumming being the sole outstanding feature of traditional African music. Kinetic, which Sheehan founded, is comprised of five versatile musicians who believe in breaking down barriers between traditional music genres and audiences. The newly-formed Kassia Ensemble is equally focused on breaking down barriers – the all-woman group came together to supersede the gender barrier that is prevalent in classical music. Songs of Lake Volta features vocalist Anqwenique Wingfield singing in various indigenous languages and styles representative of Ghana's ethnic diversity. The amalgamation of the Kassia Ensemble's and Kinetic's musicians represents an equally diverse spirit, incorporating whose work outside these groups extends to contemporary classical, R&B and hip-hop. Songs of Lake Volta expresses Sheehan's joy and admiration for Ghanian music in an honest and respectful way, sharing a wisdom that unites the three music traditions from which it draws influence: West African, classical and jazz.",https://youtu.be/08hKIi5mTVU,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=AR0009&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Modern Era,,2018 Ansonica Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Halír himself played regularly in a piano trio, so it is only fitting that the ensemble aiming to revive his legacy plays in such a formation.

How to hear, other than through the soul, the light and fluid illumination that transcends her playing, how to feel this delicate but deep breath, combined with exquisite delicacy and absolute intensity, other than by watching a child play and enter its universe. You could say that the art of Marina is self-evident. But that would be to forget early and constant hard work throughout her life, first with the Russian masters in St. Petersburg, then in Moscow, passing through Prague where she taught piano, while being part of the international scene. Her repertoire, varied and original, includes the great composers but also the more obscure. She loves to discover hidden treasures as well as the spark in others and in herself. This allows us to hear a piano that is vibrant with emotion and authenticity, with an incandescent pulse at her fingertips, letting us hear miraculously the very heart and soul that makes Marina Samson-Primachenko a pure artist.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=UP0205&medium=phydig,01 Classical,Classical,,Czech Republic,2018 Arco Diva,2018 Arco Diva,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its aim is not to provide answers, but to reawaken our love of the question and of the act of questioning itself. Fittingly, this exploration takes the form of improvisation. Each improvisation is a creative act, bound to time, giving an answer only in the present moment and changing in the next. Improvisation creates possibility, openness, expansiveness, dialogue, development, connection – all preconditions for asking questions without a predetermined answer. And the shifting between the sound worlds of jazz and tradition also reflects the search for the universal, for shared origins and, one could also say, for the essence of music. With Hansjörg Fink and Elmar Lehnen, two remarkable talents devote themselves to this search, each a virtuoso on his respective instrument and together a versatile and experienced duo willing to try new things and sound out the limits of what is instrumentally possible.

Dance is passion and pure lust for life. Celebrations call for dancing. That was as true in the palaces and the taverns of the 18th century as it is today in the techno temples of the new era. This is the surging river that ECHO-Klassik winners Spark have set out to bridge in their project 'On the Dancefloor.' The Classical Band throws an arch from the spirited ballet music of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart to the chamber techno penned by contemporary composer Sebastian Bartmann, finding that two seemingly contrasting worlds actually fit very well together.   The question is: what can a gavotte of 1778 and a techno piece of 2017 learn from one another? In the view of Spark, the Classical Band, quite a lot. Mozart in his day knew how to build wildly throbbing structures so as to create this trance-like state that today's dance-mad club-goers still live for. On the other hand there is scarcely a techno piece that does without baroque or classical figurations. This sets in motion a stimulating, lively dialogue between yesterday and today, between the ultimate Classical maestro and the trend-setters of the contemporary composing circuit. The two centuries and more that separate Mozart from Bartmann and his contemporaries are brilliantly illuminated by Spark. The musicians have consciously chosen to keep jumping back and forth between these worlds, sparking direct connections between them. So you sense intimately how timeless dance is and how similar are the emotions aroused by the dances of quite different times and genres. There is always this boundless delight in going wild to music, feeling utterly alive and letting the rhythms stream through your body – complete surrender, total immersion in the intoxicating whirl of sound. That is just what Spark would wish for all listeners to this album: nights of wild dancing through all the ages of music!",https://youtu.be/63ruogsM0zE,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=0301069BC&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Classical Crossover,Germany,2018 Edel Germany GmbH,2018 Edel Germany GmbH,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It rings true: German Brass represents the hallmark of the highest quality brass music made in Germany – or as Concerti magazine put it: ""Trailblazers of the Brass scene"". The ensemble's last album was all about pre-Christmas anticipation, joyful messages and everything that revolves round Bach, Telemann and Handel. Brass Hommage takes us to the opposite end of the calendar spectrum. Things are colorful, rhythmic, exotic even. After a bombastic introduction by way of Strauss's Thus spake Zarathustra it's off to the south and the west, armed with a sun hat and shades with classics ranging from Black Bottom Stomp, via Quien Sera, As Time Goes By, Tico Tico to Oye Como va. This is the perfect programme for hot days and balmy nights. With their virtuosity, their brilliant musicality and their own special charm, they have definitely placed their stamp/made their mark on brass culture. Their declared goal is to reproduce the grand-scale resonant sound of an organ.  That's what inspires German Brass's arrangers and members to produce that sound which has given this top-flight ensemble an inimitable edge for decades. They have been making German brass history now for more than 40 years. Founded in 1974, they seem not to have grown a day older since then. Proof of that can be seen in their full concert schedule. The fact that the ensemble recruits musicians from Germany's top orchestras means that they can offer outstanding quality, and their collaboration over decades still has audiences gasping, wide-eyed and perking up their ears to hear this musical cornucopia.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=0301067BC&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Brass & Woodwinds,Germany,2018 Edel Germany GmbH,2018 Edel Germany GmbH,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Stenhammar the conductor and pianist was a leading figure in the musical life of Sweden and Scandinavia, but in his role as composer he struggled with self-doubt, feeling that his knowledge of musical theory was insufficient. In 1910 he decided to address this perceived shortcoming, and began an intensive study of counterpoint which included setting himself several thousand assignments over the following decade. At the same time, between 1911 and 1915, Stenhammar composed his G minor symphony, and against this background it is hardly surprising that it displays his preoccupation with counterpoint, its final movement a grandiose double fugue. If the symphony is one of Stenhammar's most celebrated works, his music for Strindberg's A Dream Play is one of the least-known. It was composed for a production of Strindberg's existential drama in 1916, a year after the completion of the Symphony. Rarely performed after that, the music was arranged into a concert version in 1970 by Hilding Rosenberg. Christian Lindberg and the Antwerp Symphony Orchestra have previously recorded Stenhammar's Serenade to critical acclaim.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=BIS-2329&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Orchestral,EU,2018 BIS Records,2018 BIS Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Possibly it was the high regard in which he held the genre that for so long stopped him from actually completing a quartet of his own – although he had first seriously considered writing one in 1828, it took almost 15 years before he was ready to fully commit to the idea. Once he had done so, there was no returning: during some hectic summer weeks in 1842, a year which is often called 'Schumann's chamber music year', he completed the three string quartets of his Op. 41, presenting them to his wife Clara on her 23rd birthday in September. In her diary she wrote '… they delighted me to the utmost. Everything in them is new, clear, expertly worked out and always idiomatic.' The Op.41 quartets were to be the only ones from Schumann's pen, but this is not to suggest that he was dissatisfied with them: in 1847 he wrote to his publisher that he regarded the quartets 'as my best work from earlier times'. They are here performed by the Norwegian Engegård Quartet, whose latest release on BIS, of quartets by Grieg and Sibelius, has received critical acclaim, for instance in Gramophone: 'Those seeking the Grieg/Sibelius pairing in modern sound would be hard pressed to find better.'",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=BIS-2361&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Chamber Music,EU,2018 BIS Records,2018 BIS Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He often said that if he hadn't become a director he would have wished to become a conductor, and went so far as to claim that 'film and music are almost the same thing. They are means of expression and communication that go beyond human wisdom and that touch a person's emotional centre.' Bergman's interest in classical music became evident early on in his career. Music in Darkness (1948) is about a pianist who loses his sight in a shooting accident. To Joy (1950) features a violinist who dreams of a solo career and Summer Interlude (1951) takes place at the Royal Swedish Opera. He admired all who could perform music, reserving his greatest love for pianists, and concert pianists are portrayed in Hour of the Wolf, Face to Face and Autumn Sonata.  One of Bergman's favourite Swedish pianists was Roland Pöntinen, who here performs a number of pieces featured in Bergman's films, by composers including Mozart, Chopin and Schumann. Pöntinen is joined by the Stenhammar Quartet in the second movement of Schumann's piano quintet, used by Bergman to great effect in the award-winning Fanny and Alexander.

With good reason: the huge work and its highly systematic structure demonstrate with utmost clarity Bach's immense skill as a composer. Books and treatises have been written to analyse how it is constructed, amazing both musicologists and mathematicians. But as the Danish accordionist Andreas Borregaard writes in his own liner notes to this disc: 'the Goldberg Variations are so much more than a gigantic, sounding sudoku. Each variation is an expressive universe unto itself, and the music passes through almost every corner of the human spectrum of emotions.' Originally written for the harpsichord, the work has become part of the piano repertoire, but the emotional range that Borregaard emphasizes is perhaps brought out even more clearly when it is performed, as here, on the accordion. The inherent nostalgia of the Aria is more poignant than ever, the gigue in Variation 7 has the swagger of sailors on shore leave, and the introspection of Variation 15 is almost hypnotic.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=BIS-2399&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Baroque Era,EU,2018 BIS Records,2018 BIS Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast to his far shorter Sixth Symphony, also in C major, it was named ""the Great"" - and it is indeed a great and magnificent work, marking the culmination of his symphonic oeuvre. It is monumental and representative, and was written with large audiences very much in mind. Schubert began this composition in August 1824, or possibly even as late as March 1825. Most of the work on it took place in the summer of 1825, during the longest Journey of his life. It took him from Vienna via Linz, Steyr, Gmunden (where he found the scenery ""truly heavenly""), Salzburg and then up to Bad Gastein, where he saw some magnificent alpine peaks. The first page of the score manuscript is dated ""March 1828"" – possibly the month in which he finally completed the work. On November 19 of that same year, Schubert died at the age of only thirty-one. The symphony was premiered posthumously on March 21, 1839 in the Leipzig Gewandhaus, and conducted by the Gewandhaus Kapellmeister at that time - the 30-year-old Felix Mendelssohn.

He then moved to Moscow and studied at the Moscow State Conservatory, graduating in 1978. He continued his studies, completing a postgraduate degree in composition in 1980, studying with Professor Mikhail Chulaki. While still a student, he received a special prize from the Soviet Union of Composers for his work 'Dramatic Triptych.' Zhukov is an eclectic composer, having produced a large catalogue of chamber, choral, orchestral, and theatrical works. He has placed particular emphasis on the genre of the concerto. Zhukov composed three concertos for piano, violin, and cello, which he dedicated to each of the Khazak Nakipbekova sisters (The Bekova Trio). This series of concertos earned him the Music Review award of 'Composer of the Year' in 2002. When he composed 'Silentium,' Zhukov had in his mind not only Eleonora Bekova's skills as a soloist but also her psychological profile. The theme of the concerto is the special relationship between sound and silence. The Violin Concerto 'Angel's Day' was designed to fit the character of violinist Elvira Bekova using her remarkable capacity to perform exactly according to the composer's intention. It also reflects the theatrical style of the composer.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=CC9105&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Orchestral,United Kingdom,2018 Lyrita Recorded Edition,2018 Lyrita Recorded Edition,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Baker's uncle once told him, ""If your Snark be a Boojum!... You will softly and suddenly vanish away, and never be met with again!"" Through this journey relationships develop, tensions rise and the Baker's worst nightmare comes true. The Hunting of the Snark shares its fictional setting with Lewis Carroll's earlier poem ""Jabberwocky"" published in his children's novel Through the Looking Glass (1871). Eight nonsense words from ""Jabberwocky"" appear in The Hunting of the Snark: bandersnatch, beamish, frumious, galumphing, jubjub, mimsiest, outgrabe and uffish. In a letter to the mother of his young friend Gertrude Chataway, Carroll described the domain of the Snark as ""an island frequented by the Jubjub and the Bandersnatch- no doubt the very island where the Jabberwock was slain."" Douglas Young (b. 1947) won the competition scholarship to the Royal College of Music, London and the Karl Rankl Prize for orchestral composition. He has written several scores for the Royal ballet, and in the 90's widened his scope to encompass jazz, popular dance music, film scores, and advertising jingles.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=CC9106&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical,United Kingdom,2018 Lyrita Recorded Edition,2018 Lyrita Recorded Edition,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Poeme is an excellent example of the fact that for Blacher, who wrote a large number of 'genuine' ballets, movement plays a central role even in works that are to be understood as absolute music. It sounds almost a little strange that such an individualist and musician open-minded to absolute innovation had no direct problems with the conditions imposed by Nazi cultural policy also on the whole field of music, but quite the opposite, was in a position at that time to compose some of his major works. .

While the original Italian version underlined his position as one of the leading opera composers of the time, the German version which he wrote a year later additionally emphasizes his position as a pioneer of the German National Opera.

One line of notes is enough to build - together with the king theme - a whole piece of 2, 3 or 4 voices. The mathematical strength of this task and the timeless beautiful solution by J. S. Bach fascinates until today. The German composer Sebastian Gottschick arranged the pieces, added pizzicati to the slow movement of the trio sonata, he created two new pieces with the material of Bach and combined the pieces to a contemporary concert. Ariadne Daskalakis and her Ensemble Vintage Cologne present the modern concert version by Sebastian Gottschick as well as the missing original versions by Bach.

It seem both books, composed two decades apart, were written primarily for educative personal and private use in the home – probably to be played on the intimate clavichord. One of the most famous works written for the keyboard, The Well-Tempered Clavier is simply enjoyable music of the highest craftsmanship. Alexandra Papstefanou graduated from Athens Conservatoire, where she studied piano under Aliki Vatikioti. She followed her studies with Olga Zhukova at the Moscow Tchaikovsky Conservatory, with Peter Solymos, at the Franz Liszt Academy of Music in Budapest and, on a scholarship from the Alexander Onassis Foundation, at the University of Indiana in Bloomington, USA, with the highly influential teacher György Sebok. She has also taken lessons from Alfred Brendel. Papastefanou was a finalist at the Clara Haskil Competition in Switzerland and received the Liebstoeckl and Fazioli Prizes at the International Geneva Competition, as well as the Spyros Motsenigos Prize from the Academy of Athens. She has performed all of Bach's keyboard works and, in a series of recitals, has presented his complete Well-Tempered Clavier, Goldberg Variations, The Art of Fugue, and The Musical Offering as well as his keyboard concertos.",https://youtu.be/1j0iilL2Vcs,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=FHR65&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,United Kingdom,2018 First Hand Records,2018 First Hand Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

So, just as a few pencil strokes outlining the architectural design of a magnificent building may give a more vivid impression than the final realisation of the design, the compositions from the study book may seem more vivid to us than the great symphony. They are a world unto themselves. Bruckner's piano works (the compositions and sketches from the study book and the published works) occupy, at best, a marginal position in the eyes of the concert world, performers, listeners and organisers. Their rich substance is yet to be duly acknowledged, for these small-scale works are the fascinating building-blocks of great music.

Everything pointed to an exponential increase in those studies with the arrival of the 21st century, but it was not the case. Once the first years of the new millennium were over, in which the studies by Gerardo Arriaga, Lola Josa and a few others were published, the research drastically decreased. This album aims to rekindle that preservation. The works here are sung pieces, in verse and vernacular language, known in that period as human tones (or just tones) when they were profane, and divine tones when they were religious. Those composed in the first half of the 17th century were mostly polyphonic, which reveals that, in this period, polyphony was still thought to be highest. The Book of Human Tones, preserved at present at the National Library of Spain under the signature M 1262, constitutes, with its 222 works, a privileged sample of all the aspects. Who might be interested in these works has now the possibility to listen to them in a retrained performance on four voices with harp accompaniment, one of the instruments used in this repertoire. If, on the one hand, the vocal quartet shows that the ""grace notes"" (""quiebros"") and voice effects do not constitute an impediment for the care of tuning, on the other hand the harp adds to the score beautiful introductory and transition passages based on the features of passacaglias and 17th century dances.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=IBS-102018&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Spain,2018 IBS Artist,2018 IBS Artist,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

His artistic career of more than 60 years was a whole era in Russian and world performing art of the 20th century. Shafran was one of the first Soviet cellists to turn to Bach's music. However, the outstanding cellist's ""way to Bach"" was long and complicated. According to Shafran, he used to treat Bach's cello suites as ""instructive"" music, but the recordings of Pablo Casals, who he met after the war, overthrew his idea of the cello Bach. Even after that Shafran had just some of the pieces or their parts in his repertoire and finally performed and recorded Bach's sonatas for cello and piano with composer Andrei Volkonsky.

Quasi-tonal but modern, traditional but minimalist, the German composer has created an opera uniting two historical protagonists as multi-faceted as the music itself.  The libretto, written by Steffens' son Marec Béla Steffens, fancifully merges the lives of Brother Gabriel Téllez, best known under his pen name Tirso de Molina as the inventor of the fictional womanizer Don Juan, and that of Miguel de Cervantes, the author of windmill-fighting Don Quixote. Both look upon the world from their own respective confines – the monk Brother Gabriel from his cloister, Don Miguel from a debtor's prison cell. Their divine literary outbursts are provoked by a very mundane desire indeed: Both habitats share the same slothful cook, a lady with a penchant for gallant novels. Spurred by the same simple wish of enjoying a heartier fare, both Brother Gabriel and Don Miguel de Cervantes embark on a competition to come up with the raciest, most exciting novel to win the good will of their cook.  The music captures this dialectic perfectly, conveying a grandiose arc of drama with deceptive ease and at the same time elevating the mundane to greatness. It would be tempting to diagnose enlightened undertones in the libretto as well as in the music: For as sublime as the work sounds, it remains deeply committed to the human spirit.  Two Cells in Sevilla is rounded off by Steffens' musical interpretation of five poems by fellow-German Friedrich Hölderlin, widely known for the intensely lyrical, idealistic quality of his work and his tragic descent into insanity. With these lieder's ethereal fluctuation between beauty and pain, they truly are an apt choice for an album as full of contrasts as this one.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNWSgFnW_fQ&feature=youtu.be,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=NV6174&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Opera,,,2018 Navona Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The result is an original creation that is unapologetically post-modern, yet deeply rooted in Chinese traditionalism.  The instrumentation itself already offers ample proof for this unique blend. ""Ding"", scored for double bass and the Chinese zither guzheng, reflects the nine ancient rulers of the Zhou kingdom in just as many short musical sections.  ""Whispering Fragrance,"" an intuitive, ethereal composition for solo violin, aims to capture the transcendent sensual experiences of interacting with nature – sight, smell, hearing – with the instrument's natural harmonics.  Stephen Yip, who nowadays lives in the United States, does not shy away from jazz instrumentation, either. ""In 7th Heaven,"" a saxophone, double bass and piano seek to create a state of debonair tranquility.  Nevertheless, the influence of Yip's Chinese heritage remains profoundly interwoven with his musical creations. Some of the different meanings of the Chinese word ""Ran"" are set to sound in the eponymous piece written for solo guzheng, running the gamut from collected composure to fiery agitation. ""Tranquility in Consonance"", set for flute, saxophone, bassoon and piano, never loses its distinctly Eastern feel, which is partially due to applying playing techniques of Chinese instruments to the Western set-up, partially due to its uninhibited celebration of environmental and natural sounds.  Finally, ""Peace of Mind"" is an atmospheric development of heterogeneous textures, the conclusion of which mirrors the title.

Works by Tchaikovsky, Cassado, Rudnytsky, and Rimsky-Korsakov are presented by the dynamic and versatile cellist Nada Radulovich with Cullum Bryant, one of the most active chamber and collaborative pianists in New York City. Tchaikovsky composed Six French Songs, opus 65', to the original French text by three French poets. Although this is a fully instrumental program, Radulovich provides the first English translation of these songs sonata. The four movements of Cassadó, written by composer and cellist Gaspar Cassado (1897-1966), represent various moods and dances. At times poignant, dramatic, playful, or uplifting, this compelling work, recorded here for the first time, is an effective synthesis of tradition cast in striking, harmonic terms. Romantic Fantasie for Cello and Piano, Op 43, by Ukrainian composer Antin Rudnytsky (1902-1975), displays a conservative 20th-century harmonic language, while exploring the folk idioms of the composer's native land. The intricate dialogue between the instruments illustrates the composer's skill at evoking a variety of moods within a single composition.  One of Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov's best-known works, Flight of the Bumblebee, evokes the erratic path of the tiny insect.

With its cadenzas and dazzling virtuoso display, the Sonata Op. 33, No. 3 has the expressive range of a piano concerto, including an aria-like Adagio worthy of Mozart's Vienna. Clementi was noted for his technical brilliance with runs in thirds, a hallmark found in the Op. 25 sonata alongside surprisingly operatic pauses, and a captivatingly lucid style of writing that always sounds freshly minted. Stefan Chaplikov made his concert debut in Sofia at the age of eleven.

The album is elegantly cohesive across the entire program, as concerns with alternate intonation systems, experimental approaches to timbre, and intensely collaborative work connect the pieces.

One hears this immediately in the first bars of the opening work by longtime Wet Ink Ensemble colleague, Sam Pluta. We hear not just a generic violin scraping sound along the string, instead we hear a whole vocabulary opening up inside this technique of sound production, a language Modney manipulates with as much subtlety of expression as we hear in his just-intoned performance of Bach's timeless Ciaconna. Josh Modney's improvisations demonstrate the sophisticated vocabulary he has developed for his work in this context.

The works on his latest collection, ""Uncanny Affable Machines,"" are all engaged, in one form or another, with the paradigm of human/machine interaction. Firmly within a polemical tradition related to electro-acoustic composition, Moe engages with the complex dynamics suggested by a performance involving a live human and a prerecorded track. Many of the sounds on the playback are ""organic"" themselves, however, involving manipulated recordings of human performers, or recorded sounds from the environment. And of course, in order to coordinate with the playback, a live performer needs to discipline themselves to execute the passagework precisely with the tape each time, making themselves more machine-like. This is just one of the ways that the medium invites us into a fascinating dialogue blurring the lines between the technological and the human, and Moe is acutely aware of this in his approach.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=FCR212&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Contemporary Era,United States,Eric Moe,Eric Moe,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Her poetry pulsates with her love of Indian landscapes, seasons and flowers, simple joys, devotion and the splendor of Indian festivals. I chose an accompaniment of string quartet and clarinet to extend and enhance the richness of Naidu's imagery and the passion she evokes.

These five poems form a cycle of one Indian woman's experience of lost love, delight in a colourful procession, the thrill of new young love, contemplation of death, and ecstasy at the beauty of creation and the omnipresence of God. Her poetry pulsates with her love of Indian landscapes, seasons and flowers, simple joys, devotion and the splendor of Indian festivals. I chose an accompaniment of string quartet and clarinet to extend and enhance the richness of Naidu's imagery and the passion she evokes. The clarinet, like a second melodic voice, weaves around the vocal line, sometimes sensuous, sometimes raucous and abandoned, in imitation of the Indian double-reed instrument the shenai. Many of the songs have long introductions, interludes and postludes, where the writing becomes more symphonic than mere accompaniment.""

The violin soloist was Tamsin Waley-Cohen and the Czech Philharmonic was conducted by Ben Gernon. Niobe, daughter of Tantalus and wife of King Amphion of Thebes, gave birth to seven sons and seven daughters. At the annual celebration in honour of Leto, goddess of motherhood and protector of the young, Niobe boasts that she is greater than the goddess by virtue of the fact that Leto only has two children, Apollo and Artemis, whereas she has seven times as many. Leto, enraged, sends Apollo to kill all her sons, and Artemis to kill all her daughters. Her husband Amphion, devestated, kills himself.

Whereas some movements are inspired by a single picture, others are composites of many scenes or visual variations on a theme. In responding musically to Hokusai's genius for capturing the essence of an image I concentrated mainly on pictures that evoke movement and dynamism (II A Sudden Gust of Wind: III Waterfalls: VI A Wild Sea at Choshi). By contrast, the central movement A Friend Departing In Snow has a stillness that is only broken by the yearning for the departing friend. Thematically the set of seven miniatures are framed by the two outer movements devoted to the eternal fascination of Mount Fuji. The Fuji theme, like an idée fixe, recurs in the inner movements, especially in A Sudden Gust of Wind. Similarly, other themes such as the rising cello theme in II, appears in extended form in VI and the elegiac viola theme of III is developed as a principle countersubject to the Fuji theme in VII. Seven Hokusai Miniatures attempts musical explorations of Hokusai's flair for stylisation, humour, parody, the grotesque and calm. Although some movements incorporate formal musical structures (rondo, variation, hocket, canon, inversion) my hope is that they display a lightness of touch and freedom that is reflected in the incomparable mastery of image by the great Japanese master.""",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=NMP1053&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,United Kingdom,2017 Richard Blackford,2017 Richard Blackford,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Constructed in reverse sonata form the opening dotted theme is made up entirely of major and minor thirds, implying an F-sharp minor/F-sharp major tonality. A contrasting motif, repeated G-sharps, forms the second subject on top of the persistent dotted rhythm. In the development section the main theme is presented in canon and soon leads to a thundering version of the repeated G-sharps, now in pounding octave bass with heavy right hand syncopation. The principle theme begins a series of transformations, expanding its major/minor thirds to fourths, and fifths. After a short interlude marked Andante the ""pounding theme"" re-appears softly at first, heralding the recapitulation. A new motif in ""pushed"" jazz rhythm leads to an accelerando and extended re-statement of the ""pounding"" theme. The principle theme bursts through in the bass, then in full two part counterpoint before cascading downwards to an exuberant conclusion.""",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=NMP1062&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,United Kingdom,2017 Richard Blackford,2017 Richard Blackford,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There was once again heated discussion over the guiding principles governing the presentation of the festival – as reported, along with much else, in the well-informed and lively booklet note by Peter Emmerich. But Wieland confounded and convinced his critics with a rediscovery of his directorial idiom, described by him as ""magic realism."" Musical success was achieved on the grand scale by the brilliant exponents of Senta and the Dutchman- and by the musically modern slim-line conductor, who had made his Bayreuth debut not long before in the new production of Tristan. Leonie Rysanek, whose singing gave vivid meaning to all the drama's emotional aspects, also had the figure for the part- in her own words, she was the ""slimmest Senta in the world."" With his powerful voice and darkly glowing male timbre, the inimitably elegant and empathetic George London remains without peer on this recording as elsewhere. Just as convincingly cast in its other roles, the work soon established itself in this second ""New Bayreuth"" staging even in its spiritual home. We would make a special point of observing that this historic audio document was captured not at the premiere performance, but during a second live recording on August 5, 1959.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=C936182I&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Austria,"2018 Orfeo International Music GmbH, Poing","2018 Orfeo International Music GmbH, Poing",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is on that immensely fascinating association that this collection of arias is focused. The nineteen selections- composed by Mozart, Beethoven, Weber, Wagner, Meyerbeer, Berlioz, Gounod, Offenbach, Verdi, Boito, Mussorgsky, Stravinsky and Getty- take us on a journey through a period spanning some two hundred years, exploring how composers working in diverse national and institutional contexts and writing in an array of styles and genres exploited the bass voice to engage with the depiction of such characters.This colorful repertoire is sung by the esteemed American bass-baritone Kevin Short, whose powerful voice is as sensuous as it is sinister.

As the name implies, Anderson's solo compositions act as milestones to the artist's musical development through the intimacy of solo instruments.  As an instrumentalist early in his expansive career, Anderson found particular affection for live performance. In this album, you will hear the diversity of the composer's inspiration amid its intense, physical element. The first track, appropriately named ""...increasingly, physical…"", establishes tension with consistent building and release, creating captivating drama that draws the listener in immediately.     Various artists spanning the artistic timeline of Anderson's career perform on One At A Time. Each track spotlights a different instrument, adding to Anderson's compositional legacy.  ""...increasingly, physical…"" performed by Maureen Keenan, kicks off the album with her intense performance on the flute. The jazz-influenced composition is played with inescapable passion. Five Bagatelles and a Synopsis, on the other hand, is an exploration lead by pianist Jin-Ok Lee into a realm evoking free jazz sharing blurred lines with the avant-garde. Contrast that with ""...springing, gradually…"" which presents Debbie Schmidt and her French horn creating a grand orchestral sound that evokes nostalgia for the days of radio dramas.

Wittgraf is releasing his debut album Manifold, an expansive effort with numerous layers hidden in the composition. Choosing texture over melody, the visceral compositions of Manifold draw the listener in to the arresting music, and sound as if it would take lifetimes to unpack the complex layers building to Wittgraf's stellar debut.  The album features Jesse Langen on guitar, for whom Wittgraf wrote the eponymous track and Topographic Timepiece. The compositions rumble with complexity, some employing electronic sounds, others entirely acoustic. The truly expressive nature of Langen's performance leaves the listener impressed with the balance of such a calculated composition combined with his ability to build emotion.  Performing with Langen on two improvised tracks is vocalist Amanda DeBoer Bartlett, who adds to the chilling texture of the album with her modernist take on medieval chanting. DeBoer Bartlett brings a new variety to the music with her ability to elongate beautiful melodies only to, literally, hush herself and let the listener dissolve back into the eerie fog of Wittgraf's electronics and Langen's guitar. On tracks such as Improvisation 2 and Improvisation 4, the performers tenderly build the centrifugal force of the song with DeBoer Bartlett's processed voice providing a soothing drone. As the droning climaxes, the soundscape sends the listener spiraling into a haunting, brand new dimension of texture and space. Wittgraf's brilliance with computer manipulation makes the composition seem as though the listener has just phased into the sounds of an alternative universe.  Manifold was recorded at Experimental Sound Studio in Chicago, IL. Wittgraf holds the title of Chester Fritz Professor at the University of North Dakota.

Not only did Biver compose the five tracks on the album, she either performed on, produced, mixed and/or engineered many of them.  On the opening track, Mirror, which draws its inspiration from the poem ""Empress in the Mirror"" by the American poet Colette Inez, Biver begins her exploration into the very nature of identity. Girl, Walking continues that exploration, flowing through five sections that are shaped as they go along by improvisations of the parts of the bassist, flutist and guitarist. We Meet Ourselves is dedicated to fellow Fuse Ensemble member Scott Deal, whose solo marimba triggers audio samples which represent Jung's theories about the impact of confrontations with the unconscious and of the messages we receive as we go through life. On The Cellar Door, Biver musically explores Jung's theory of individuation, the process by which the psyche becomes integrated and whole. Perhaps the only piece on the album not deriving inspiration from psychological inquiry is the closing track, No Matter Where. Biver states that she interpreted ""No Matter Where, Not Pictured Here,"" a painting by the notable American artist Jackie Tileston, as a journey and so decided to sonically travel around it.

I tried to hide my tears trickling down the cheek in the last act. Usually it was very exciting to sit in the orchestra seats and keep up with everything that happened on stage. Everyone wore make-up and strange costumes, but as soon as Father began to sing, I recognized him. It was easy. He sounded 'different' than the rest of the ensemble. My Father was in his early 30s and had then been singing for 25 years. Already at the age of four to five, my Father and his brothers began to learn the essentials of the art of singing under my grandfather David's solid guidance. I have spent a great deal of my life exploring the secrets of the Italian bel canto, conveyed by David and my Father, and I have reached the conclusion that there are no secrets; it is just the natural voice that has to be heard, free from settings and so-called tone formation. There is only one problem; it takes time. Manipulation of the voice in different ways to achieve quick results is doomed to fail.

His work on scores, sound, orchestra size, seating, and playing style has had a profound effect on the way nineteenth century music is now perceived and, not surprisingly, he is in great demand by symphony orchestras worldwide.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=SWR19511CD&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Germany,2010 SWR Media Services GmbH,2018 Naxos Deutschland GmbH,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ferdinand Leitner conducts this towering masterpiece in its original form, free from speculative edits to the unfinished fourth movement. The noted German conductor, Ferdinand Leitner, studied at the Music School in his home city under Fritz Schreker and Julius Prüwer from 1926 to 1931, as well as receiving instruction from Artur Schnabel and Karl Muck. Leitner became known mainly as an opera conductor. He promoted 20th-century German opera, especially the works of Carl Orff and Karl-Amadeus Hartmann. He also promoted the works of Ferruccio Busoni. His premieres include the operas Oedipus the King by Carl Orff (1959), Don Juan und Faust (1950) as well as Hamlet (1980), both by Hermannn Reutter. He succeeded Erich Kleiber as conductor of the German operas at the Teatro Colón in Buenos Aires in 1956. From 1969 to 1984, he was senior musical director of the Zürich Opera and from 1976 to 1980 principal conductor of the Residence Orchestra in The Hague at the same time.

Shifting between fiery and melancholic, the tango nuevo is just irresistible. Born in 1971 in Münster, Germany, Friedemann Eichhorn studied violin with Prof. Valery Gradow in Mannheim, Alberto Lysy at the International Menuhin Music Academy in Switzerland and with Margaret Pardee at the Juilliard School New York. He regularly performs with orchestras such as St. Petersburg Philharmonic or the SWR-Radio-Orchestra and has concertized with Yuri Bashmet, Saschko Gawriloff, Gidon Kremer, Yehudi Menuhin and Igor Oistrakh. The German cellist Julius Berger studied at the Musikhochschule of Munich, Germany under Walter Reichardt and Fritz Kiskalt. Later, he studied at the Mozarteum in Salzburg, Austria under Antonio Janigro and at the University of Cincinnati under Zara Nelsova. When he was just 28 years old he was appointed to the Musikhochschule Wuerzburg and was one of the youngest Professors in Germany. A native of Buenos Aires, José Gallardo started piano lessons at the age of five, at first at the Conservatory in Buenos Aires, later continuing his studies with Poldi Mildner in the Faculty of Music at the University of Mainz, where he completed his diploma in 1997.

These lesser-known works by Berlioz are worth discovering, even more so when interpreted by the SWR Vokalensemble. The ensemble is led by Sylvian Cambreling. French-born conductor Sylvain Cambreling is a musician with big ideas. A thought-provoking, colorful and dramatic artist, he has a flair for grabbing the attention of audiences, yet his originality is rooted in thorough knowledge of musicology.

Every magical detail of the interaction between Matthias Lingenfelder, Jens Oppermann, Stewart Eaton und Andreas Arndt becomes clear. This ambitious multichannel recording is no high tech version of stereo, for many listeners it is equal to a live concert. An outstanding career spanning three decades has made the Auryn Quartet one of the most sought-after and respected ensembles performing around the globe. The Quartet has not changed its personnel over this long period, and continues with its fresh and pioneering approach to all genres of music.

Sargent; Arthur Shepherd; Leilei Tian; Ethan Wickman        ,Scott Holden: The Unknown Galaxy - A Century of Classical Mormon Music,Scott Holden,,CD,12.4722,19.99,"This album reflects the musical trends of the last one hundred years by highlighting the diversity of the composers that have sprung from the large demographic of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (often referred to as the Mormon or LDS Church). In addition, it focuses on music that showcases the expressive and virtuosic potential of the piano. There is a small but relatively unknown galaxy of repertoire deserving attention in this specific genre, and pianist Scott Holden was thrilled for this opportunity to turn attention to it. Holden writes, ""None of the music presented here has any overt connections with the usual musical traditions or doctrine of the LDS faith. However, one must admit that the spiritual beliefs and experiences of the composers have deeply infused their creative processes. Does this define these pieces as LDS music or simply music by LDS composers? I agree with author Madeleine L'Engle, who stated in Walking on Water, 'There is nothing so secular that it cannot be sacred, and that is one of the deepest messages of the Incarnation.' To create is to touch upon the divine. The result is powerful, mystical, visceral, ecstatic, imaginative, and deeply moving, but it certainly is not your grandmother's typical recital of 'LDS Music.'""",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=TCD0218TUG&medium=phy#,01 Classical,Classical,,United States,2018 Tantara Records,2018 Tantara Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It reflects the personal integrity to which Shostakovich paid heart-felt tribute: 'Shebalin was an outstanding man. His kindness, honesty and absolute adherence to principle always amazed me. His enormous talent and great mastery immediately earned him burning love and authority with friends and musical community.'

But Klengel was an important early-Romantic composer and celebrated piano virtuoso, with a reputation that stretched from St Petersburg to London. This first recording of his piano and chamber music reveals a personality with a strong lyrical impulse, somewhere between Field, Mendelssohn and Chopin, all three of whom he knew personally. Founded in 2016, Trio Klengel is named after August Klengel with the purpose of promoting his works. The ensemble decided to continue the work of the original Klengel Trio, founded in 1912. This trio consisted of the three daughters of the composer Julius Klengel, a relative of August Klengel. Just like the first Klengel Trio, this ensemble is also dedicated to promoting chamber music of long-forgotten composers and their works through concerts and recording projects.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=TOCC0417&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Germany,2018 Toccata Classics,2018 Toccata Classics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This anthology of piano music from the last twenty years of his life reveals a muse that could also be affectionate, flirtatious and capricious – but the 'Bad Boy' occasionally re-emerged, as in the diabolical mischief of the wild, peppery, Prokofievan toccatas also recorded here. Ms. Judy Pang is increasingly on demand as an inventive solo and chamber musician with eclectic repertoire. She has established herself as a performer of works both mainstream and contemporary. Alongside her dedication to a wide-ranging selection from the canon of piano repertoire, she has continued her scholarly study of French impressionist music, on which she has given lecture recitals both in New York and Shanghai.

Some parts of it are unplayable by a single pair of hands, but with judicious arrangement this working draft can be mined for diamonds. Only a handful of musicians have made their own suites for solo piano; here the Lithuanian pianist Indre Petrauskaite, carefully observing Ravel's original textures, has produced something new: a 40-minute concert suite of unsuspected Ravel for solo piano that also respects the dramatic outline of the original ballet. The other, more familiar works here extend the ideas of antiquity and transcription.

In 1955, Stockhausen declared that music would have to be created anew amid the rubble of the past. His Klavierstücke I-XI for piano are not based on a linear belief in progress, but on a personal mix of scientific knowledge and religious conviction. The underlying theme of this music is the tension between objectively measured time and our subjective experience of time. Stockhausen deliberately restricted himself to a single instrument, believing that the neutrality and universality of the piano's sound allowed a comprehensive and transparent exploration of sound colors and structures. In Sabine Liebner's precise and sensitive interpretation, the fascination of these piano pieces is apparent. The intensity of the individual sound events and our experience of the dual nature of time allow us to truly ""hear"" – the ultimate goal of Stockhausen's art.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=WER73412&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Piano,Austria,2018 Wergo,2018 Wergo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
