His instrumental works - symphonies, concertos, octets, quartets, and trios - were as popular as his vocal music. Certain features of his melodic style reflect his Bohemian origins, and Myslivecek's influence on his contemporaries was significant. A close friend of the young Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and a musical influence on him, Mozart described Myslivecek’s character as ""full of fire, spirit and life."" All nine of the Myslivecek violin concertos that survive in complete form were probably written in a short period during the late 1760s and early 1770s when the composer maintained close contacts with the city of Padua and the composer and violinist Giuseppe Tartini. As a representative of Italian traditions that extended back to the early eighteenth century, Myslivecek’s violin concertos are all cast in three movements of the pattern ‘fast-slow-fast’. “From this music one can hear that the author was also a superb opera composer: the quickly alternating themes are well defined in character, whether sounding serious or boisterous, pleading or alluring, questioning or majestic, friendly or imperious. Figuratively, we find ourselves on the opera stage.” (Leila Schayegh)",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=ACC%2024336&medium=phydig#,01 Classical,Classical,,Austria,2018 Note 1 Music,2018 Note 1 Music,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He was entrusted with the first ever recordings of such masterworks as the Schubert and Schumann Fantasies, and these and his Liszt performances reveal a true Romantic virtuoso who was nevertheless equally at home in the Classicism of the Haydn sonata he recorded in early 1925 – another gramophone premiere. Gramophone wrote in 1928: “Rehberg has done well, his technique is equal to the formidable demands made on it, but his virtuosity never blinds him to the imaginative qualities of the music… I have nothing but admiration for a rendering that is both competent and poetical.” Rehberg was also a champion of the Janko piano, an instrument that allowed the easier playing of larger intervals and complex chords.

Bach, Biber, Marini, Corelli: four leading figures of Baroque music that no one would associate with the harp. However, they worked in environments where there is ample evidence that harpists were active, and where a solo harp repertory certainly existed, even if it was never written down. This ambitious project starts out from that premise, and is the result of in-depth research into original sources. It suggests that the repertory for violin, an instrument that shares many idiomatic features with the harp, was long a source of inspiration for harpists. Hence, here some of the best-known and most virtuosic pieces for the violin have been arranged for harp, giving these compositions a new lease on life and shedding light on new and unexpected nuances and reflections.

The seventh installment in the series was premièred at the Edinburgh Festival in 2017, and was described by one reviewer as “Inspiringly commanding, thoughtful, lucid and sheerly beautiful” (The Herald, Glasgow). Haefliger’s programme opens with Alban Berg’s Piano Sonata, Op. 1, a highly concentrated work in which most of the music can be traced back to the two opening gestures. This is followed by Liszt’s impressionistic Légende No. 1 ‘St. Francis of Assisi: The Sermon to the Birds’, in which we seem to hear a flock of birds chirp warble and sing. At the core of the programme is Beethoven’s Op.101 Sonata – a work which in Haefliger’s opinion points more clearly towards Schumann than any other of the composer’s sonatas.

In his own liner notes, Lindberg describes his method of working, and explains the background of the three pieces recorded here with the Odense Symphony Orchestra.

In a classical, three-movement concerto form, the work isn’t programmatic as such, but while composing it, Lindberg was reminded of the novel by Hermann Hesse.

Devised by Carolyn Sampson and Joseph Middleton, the present recital brings us each of those possibilities and more. The playwright Helmina von Chézy wrote the text to the tender Romanze, intending it for the play Rosamunde, Princess of Cyprus to which Schubert composed incidental music. Another female author, Marianne von Willemer, wrote the two Suleika poems for Goethe, who included them (under his own name) in the collection West-ostlicher Divan. And no less than seven of the other songs on the album are also associated with Goethe, and his characters Mignon (from Wilhelm Meisters Lehrjahre) and Gretchen (from Faust). Schubert was for a while almost obsessed with the mysterious and waif-like Mignon, making several settings of the poems associated with her. Less of an enigma but equally moving, Schubert’s Gretchen sings of awakening desire (Gretchen am Spinnrade) and laments her coming disgrace (Gretchens Bitte). Carolyn Sampson and Joseph Middleton have collaborated on several acclaimed projects for BIS, most recently with the counter-tenor Iestyn Davies as their companion. Here they close their Soprano’s Schubertiade with three settings of poems by Walter Scott, albeit in German translations.

His sound wasn’t as dense and carefully crafted, but the ensemble’s playing became lighter and more flexible, agile rather than probing. It is in his Stuttgart period that Marriner increasingly focused on repertoire that went beyond the baroque and classical periods. This compilation offers repertoire which music lovers will be less likely to associate with Marriner: German romanticism, including all of Schumann’s Symphonies, Richard Strauss, Tchaikovsky and Rachmaninoff, Mahler, Bartok and Gershwin – The fundamental impression that comes from re-listening to these performances, apart from good and fresh music-making, is one of sympathetic music-making.

The artists approach these works as Bach intended: as trio sonatas with equally important roles for the violin and the harpsichord’s treble and bass lines. In addition to the six Sonatas, the album offers the remarkable and ravishingly poetic Cantabile, BWV 1019a, a free-standing work that Bach originally conceived as a movement of the Sonata, BWV 1019. Cedille’s audiophile engineering and the intimate acoustics of Evanston, Illinois’s Nichols Hall allow the complex trio textures to blossom with detail. In all, the album sets a new standard for a body of work that Bach’s son, CPE, considered among his father’s finest compositions. Rachel Barton Pine is a Billboard chart-topping artist. Her 2016 album ‘Testament,’ comprising JS Bach’s Sonatas and Partitas for solo violin entered the Billboard Classical Chart in the No. 1 position, as did her 2013 Cedille album ‘Violin Lullabies.’ Making his Cedille label debut, Vinikour received Grammy Award nominations in the category of Best Solo Instrumental Recording for his 2013 album of modern American music for harpsichord and his 2012 release of Rameau’s complete harpsichord works.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=CDR%20177&medium=phy#,01 Classical,Classical,,United States,2018 Cedille Records,2018 Cedille Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Without losing the romance, the violence, eroticism and devotion of the traditional tango that he saw as empty and hollowed out, Piazzolla renewed and modified it with elements of European art music, Argentine folklore and jazz, and thus tango took on a new meaning and shape. The writer Alberto Rodriguez Munoz approached Piazzolla in 1961 with a request to write music for his play Tango del angel, which is about an angel appearing in an apartment block in Buenos Aires to cleanse the souls of its inhabitants. The titles Introduccion al angel, Milonga del angel, and Muerte del angel were created. The latter, a four-part fugue with hard, uncompromising harmonies and rhythms, impressively shows how far Piazzolla pushed the boundaries of traditional tango. When they play was performed in 1962, even the previously hostile parts of ht emusical public in Argentina had to admit how fitting and successful this music was and the titles, especially Milonga del angel, gained extraordinary popularity. The motives of Angel and Diablo appear in many of the tangos composed by Astor Piazzolla: “In my story, angels and devils mix- you have to have something in everything.”",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=CC%2072776&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Austria,2018 Challenge Classics,2018 Challenge Classics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Will De Raaff follow in the footsteps of tradition, or will he give the name, the form, a new meaning, a new direction? His symphonies have little to do with the classical concept. Of course, his love for composing was partly derived from the symphonies of composers such as Brahms, Mahler, Shostakovich, Prokofiev, and even Bernstein, but De Raaf is too much of a constructivist to write a symphony in the classical sense of the word. De Raaff became more and more convinced there was something to be gained in the concertante form, the orchestra and the soloist, the individual and the crowd. He shies away from prescribed forms and developments, a recapitulated theme followed by various movements with different characters. The symphony, the orchestral apparatus sounding together, telling its story for a period of at least twenty minutes, is what he took as his starting point. Working from there, this led to a reinterpretation of the symphonic form. De Raaff’s Second and Fourth Symphonies are the result of a reinterpretation of works for a soloist or soloist group with accompaniment. They are a revision of the material, reminiscent of the way in which Pierre Boulez let Incises for piano grow into Sur incises for ensemble and how Luciano Berio recomposed a number of his Sequenzas into Chemins.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=CC%2072762&medium=phy#,01 Classical,Classical,,Austria,2018 Challenge Classics,2018 Challenge Classics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco, already an inventive composer for Andrés Segovia’s guitar, wrote prolifically also for the Presti-Lagoya duo.

Charles II’s formal Restoration in 1660 marked both an end and a beginning: the end of England’s republican experiment and the beginning of a long process of monarchical reconstruction; and with a politically accident-prone king on the throne, Charles’s public relations machine could never rest. Purcell joined its small team of composer operatives just as the wave of Stuart propaganda swelled massively, and he surfed the wave with breathtaking panache, from his first court ode – the simple but rousing Welcome, Vicegerent of the mighty King – to the ambitious Fly, bold rebellion involving verse settings in up to seven parts and a six-part chorus. “Christophers creates a vivid sense of celebration and occasion, conjuring blustering trumpet fanfares and drum-rolls from his ensemble, while his solo singers pre-empt the textural variety and rhetorical sensitivity of Purcell’s stage works…” (Gramophone)",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=COR16163&medium=phy#,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Choral,United Kingdom,2018 The Sixteen Productions Ltd.,2018 The Sixteen Productions Ltd.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He was a familiar figure in popular concert guides until well into the 1930s. In Wilhelm Altmann’s ‘Handbuch fur Streichquartettspieler (1929), for example, we read the following words on the String Sextet by this ‘subtle Hamburg composer’: “Though Krug’s Sextet by no means stands out with particular idiosyncrasy, it can hold its own with flying colors. In point of melody and sound the most successful movement is the deeply felt Adagio tranquillo, interrupted by an urgent and dramatic interlude in which yet another Tranquillo, almost doleful and certainly imploring, has been interpolated.” Successful, fresh, exhilarating- and for more than 40 years!

Born in Nuremberg in 1649, he was active as a chapel master at the Weißenfels court from 1680 to 1725. During his tenure as music director Weißenfels became a leading center of the early German Baroque opera. With his compositional oeuvre Krieger made important contributions to the development of the church cantata and instrumental music. Following the publication of his twelve Sonate a due Violini, CPO is now presenting the recording premiere of five of the total of twenty Sacred Concertos from his Musicalischer Seelen-Frieden, a work composed in 1690 and 1696 and presented in Weißenfels religious services. Krieger, a practicing musician with a practical mind, designed flexible parts for solo voice and two violins in this collection. He produces a close word-tone relation, and the alternations between concertizing and cantabile parts provide for vibrancy. It is especially in the “I-related” texts that inserted recitatives and accompagnati generate special emphases. For almost four decades the bass baritone Klaus Mertens has met with acclaim from the critics for his concerts and almost two hundred recordings.

On the one side, an even-tempered master of piano courses and études with a virtually baroque self-understanding enabling him to compose everything for which he received an order; on the other side, a fiery archromanticist for whom every work involved a struggle with demons. And yet these extreme positions from the nineteenth century fit together perfectly, just like a medallion cut in two.

Although David takes an intellectual approach, he never fails to offer sensuous moments of fascination. Accordingly, the character of Symphony No. 2 is distinguished not only by great vitality but also by a vital musical imagination.

Although this period was distinguished by musical forms of great diversity and variability, there was one clear premise: the immediacy of musical expression. Consequently, the person of Orpheus became one of the most important figures. He was the singer who accompanied himself on the lyre and expressed his deepest feelings textually and musically. The successful tenor Julian Prégardien teams up with the ensemble Teatro del Mondo led by Andreas Kuppers, who has assisted René Jacobs and others for many years, to trace the representation and reception of this mythical singer in the seventeenth century. Accompanied by a great many instruments, the musicians cover the first operas in Italy, spend time with part songs and lute songs from England, and discover song collections from Germany. Dances and diminutions function as interludes. This is an album like a painting: Orpheus sings and plays in the midst of shepherds, nymphs, animals, trees, and stones. In 2016 Die Rheinpfalz wrote after an “Orpheus Concert”: “With Julian Prégardien and the early music ensemble Teatro del Mondo we found ourselves in the uppermost reaches of Baroque vocal and instrumental music.

The Eos Guitar Quartet at any rate – although it most certainly has a practical bent too – decided against new music stands and for a journey of adventure – naturally one accompanied by 24 strings. The idea was to put together 20 miniature compositions by 20 different composers in order to celebrate the passing of 20 years and take the step into the next 20. After all, 20 years of Eos are hardly enough. So Project 20+ was born. Ultimately, 21 musicians from all over the world took part – as indicated by the formula 20+.

It was an immediate success, and for 40 years it was considered the outstanding British piano concerto, performed by all the leading players of the day such as Clifford Curzon, Moura Lympany and Artur Rubinstein. This release co-incides with the 100th anniversary of the birth of Annarosa Taddei, the pianist in the Ireland Piano Concerto. This recording was made at the Italian premièr of the work. The Cello Sonata of Ireland is one of his most deeply passionate and expressive works. The recording on this album was issued for the first time in September 1929. Ireland is the pianist, and the cellist is the Catalan Antoni Sala who discovered the sonata, and came to London to give many performances and recorded it with the composer. If there were prizes on offer for the most-travelled composer of the twentieth century, the one who gave the most concerts, or the one who did most to help his composing colleagues, the Italian Alfredo Casella might well sweep the board. The catalogue of his activities as composer, arranger, conductor, keyboard player, teacher, concert organizer, writer and editor is simply mind-boggling. This FHR issue unites the only surviving (broadcast) recordings of Casella the orchestral conductor and Casella performing on piano with orchestra. Judging it to be one of his best pieces, Casella said of his Triple Concerto ‘the great success my Concerto has met with right across Europe and both Americas’ (North and South), recalling with particular enthusiasm the Trio Italiano’s appearance with the ‘prodigious’ Boston Symphony Orchestra and their conductor Serge Koussevitzky early in 1936.",https://youtu.be/KlM1tttfhR0,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=FHR63&medium=phy#,01 Classical,Classical,,United Kingdom,2018 First Hand Records,2018 First Hand Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On the latest release of the Rembrandt Frerichs trio this unlikely combination has come together. And how! This mix of sounds has never before been heard, certainly not in jazz. The chosen repertoire is equally unorthodox: the trio play original compositions, baroque repertoire, modern improvisations and even Herbie Hancock’s jazz-rock hit “Butterfly.” Piano pioneer Rembrandt Frerichs developed a unique playing style on the fortepiano, an idea that was spawned by the many collaborations with musicians from the Middle East. The National Musical Instrument fund had such an instrument built for Rembrandt by Chris Maene in Belgium. In response to this, Tony Overwater started to master the violone, precursor to the double bass. Vinsent Planjer complements this with an unconventional collection of percussion instruments from all over the world. The Trio demonstrates that instruments from centuries gone by can sound totally modern when placed into a new context.

An instrumental composition gives us access to a composer’s imagination and invention as far as the composer chooses to let us see, but a song shows a composer’s highly personal response to a text – we hear how the composer reacts to another facet of creativity. We are not confined to the composer’s own thoughts, and the best songs take us into a composer’s creative mind. Cyril Scott’s compositional style reflected the color and richness of his ideas. The songs on this release cover a period from his early 20s to when he was about 40. A few of Scott’s songs became extraordinarily popular: they undoubtedly overshadowed the rest of his work. In many of his songs, he explored and developed his harmonic language, and set the mood and character of the text, so that the best can be explored at many levels.

That is why Slobodkin’s miniatures matter so much today as a high example, especially for the young generation of cellists. The wealth of expressive capabilities of the cello, subtle sense of style and richness of artistic phrasing distinguish his performance of Russian works. His cello sounds lightly and gracefully in virtuosic and dance melodies.

Aylen Pritchin’s and Yuri Favorin’s infrequent joint performances are known for their quite extraordinary repertoire. It’s in this spirit that they present this album of Sergei Prokofiev’s music.

When Beethoven arrived there ten years later, Vienna was still a perfect place for a talented musician. In the imperial capital many aristocratic families provided opportunities to artists: concerts, commissions and the possibility to teach their children. In the same period in Vienna there was a large, prosperous middle-class who provided a market for new music publications, especially folk songs, dances and chamber music. The Serenade for flute, violin and viola (Op.25) composed by Beethoven between 1795 and 96, printed late in 1802 by Cappi in Vienna, was also published in Leipzig in 1803 by Hoffmeister & Kuhnel in the version for Serenade fur Flote und Klavier Op.41, D-Dur. In this second destination the part of the flute has remained unchanged while the piano appears to have had, according to the author, ""small but substantial improvements"". On commission from Scottish folk music collector George Thompson, Beethoven wrote no less than sixteen piano variations on traditional European folk melodies. Later, requested by the publishing house, he composed the Variationen uber Volkslieder fur Flote und Klavier Op.105. These variations of admirable difficulty for flute and piano with a simple but fascinating ad libitum in the part of the flute that, with minor modifications, was also performed with the violin. The Variationen fur Flote und Klavier Op.107, ten variations on national themes, are the last compositions that Beethoven wrote for George Thomson. Thomson's publications were intended for amateurs.

On & Between is a musical exploration of the dualities and the accompanying anticipation, agony, pride and compromise – poignantly capturing the states of mind of an immigrant on the journey of home-seeking and assimilation. Award winning composer Zhen Chen explores new possibilities by weaving traditional Chinese music instruments and folk tone with piano and Western style chamber music. A sweeping and at times epic recording, On & Between is a masterstroke of sophisticated storytelling performed by a stellar ensemble of musicians.

Goodman grasps the listener’s attention right away with Roger Dannenberg’s “Separation Logic” for flute and live computer processing. In this futuristic work it is the listener’s responsibility to determine what is real and what is imagined as his ears are fed short melodic phrases that have been electronically manipulated. It’s this sort of electronic genius that allows Goodman to play a duet with herself in the second track, David Stock’s “A Wedding Prayer” for 2 flutes, stark and striking. In Tony Zilincik’s “I Asked You” for solo flute and mixed media, Goodman competes with samples of spoken text and percussion riffs in “Everything I Love.” “I Play Music” boasts a similar challenge, but without percussion and with the addition of the atmospheric pads of a modern synthesizer and the sound of ocean waves. Elainie Lillios’s “Sleep’s Undulating Tide” for flute in C and live, interactive electroacoustics seems to be a continuation of the previous Zilincik track, until the entrance of a ghostly mezzo-soprano voice--the flutist’s herself. Next is Linda Kernohan’s “Demon:Daemon,” a performance art piece in which the flutist is both musician and actor as she is seemingly possessed by an evil spirit. Randall Woolf’s “The Line of Purples” for flute and pre-recorded electronics is the least harmonically experimental of the works so far, but perhaps the most complex to categorize. In Judith Shatin’s “For the Fallen” for amplified flute and electronics the listener must decide who is fallen--Adam and Eve? A young soldier? Or the listener herself?

Let yourself relax down into what are the key feature blueprints of your life’s sun sign. The twelve songs in the Cosmic Wheel cycle cover a universal span, from each sign’s deepest motivation for love, to each soul’s most heartfelt desire for spiritual expression. Journey with Aries, the first primal force of the calendar year, to Taurus’ expression of security, and onward to Gemini’s mercurial desire for freedom.

In addition to renowned soloists Jungwon Choi, Moni Simeonov, the recording features the composer’s wife Sing Rose and the composer himself. The album also features the Moravian Philharmonic under the direction of Miran Vaupotic. Rose stuns from the outset with his imaginative piano concerto “Tolkien Tale,” a programmatic fantasy with clear Eastern European folk elements. In the first movement “Setting out on a great adventure,” the listener, perhaps on a journey with famed hobbit Bilbo Baggins, is introduced to playful syncopations and pentatonic explorations -- perhaps in homage to folk explorations of Bartok, Brahms, Dvorak, and Prokofiev. The warm “Lullaby,” the second movement, is a short interlude, a breathtaking look at tandem possibilities for keyboard instruments and woodwinds. Concluding the work is “March,” a continuation of the fanciful literary journey with musically atmospheric projections of things encountered along the way. Next is “Old Father Time” for cello and orchestra, a nostalgic, yet timeless work demonstrating the composer’s mastery of the neo-Romantic style and the complexities of storytelling through music. The two-minute violin introduction to “25,000 Years of Peace” is modern, seemingly improvisational and likewise experimental. The violinist somehow replicates the hollow breaths heard in folk woodwinds. It is meditative and almost religious. Direction is unclear. But then the grand orchestra enters and the listener is transported to the Western frontier in an Ives-like montage of New World folk tune, Native American chant, and Shaker hymnsong.

Compositionally, the overarching style is one of charismatic sentiment, accented by the bright timbre of Lacroix’s piano. The work is altogether lovely and a wonderful introduction to “Susannah’s Lullaby (This is a Face of Love),” and “Language of a Rose,” the first two art songs included on the album. “Moyi mamij” [For My Mother] is an exquisite quartet that brings a tear to the eye of anyone who has ever felt a mother’s love. In that sentiment, let’s hope that Princes William and Harry will have the opportunity to hear Estelle’s “Qu’est-ce que c’est la vie? [What is life?]"" a homage to “The People’s Princess,” for which Estelle wrote not only the music, but the French text. In “Abwoon d’bwashmaya” [Aramaic Lord’s Prayer], Estelle’s writing is reverent and prayerful -- blending perfectly the melodic sonorities of the soprano voice and the cello. Estelle showcases her choral writing with the inclusion of four works: “Water Canticle (For Margaret Trudeau),” “La chanson de ton coeur” [The Song of Your Heart], “Child of the Manger,” and “Song for Abwoon.” Estelle, who once put music aside to appease her parents by studying psychology and accounting instead, is now a well-respected composer in Canada. She relates, “When you see people around the world are listening to and loving your songs, you know composing is something you should take seriously.”",https://youtu.be/3JQKPAvNl5s,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=NV6161&medium=phy#,01 Classical,Classical,Classical,United States,2018 Navona Records,2018 Navona Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Living up to its name, Moto Bello, or “beautiful motion,” is a collection celebrating the synergy of Trio Casals and the vibrant works of ten contemporary composers including Diane Jones, Beth Mehocic, David N. Stewart, Sidney Bailin, L Peter Deutsch, Giovanni Piacentini, Adrienne Albert, Clive Muncaster, Joanne D. Carey, and Bruce Babcock. Moto Bello is a journey through individual experience, international scenes, and philosophical pondering. Each piece is an exploration of movement and of the beauty in all forms of motion—dissonant and jagged, soft and freely flowing, or standing tentatively between the two. In some instances, the pieces are romantic and sweeping, as in Ondine, Nightfall, Palette No. 1, the beginning moments of Solo la Sombra. In others, the energetic experience is driven and leaping, as in Woman A/Part, Somewhere Between D and C#, Habanera, Lines, Hockets, and Riffs, and Imagined/Remembered. Moto Bello is a diverse tapestry of emotional, energetic, and imaginative listening experiences. Trio Casals demonstrates not only the imaginativeness of the composers, but also the group’s technical prowess as they communicate the unique meaning and motion behind each composition. On Moto Bello, the ensemble exists as the dynamic storyteller of each composer’s artistic statement, weaving each tale of beauty in motion with their own inspired story.",https://youtu.be/NoIrTQqTP2Q,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=NV6156&medium=phy#,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Chamber Music,United States,2018 Navona Records,2018 Navona Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tanner is no Stranger to Navona; his compositions and arrangements can be heard on two other Navona releases: Of Birds and Lemons (2012) and Dashing (2016). This was his first album, featuring him as a performer. It includes two unaccompanied pieces and two sax quartets recorded by multi-tracking, as well as a rich variety of works with accompaniment admirably rendered by pianist Marc Widner. The music ranges from Schumann to a stylized blues by Gene DiNovi. Tanner's musical language is enriched by classical training and a career encompassing rock'n'roll and jazz as well as symphony. Reviewer Denis Armstrong wrote in Music Magazine, ""Not long into this recording, one begins to marvel at the sheer joy David Tanner's playing conveys... a dense and rich recording... at times elegant and elegiac, other times ribald and visceral. But the one constant is the joy and clarity of expression."" The first track sets the tone: ""Serenade comique"" is a brief, frantic sax quartet composition that evokes Parisian traffic or perhaps a flock of birds. ""La Blues,"" the other quartet selection, evokes the melancholy of New York in the depth of night. ""It is a treat for the listener to hear this feat of multi-tracking done so well,"" said reviewer Joseph Viola in Saxophone Journal. Each track is in contrast to the one before it; each represents something different and interesting.

In the ‘Variations on a Theme of Correlli,’ Rachmaninoff reworks the original theme using his unique harmonic language until there is no trace left of its Baroque or Renaissance origins. Pianist Boris Giltburg was born in 1984 in Moscow and has lived in Tel Aviv since early childhood. He began lessons with his mother at the age of five and went on to study with Arie Vardi. In 2013 he took first prize at the Queen Elisabeth Competition, catapulting his career to a new level.

Luzzaschi’s Madrigali a uno, due e tre soprano of 1601 represents the sole surviving publication of a unique and highly important repertoire; that of the much famed singing ladies (concerto delle donne) of Ferrara. By the 1580s the Duke of Ferrara, Alfonso II, had become so obsessed with the sound of soprano voices, that he was procuring the finest singers of the time and establishing them in his court for his musica secreta, or secret music. It is among the most vocally challenging music surviving, and attests to high quality of vocal training in the sixteenth century. It is something of a miracle that even one copy of the original publication survived. In an age when singer/composers were relatively common, no single woman had as much of her music published as Barbara Strozzi. She led a remarkable life and one most unusual for a woman in Venice in 1619. Her father, poet Giulio Strozzi, was at the centre of the cultural and intellectual life in Venice and through him she was able to partake of that life. Between 1644 and 1664 Barbara Strozzi published 8 books of vocal music. By far the majority of this output is for solo soprano, but just how successful she was is unknown. After her final publication in 1664 nothing more is known of her. As she wrote herself in the dedication to her opus 5: “Since I am no more held back by feminine weakness than by any allowance made for my sex, I fly on lightest leaves in devotion to make my bow.”",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=SAR072&medium=phy,30 World/Int'l.,World,Classical|Art Song,United Kingdom,2018 Saydisc Records,2018 Saydisc Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This recording includes the world première recording of Schumann’s 17-minute Adventlied, Op. 71 for soloists, chorus and orchestra, four choral ballades based on texts by Emanuel Geibel, and Schumann’s version of Bach’s Cantata BWV 105. Robert Schumann wrote in 1850: “Keep in mind that there are also singers, and that the highest in musical expression is achieved through the chorus and orchestra.” This illustrates well the composer’s desire to write large works for this medium in an attempt to create a new genre for the concert hall. Today, they still constitute the least explored area of his output. The elevated style he was aspiring to was unheard-of outside the realm of church music. In fact, whether for the church, opera, or the concert hall, Schumann was looking for a sanctified realm, a Goethe-inspired meeting ground for art and religion. Adventlied, Op. 71, was written in November 1848 to a text from Friedrich Ruckert’s Pantheon. Estonian Philharmonic Chamber Choir (EPCC) is one of the best-known Estonian music groups in the world. The repertoire of the choir extends from baroque to contemporary music, focusing on the work of Estonian composers.

In this new recording the Latvian Radio Choir under Sigvards Klava offers impressive renditions of music from this collection by the Russian master. Sviridov, a pupil of Shostakovich, began writing religious works in 1969. Since then these works have come to form an important part of his oeuvre. In the 1980s Sviridov had several projects to write a liturgy or a mass. In the end, the sketches of his sacred music came to form a cycle titled Canticles and Prayers. The work was created at a turning point in the history of Russia, the perestroika years that ended in the collapse of the Soviet state. The composer was keenly affected by the events of those years, building a monument to his era. The main body of Canticles and Prayers was assembled between 1988 and 1992. In September 1997, Sviridov selected the versions he thought best, approving the final order for the first three parts and making the final edits to the score. This work remained incomplete at the time of his death in 1998. Canticles and Prayers was thus Sviridov’s last work. The recording also includes the chorus The Red Easter based on a cycle of Easter hymns. Previous releases of the Latvian Radio Choir on Ondine have been highly successful. For instance, the recording of Rachmaninoff’s All-Night Vigil was chosen as the Record of the Month, Editor’s Choice and received a nomination in the Gramophone Awards in 2013.

Les Pêcheurs de perles contains a quintessentially French blend of lyricism, exoticism and drama, and the four soloists (Julie Fuchs as Leïla, Cyrille Dubois as Nadir, Florian Sempey as Zurga and Luc Bertin-Hugault as Nourabad) belong to today’s best performers for this specialist repertoire. Their vocal excellence is matched by the choral contributions of Les Cris de Paris. The rich sound palette of Les Pêcheurs is fully brought to life by the inspired playing of the Orchestre National de Lille under the baton of its new Music Director Alexandre Bloch.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=PTC5186685&medium=phy#,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Opera,Germany,2018 PENTATONE,2018 PENTATONE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Composed shortly after L’Orfeo and dedicated to Pope Paul V, Monteverdi’s Vespers constantly surprise us with their audacity and their great emotional power. Stile antico and stile moderno combine here to wonderful effect, with Renaissance-style polyphony, accompanied monody and concertato style coexisting harmoniously. The importance accorded to the text (a key feature in Monteverdi), the virtuosity of the vocal writing and the independence of the part-writing are among the characteristics of this astonishing work.

Numerous composers' works, for example, were banned as ""degenerate"" by the Nazis. Even so, Vsevolod Zaderatsky's fate was exceptional. It remains unprecedented that a composer of Zaderatsky's rank should spend his whole life under such political suppression and that he had absolutely no opportunity to present his music to the public in any way at all. Not a single work of his was published during his lifetime and there were no performances worth mentioning. It is a marvel that he even survived Stalinism; many of his compositions did not survive, having either been deliberately destroyed or fallen victim to circumstances. Zaderatsky's life seems to have been a hopeless, unequal battle: a musician against all-powerful state machinery intent on destroying his works and even threatening his life. The background to the 24 Preludes and Fugues for piano marks a particularly dramatic chapter of his struggle during detention in the Gulag.

But when they are played, as Ingolf Turban does, with all piquant bravado and wit and taste, then they are musical fun … He played the concertos with a very taut and steely tone which was able to elicit a smile, even considering the indescribable wizardry of technique. One could not miss hearing how Paganini understood Rossini´s artistry with song He had fused some of this artistry into the parts for violin, as was brought out by Ingolf Turban through his ever elegant, glitteringly clear, and supremely singing production of tone. And to top it all, Turban´s playing of Paganini lacked neither a drew-like fresh fantasy of sound nor an extraordinarily playful vigor. And thus one could enjoy these concertos of that satanic violinist enveloped by legend.” We naturally listen to music today differently from the public of Paganini´s time. But we must be aware of the circumstances of that time, and have an ear for relationships. The need is all the more for a rational stance that is equally joyful and anxious. Smiling is only one aspect of Paganini. When our senses fade while facing the bravura, so do our hearing and sight dim before the tremendous plunges that this music conceals within itself, from heaven to earth and then out again to the infinite. The only comparison can be with Chopin at the piano. He performed such plunges, from so soft as to be barely audible to abrupt change of touch. There is eloquent testimony that bears this out. Ingolf Turban, in his attempt to revive the characteristics of happening for the Paganini concertos wants to do justice to both of these dimensions.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=PH14010&medium=phy#,01 Classical,Classical,,Germany,"2000, 2003, 2005 by WDR; 2000, 2003, 2005 by telos music",2014 Profil Median,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Which works sound best in which environment? Where can the spirit and character of the music most clearly be expressed? These questions are what inspired the conductor Gerd Schaller to embark on an ambitious major project in 2007: in the impressive environment of the abbey church that once formed part of Ebrach’s Cistercian monastery in Franconia, he directed his festival orchestra, the Philharmonie Festiva, in recordings of all of Anton Bruckner’s symphonies. Nearly all the recordings were made during concerts in the cathedral acoustics of Ebrach’s abbey church. The location Schaller chose for the recordings of the F minor Symphony, the early D minor Symphony and the Fourth Symphony with its Volksfest finale is the Regentenbau building in Bad Kissingen, which likewise has outstanding acoustics. What is special about this Bruckner cycle is that Schaller in some cases selected less well-known, “interim” versions or variants that had previously never been performed but give revealing insights into Bruckner’s compositional approach. Featured for the first time ever in this edition are Bruckner’s Third in its first revised form of 1874 and his Eighth in the interim version of 1888. The cycle of symphonies is supplemented by the F minor Mass, the rarely performed Psalm 146 and his organ works. To crown the Bruckner cycle, the unfinished Ninth has been recorded twice, augmented by a different finale each time: once with the final movement added by William Carragan and once with Gerd Schaller’s own recreation of the finale.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=PH17024&medium=phy#,01 Classical,Classical,,Germany,2017 Profil Medien,2017 Profil Medien,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These twelve compositions, recorded in several historic American theaters, employ Weber’s strong yet delicate guitar playing along with the acoustics of the rooms in which he recorded. Combining elements of classical and folk, Weber embraces the elegance of high-brow compositions as well as the grit of stripped-down Americana. Conversely, Weber’s interpretation of “America The Beautiful"" cracks the hardened shell of the country’s staple song and exposes the pearl underneath that brings a brand new, marvelous way of looking at the classic. Weber’s folk and classical elements are diversified throughout the album. “Spanish Creek"" combines elements of the tango and flamenco guitar, while the “Jefferson Waltz” maintains that triple time rhythm to inspire the famous gliding dance. Under the influence of the legendary Christopher Parkening, Weber finds his own sound through the humanizing element of folk in his compositions. He employs as much of an Andrés Segovia influence as he does a Jackson Browne influence.

I also have divided my musical life in two parts: as a soloist, (where I improvise a lot) and as an accompanist, when it is very practical to use scores, of course. But as mentioned, my real “I” does not belong to the world of written music, unless I compose music myself. Then this will have another importance for me. My entire musical history is about the polarization of improvisation versus scored music. I cannot live without the notes, but yet feel that improvisations are suppressed by scored music…”",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=CDA1824&medium=phy#,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Piano,United Kingdom,2018 Sterling Records,2018 Sterling Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the other compositions it is the popular song, the Lutheran melody, or even the Trieste canzonetta da strada, the popular version of an original melody by Schrammel, that survive in the sound of the piano, obviously losing the articulation of the words and the original vocal quality but maintaining the vitality of the accent and character of these melodies.” Luca Richelli and Alvise Vidolin supply the electronics on this album, while Aldo Orvieto and Dario Savron perform piano and percussion, respectively.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=STR37093&medium=phy#,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Contemporary Era,Italy,Milano Dischi,Milano Dischi,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He extended the boundaries of program music and took the concept of realism in music to an unprecedented level.

In the studio, he always conducted his own works, recording them for labels such as Deutsche Grammophon, EMI, CBS and Decca. His work as a conductor in the concert hall and his occasional radio studio performances were much more varied, as with the present recording. When we hear Hindemith conducting Bruckner in 1958, we should bear in mind that a grand master is at work, unsurpassed in contrapuntal expertise and musical invention, the product of a vibrant tradition extending from Schutz and Bach to Mozart and Beethoven, and on to Brahms and Reger.

He was the son of a wealthy cloth merchant of Rovereto who at first had destined him for carrying on the family business; but from a very early age he showed a great talent and facility for music. Before he turned twenty he had already learned to play the oboe, the flute, the violin, the viola, and the contrabass. After his father’s death in 1784, Ferrari decided to pursue a musician’s career, and from that time onwards his life was spent travelling a great deal and staying in the major European courts. He followed the Prince of Lichtenstein to Rome and subsequently to Naples, where he became friends with Giovanni Paisiello. The outbreak of the French Revolution forced him to leave Paris (where he lived since 1787) more and more frequently, until in 1792 he relocated once and for all to London. There, at court, he had the chance to meet some great artistic personalities such as Haydn, Clementi, and Dussek. Ferrari became a deep connoisseur and lover of Mozart’s works, so much so that he took on a strictly conservative attitude and refused to adapt to the process of evolution of music that was taking place, by then irreversibly, between the end of the eighteenth century and the first years of the nineteenth. In spite of his admiration for Mozart, Ferrari never gave way to the temptation of becoming an epigone of his, and always preserved a certain degree of stylistic originality. The two collections of sonatas presented in this programme, both probably published within 1795, are among the best examples of this kind.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=TC760601&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Chamber Music,Austria,2018 Tactus Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During the period of his education in his native town, Sinigaglia often stayed in Milan, where he struck up important friendships with Antonio Bazzini (a violinist and composer who was professor of composition from 1873 and became director of the Conservatory of Milan from 1881 onwards), and with his pupils Alfredo Catalani and Giacomo Puccini. Bazzini urged him to travel to Europe to complete his training with the great names of the era, first of all Brahms, who, however, not accepting pupils but recognizing their value, diverted him to Eusebius Mandyczewski, a teacher of great fame and professor of composition at the Vienna Conservatory. From these years in Vienna came the great masterpiece by Sinigaglia: the concert for violin and orchestra included in this prestigious live performance by the young world star Laura Marzadori, first violin of La Scala in Milan.

The son of a prominent cantor, Rosowsky was an eminent scholar of synagogue chant in his own right. His instrumental and vocal chamber music reveals much wider influences, ancient and modern. From a whirling showpiece for piano trio via tender lullabies to the Mediterranean desert evoked in the Biblical drama Jacob and Rachel, Rosowsky’s music embraces the rich and varied heritage of the Jewish people. This is the fourth album in the Toccata ‘Russian Jewish Classics’ series. The musicians of the Pittsburgh Jewish Music Festival are the highest-caliber local professionals; players for the orchestral and chamber music concerts include members of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, the Pittsburgh Opera and Ballet Orchestras, and faculty members of the music departments from Carnegie Mellon and Duquesne Universities.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=TOCC%200479&medium=phy#,01 Classical,Classical,,Germany,2018 Toccata Classics,2018 Toccata Classics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Marianne Dumas researched Bach’s suites, and published a new edition of the suites based on the manuscript copies of the suites and on the research she did.Marianne began her researchs in 2010. She first investigated the technique, posture and resonance of the instrument always using the Bach cello Suites as a reference. In 2014, as she was still looking for more answers in the Suites, Marianne moved to Berlin to work full time on her project. Once in Berlin, she first worked with makers of baroque instruments, had encounters with baroque specialists, made research in many libraries including the research institut for musicology at the Berlin Philhamonie and collected a lot of historical documents. She recorded the suites with the instruments she used during her research. This album, and the corresponding project, is truly groundbreaking.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=LDV14036&medium=phy#,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Baroque Era,Italy,2018 Leonardo Series by Urania Records,2018 Leonardo Series by Urania Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He is joined by the extraordinary French flute ensemble Trio d’Argent, to give new life to neglected classical masterpieces by Eugène Walckiers (1793-1866): Grand Concert Quartet in F # min Op.46 and Friedrich Kuhlau (1786-1832): Grand Quartet in mi min Op.103. For several years they had been trying to record these two magnificent quartets for flutes by Freidrich Kuhlau and Eugène Walckiers. Finally their busy schedules allowed them to work with one another and record these virtuoso quartets. The result is a musical experience of great intensity and an unprecedented feast not to be missed. The originality of this recording also comes from the choice of having interpreted these quartets with four wooden flutes (Abel flutes). The wood allows each one of the four virtuosos to get closer to the sounds of the instruments of the time and to match the sonority and articulation in a miraculous manner. This release is chamber music elegance and virtuosity of the highest order.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=jbcc273&medium=phy#,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Chamber Music,Mexico,UDC media,UDC media,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Resident composer of the Simon Bolivar Orchestra, Dudamel and other leading conductors and soloists champion his refined and unique components, with Two Seasons of the Caribbean Tropics, the Boston Music Intelligencer, remarked “one can add the name of Paul Desenne (1959-) to the list of Latino composers such as Ginastera, Piazzola, and Golijov that entertainingly straddle hot and cold blooded miens of New Spain and Old Europe. Certainly not all composers of weather programmed works allude to Vivaldi’s Seasons, but this one surely did in something of an apotheosis of the Venetian’s rhetoric.” “The rainy season…can be extremely annoying…and the dry season can be just as devastating, when nature’s territory shrinks in agony,” Desenne tell us. His “injection of Caribbean music and intense rhythmic treatment” make for a spicy cauldron where Vivaldi bubbles up one minute and double troubles of Gottschalk and Piazzola the next. Unitas Ensemble founder, Lina Gonzalez presided over this Ivesian plum pudding with as much geniality as PDQ Bach. But very much her own were lightning changes of tempo, meter and affect all cued and shaped to a fare-the-well. Fronted by violinist Saul Bitran’s fabulously over-the-top concerto expressiveness, the eager and responsive players give us half an hour of Vivaldi Furioso and Tremolo Agitato in a facetious but affectionate “Venetian Jam session.” The release includes the most idiomatic and original version of Piazzolla’s Cuatro Estaciones Porteñas (The Four Seasons of Buenos Aires) with Unitas and Grammy Award Winner Cuarteto Latinoamericano.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=jbcc279&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Orchestral,Mexico,UDC media,UDC media,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2018,WGO,Wergo,WER73612,4010228736120,Michael Blake,The Philosophy of Composition - Works for Violoncello & Piano,Friedrich Gauwerky; Daan Vandewalle,1,CD,14.81,22.99,"Michael Blake is South African composition’s most important link to the American and British experimental traditions of the second half of the 20th century. It is a connection that derives as much from the composer’s temperament and aesthetic sensibility, as from more conscious decisions relating to the socio-political positioning of composition. As regards the former, Blake’s affinity with composers like Charles Ives and John Cage precedes his mature engagements with these composers through an embrace of certain qualities of openness relating to musical structure and material that can be heard throughout the works recorded on this album. Blake’s “song without words” demonstrates deconstruction, playfulness, irregularity, irony and a postmodern referential sensibility. Apart from “song without words,” which was written in 1972, the seven other works recorded on this album date from between 2008 and 2016, a period of mature compositional activity bookended by the composer’s retirement to the village of Hout Bay near Cape Town late in 2008, and relocation to France in 2015.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=WER73612&medium=phy#,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Chamber Music,Austria,2018 Wergo,2018 Wergo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the liner notes, Rainer Nonnenmann describes an inventive musical cosmos, whose unity develops only of alleged contradictions: “Lisa Streich’s music has a captivating beauty, at once earnest and playful, strong and meaningful, physical, cruel and tender. It gives us much to feel and think about. It is multi-voiced, ambivalent, incongruous, poetic and profane, as fraught with contradictions as is life itself. It is music of this world, and yet it is not.” To create a wide musical spectrum, the Swedish composer uses a variety of instrumentation: raging from duo, over ensemble and choir, to orchestra. The five pieces have been especially recorded for this album by ensemble recherche, hand werk and UT insieme vocale-consonante, among others. Different production conditions also correspond to the musical diversity: While three of the album's compositions were recorded at regular venues, the recordings of the vocal works took place in the Cologne Cathedral and the Roman church of Santa Maria in Campitelli.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=WER64252&medium=phy#,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Contemporary Era,Germany,2018 Wergo,2018 Wergo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
