Bach's concertos or his other works are vivid examples of this. When we talk about new versions created by the composers themselves, it is not just that doppelgangers that are born. I think that the composer, sometimes consciously, sometimes intuitively, felt that in this music there is potential, which in the new version gives this creation a new life. All the works recorded on this album certainly belong to this category." Michael Vaiman was born in Ukraine. After graduating from the distinguished Stolyarsky School of Music in his hometown, he studied at the Tchaikovsky Conservatory of Music in Moscow under legendary violinist David Oistrakh and Semyon Snitkovsky. Especially noteworthy is the unusual range of his repertoire, which includes all violin sonatas by Beethoven, Brahms, Prokofiev, Franck, and Schumann and also all of Schubert's and Shostakovich's compositions for violin and orchestra.

Contemporary music is an essential part of her work: she has premiered over 50 works and two, soon three concertos. Like contemporary music sometimes does, the organ works of J. S. Bach felt very modern to the people of his time. Bach's works are still fresh and inspiring as the program of this album proves. "Bach on Porthan Organ" continues Susanne Kujala's series of introducing Finland's organs to a larger audience. Her debut release "Organ Triptychon" was recorded on three significant instruments of Helsinki. This new album features the Porthan Organ of St. Lawrence Church in Janakkala. The series is to be continued with her upcoming release "Finnish Organ Music of the 21th Century", which has been recorded already on the organs of Turku Cathedral, Helsinki Kallio and St. Paul's Church. Organ builder Martti Porthan made the organ building style of the German Baroque alive in Finland. All main features of the Porthan organ of St. Lawrence in Janakkala are based on the famous Huß Schnitger organ of Ss. Cosmae et Damiani in Stade.

When a 19-year-old Dhafer Youssef discovered Indian music in Vienna, where he was studying classical music, it had the effect of a bewildering epiphany on him. Hindu sonorities struck a deep chord within Dhafer's musical soul - thirty years later, the Tunisian composer reminisces: "I was both filled with wonder as well as deeply convinced that one day I would be performing alongside the most legendary players of Indian music." From then on, Dhafer Youssef lived and breathed Indian music. Nine records later, the travelling musician who contributed to bring oud into jazz music had fulfilled his dream of playing Indian music and had invited percussionist Zakir Hussain on stage with him for a few shows while touring France. The match was made in heaven but a touch of color was still missing - that of a wind instrument. Dhafer Youssef then brought along another "soulmate," Turkish clarinettist Husnu Selenderici. The trio tested live the living matter that eventually gave shape to the twelve tracks of Sounds of Mirrors. The recording started in Mumbai then carried on in Instanbul where Eivin Aarset, the Norwegian jazz guitarist with an ethereal style, joined the one-of-a-kind adventure. The record, which was originally meant to be a tribute to Zakir Hussain and tabla then took an unexpected turn. The mixing was conducted in the Swedish Nilento Studio, in Göteborg, and lends the album its light, cohesive quality. Dhafer Youssef and his enthralling, endless capacity for renewal offers the listener a golden opportunity to bear witness to new encounters, like so many musical colors that had never been imagined before. The art of sharing is one of fine alchemy.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=ATP1038315&medium=phy,30 World/Int'l.,World,World|Africa,EU,Dhafer Youssef,Dhafer Youssef,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

What appears, at first sight, to be a contrast is in fact a logical continuation of her extensive discography, even an enhancement: whilst in her previous releases, Pietsch demonstrated her expressive range and intensive approach both as a brilliant soloist and as an eloquent chamber musician, she now faces the greatest possible reduction, namely a solo recital. This limitation demands incredible presence, power and intensity, for which Franziska Pietsch is predestined. From isolation, she draws depth and grounding; ""less"" becomes ""more""; soleness transforms into greatness. For her solo recital, she has put together an individual choice of compositions which have accompanied her from an early age and which, for her, represent significant personal and artistic experiences. Prokofiev, to whose works she feels a particular affinity, is also featured here. Once again, Franziska Pietsch displays a compelling combination of technique and interpretation: her irrepressible creative force penetrates all technical challenges, never losing sight of her interpretation, every note forming part of her reading - a deeply personal recording of the solo sonatas by Bartók, Ysaÿe and Prokofiev. Bartók's solo sonata, written for Yehudi Menuhin in 1944, and the six sonatas Op. 27 by Ysaÿe are amongst the most prominent twentieth century compositions for violin. Bach, the great paragon, is present in all these works. From Ysaÿe's cycle, Pietsch has chosen the particularly striking Sonatas Nos 2 and 3 which are dedicated respectively to the violinists Jacques Thibaud and George Enescu.

That musical jack-of-all-trades, Sergei Koussevitsky, Director of Music with the Boston Symphony Orchestra for twenty-five years, commissions the orchestration of two world-famous works: Pictures at an Exhibition by Modest Mussorgsky and the Études-Tableaux by Sergey Rachmaninoff. And who does Koussevitsky choose for this task? Why, none other than the two great composers Maurice Ravel and Ottorino Respighi. Their orchestrations lay the foundations for numerous other arrangements of those works. More than 80 years later, Dirk Mommertz, a member of and pianist with the Fauré Quartett, has arranged both of these works anew - this time for piano quartet. "A chamber-music ensemble, with piano and strings, is ideally suited to present the entire tonal spectrum," explains Dirk Mommertz. Violinist Erika Geldsetzer, violist Sascha Frömbling, cellist Konstantin Heidrich and Mommertz at the piano have been an entity for over 25 years now and are justifiably acknowledged as one of the most influential piano quartets in the world. They are renowned for branching out into new territory; they are not afraid of leaving the well-trodden path, so it comes as no surprise that the Fauré Quartett have recorded for the first time their own arrange-ments of these works on one album. The mesh of relationships which binds Mussorgsky's composition of 1874 and Rachmaninoff's of 1911-1918 with Koussevitsky's commissions to Ravel and Respighi, now ends 150 years later with the Fauré Quartett in the 21st century.",https://youtu.be/ISF08takDpE,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=0301119BC&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Germany,2018 Edel Germany GmbH,2018 Edel Germany GmbH,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

According to Claire Huangci, in recent years she has felt increasingly drawn to complete cycles of works ""in order to better understand the longer bows in a composer's life." This is particularly interesting for Rachmaninoff and his 24 Préludes, as they were created over 18 years. In 1892 Rachmaninoff laid the foundation stone with the Prélude in C sharp minor op. 3 No. 2, which quickly developed into one of his most famous works. ""If we are to recognize the psychology of Preludes, let it be understood that his function is not to express a mood, but to bring it about."" Applied to Rachmaninoff's Preludes as a whole, this statement illustrates Rachmaninoff's attempt to embrace a variety of emotions. The 10 Préludes op. 23 from 1903 and the 13 Préludes op. 32 from 1910 complete the double dozen and make the Russian composer's compositional development clear: ""One can hear the transition. Rachmaninoff's music became more complex, more contrapuntal; it became harmonically interesting and exciting.""

There were work songs, narrative ballads and, obviously, music for dancing. Over the centuries a not always easy coexistence between religion and folk culture developed, with hymns being adapted to a folk-music aesthetic while popular traditions were given a Christian veneer. An example of the latter is the rich store of 'Staffan ballads', springing from a pre-Christian horse cult but given a new slant as its focus shifted to St. Stephen - the first Christian martyr. Gunnar Idenstam and S:t Jacobs Chamber Choir have performed their Folkjul concerts more or less every year since 2002. The concept stem from a rich interplay between 'folk culture' and 'high culture' and in Idenstam's arrangements a newly composed halling or polska entwines itself round the old Christmas melodies.

At the end of Matthias Claudius's poem, which Schubert had set as a 20-year-old in 1817, Death cradles the Maiden in his bony embrace. And her fear, in the first verse, of encountering his tomb-cold touch is mirrored by his desire for her in the second. In Schubert's lifetime, death was a constant presence in everyday life and even a young person like himself would have encountered it at close quarters - in fact, his own mother had passed away when he was only 15. When Schubert returns to the song in 1824 and starts work on the string quartet, death has nevertheless grown even more real: in the meantime he has become acquainted with pain and disease during the bouts of the syphilis that he knows will kill him. He turns the song into a set of variations, preceding it with a ferocious Allegro, and following it with a Scherzo and a Finale that have been described as 'the dance of the demon fiddler' and 'a dance with death'. The acclaimed Chiaroscuro Quartet performs the work on gut strings, which brings out the vulnerability and desperation even further. The players then let us down gently with the youthful String Quartet No.?9 in G minor, a work in which the minor key offers Schubert the opportunity to play with light and shadows, rather than full-scale drama.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=BIS-2268&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Chamber Music,EU,2018 Deutschlandradio/BIS Records AB,2018 Deutschlandradio/BIS Records AB,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bach, Jörgen van Rijen on his first recording for BIS Records brings together music by the two composers. It's a relationship which has several aspects. First, Pärt has readily admitted to his love for the work of Bach, referring to it in titles such as Collage über BACH, but also by using the motif BACH (B flat-A-C-B). In addition, both composers share a fascination for religion, while at the same time composing music that is almost mathematically constructed, possessing an underlying order that forms the basis of its timelessness. In collaboration with the composer, van Rijen has adapted four works by Pärt for the trombone, including the celebrated piece Fratres, which exists in numerous versions, as well as the two religiously themed An den Wassern zu Babel ... and Vater unser. Pärt's open-minded attitude to adaptations of his works is also something he has in common with Bach, who regularly reused his own compositions, rearranging them for new occasions. Bach also 'borrowed' from other composers, and the three concertos heard here are all arrangements for solo organ of works by Italian composers, which van Rijen in his turn has arranged for trombone and strings.

All four seem to be haunted by an even deeper past: Bent Sørensen's Minnelieder is the composer's third version of a work originally sparked-off by a book about the 14th century, while Toshio Hosokawa's Drawing, from a decade later, was inspired by the very start of life. Kristin Norderval's Chapel Meditation began its existence as an improvisation, but looks back to music from centuries earlier, while the most recent work, Mantra by Ellen Lindquist, also mines a venerable musical tradition, that of the age-old Indonesian gamelan orchestra that for over 100 years has had an influence on Western composers such as Debussy, Britten, Steve Reich et al.

Already in his lifetime some of his most popular songs appeared with simplified guitar accompaniment, marketed by music publishers wanting to exploit the growing market for domestic music-making. Schubert himself composed very little for the instrument, and there are doubts regarding Schubert's own skills on the instrument. Nevertheless it is well known that the guitar was in fashion with the middle-class Viennese among which Schubert and his circle of friends moved. In his notes, Kellermann argues that elements of the light, melody-driven and carefree musical style favoured in that environment and present in stylized form in much of Schubert's music is the very aspect that makes it so inviting to play on the guitar. DuoKeMi was formed by Kellermann and Daniel Migdal in 2006, and the two are constantly aiming to expand the repertoire for their combination of instruments. This has resulted in a number of commissions as well as new transcriptions, often by Kellermann himself as in the case of the much-loved Arpeggione Sonata recorded here.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=BIS-2375&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Chamber Music,EU,"2018 BIS Records AB, Sweden","2018 BIS Records AB, Sweden",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The first of these ranks as a pioneering work of the early 20th century - and the third, regarded as a key work of 20th-century music due to its extraordinary rhythmic and tonal structures, can both be experienced on this new release from BR-KLASSIK - in live recordings with the Symphonieorchester des Bayerischen Rundfunks under its chief conductor Mariss Jansons, and in masterly interpretations. Diaghilev, a formative figure in 20th-century ballet, had founded the Ballets Russes ensemble in 1909 in Paris, where it first performed before moving to Monte Carlo in 1911. The first performance of Stravinsky's ""Firebird"" took place on June 25, 1910 at the Paris Opera House, and ""Le sacre du printemps"" premiered on May 29, 1913 in the newly-built Théâtre des Champs-Élysées - a day that went down in history as one of the great artistic scandals of the 20th century. The furious protests from the Parisian public combined with the highly negative critical reviews all ended up making Stravinsky famous. His truly futuristic music has now established itself internationally and is an integral part of concert programs, and one can still hear why it so enraged audiences over 100 years ago.

The very recent reconstruction/completion of the Mass by Clemens Kemme in the spring of 2018 confines itself to the original sources, avoiding any arbitrary additions. The work was recorded in this critically acclaimed version for the Bayerischer Rundfunk during the summer of 2018, and conducted by Howard Arman. This album is thus the first recording of the definitive version of this new and intelligently edited reconstruction of Mozart's Mass in C minor. An introduction to the work is also included, enabling this masterpiece to be approached from new perspectives. In Vienna in the summer of 1782, Mozart started writing a new Mass despite having apparently received no commission to do so. On August 4, 1782 he married Constanze Mozart, and from his correspondence it appears that he had made himself a promise to "have a newly-composed mass performed in Salzburg if he brought her there as his wife." The work may have been performed on October 26, 1783 in St. Peter's Church in Salzburg, with Constanze as the soprano soloist; concrete evidence of such a performance is however lacking. Nevertheless, the Mass can probably be seen as a kind of votive offering for Constanze. The fact that the work was not completed may be due to the church music reforms implemented by the Emperor Joseph II, who preferred sacred music to be performed on a smaller scale. In 1785, Mozart eventually reworked the "Kyrie"" and ""Gloria"" from the mass for his cantata Davide penitente.",https://youtu.be/9ATU49P5ThY,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=BRK900917&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Classical Era,Germany,BRmedia Service GmbH,BRmedia Service GmbH,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bach (who regarded him particularly highly, punning on their two surnames declaring Krebs 'was the only crayfish in his stream') and a supremely talented inheritor of the composer-organist tradition of the Northern European Baroque. As a member of the last generation of these musicians, he lived in a time of marked shifts in taste, during the rise of the empfindsamer (sensitive) style, with its preference for balance and grace over the high baroque's interwoven contrapuntal lines and chromatic harmony. For this reason his genius met with little acceptance during his long career, yet despite never securing a prestigious position and salary and never being commissioned to write he composed a significant body of music, particularly for the organ at which he excelled, his skill almost rivalling that of his mentor, J.S. Bach. Today, long after the stylistic trends of his day have faded, Krebs is appreciated for his exceptionally refined music. For the organ this includes a variety of pieces in several improvisatory and contrapuntal forms, including a great many chorale settings. Thirteen of these come from his Clavier-Übung (keyboard method), the first volume of which was composed for the organ. Manuel Tomadin has selected three instruments of the Northern European Baroque School, lesser-known than others in their native Germany and Holland and yet of very high quality, plus a modern instrument for the recording of the Clavier-Übung. The latter, built in 2007 by the Giovanni Pradella Workshop in the Italian alpine province of Sondrio, is nevertheless constructed according to ancient techniques in handcrafted hardwood and painstakingly cast and rolled pipes.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=BRI95363&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Solo Instrumental,Germany,2018 Brilliant Classics,2018 Brilliant Classics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He describes it as a 'fascinating challenge' to a take concertos originally written by the outstanding composers of the Baroque era for the most prominent treble instruments of their day, the recorder and the violin. The album accordingly begins with a violin concerto by Vivaldi, with further transcriptions of violinistic showpieces by Corelli and Roberto Valentino. Works originally written for wind instruments include the famous Adagio composed by Marcello as part of his D minor Oboe Concerto, a sinfonia by Alessandro Scarlatti and a sonata by Telemann. The popular appeal of the compilation is enhanced by the inclusion of Albinoni's Adagio, now in trumpet and organ guise, and a chaconne by Pachelbel. The E flat Sonata for transverse flute by Bach is a particular high-point, complemented by two of his grandest works for solo organ, the D major Prelude and Fugue BWV532 with its spectacular closing pedal cadenza, and the Gothic splendor of the G minor Fantasy and Fugue. The E flat Concertino by Albrechtsberger is a thrilling example of late-Baroque trumpet writing, and the collection moves forward chronologically with the F minor Organ Sonata of Mendelssohn. The sonata is complemented here by several world premiere recordings of pieces written for the distinctive combination of trumpet and organ. Appassionata is a Beethoven-inspired sonata by the Lithuanian composer Juraj Filas, and the Adagio by the same composer is a follow-up work commissioned by Otto Sauter. The Dutch composer and conductor Jan Koetsier likewise wrote his Echo Concerto for Sauter, who gave the first performance in 1991.

It was writing for this combination of instruments in the unlikely context of the slow movement of his Second Piano Concerto that seems finally to have convinced Tchaikovsky he could turn to the genre of piano trio proper and overcome his previous antipathy to it. In fact, following the death of the pianist Nikolai Rubinstein in March 1881, the Piano Trio was composed within less than a year, and with unusual fluency. Its unconventional format - a sonata-form movement followed by an extended theme and variations - takes as its model Beethoven's final sonata Op.111. The emotional intensity of the first movement is dispelled by the lighter mood of the second, which may represent personal memories of Rubinstein, including visiting an amusement park and attending a ball, and the charmingly lopsided theme is apparently based on a folk melody he had heard in Rubinstein's company. On the day of Tchaikovsky's death in October 1893, Rachmaninoff began work on a Trio élégiaque in D minor in his memory. He later composed a much more extended trio in homage to Tchaikovsky's example, but this single movement is no less impassioned and accomplished in its way. Both trios have attracted countless great interpreters down the decades, to whose number may now be added the Russian pairing of Dmitri Makhtin and Alexander Kniazev, with the Hungarian pianist Klára Würtz, who has made many admired recordings for Brilliant Classics.

Nuits d'été à Pausillippe is an album of ariettas, romanzas, notturnos and duettinos published in 1836. The texts speak of four seasons and three cities, but it's Naples that takes the lead role: Donizetti lived and worked in the city between 1822 and 1838. Mostly authored by local poets, the texts are essentially simple portraits of things Italian: the boatman, the breath of the beloved, and the tower of Biasone (which ends with one of Donizetti's most disarming tunes). Le crépuscule (Twilight), however, sets verses by Victor Hugo as a romanza describing the new dawn, and continues with the lover's door that is closed.

Born in Rome to a professional jazz-musician father, Gangi graduated from the city's Accademia della Santa Cecilia and soon followed in his father's footsteps as both an orchestral bassist (with the local radio orchestra) and a guitarist. This latter career took off in the 50s: Gangi gave several important first performances of concertos by the likes of Petrassi and even Giuliani. A distinguished discography bears testament to a supremely fluent technician whose gifts as a shaper of melody are reflected in these brief songs for guitar on this album. According to the guitarist Alessandro Minci, these songs explore the most intimate and sensitive side of Gangi's output for the guitar, combining jazz, classical and popular idioms in an entirely personal voice and one which speaks with the eclectic, cosmopolitan spirit of his age. The album thus makes an essential complement to the Brilliant Classics issue of the 22 Studies drawn from the third volume of Gangi's influential guitar method. Several of them evoke natural landscapes; others cast wistful glances back at childhood, at the Baroque heritage of his instrument, and at past loves and passions.

Little is known about Meda other than the scant details printed on the title page of the edition of these motets, printed in 1691: her name; her title: donna (indicating her position as professa in a Benedictine convent); and the name of the monastery where she lived: San Martino del Leano, in Pavia. She probably took holy orders as a teenager, and she was followed by several other members of her family. These motets are sacred but not designed for liturgical use, setting first-person texts (possibly by Meda herself) on themes such as the renunciation of worldly pleasures, an ardent love for Jesus the bridegroom, and requests for intercession by Mary, the Queen of Heaven. The wide range of the vocal lines, as well as the difficulty of the vocal and instrumental parts, indicate that both singers and instrumentalists in Meda's convent were highly skilled. Although the scores can be performed by a mixed voice ensemble, this recording restores them to the kind of performance that would have been heard in the convent of San Martino del Leano, with a light instrumental ensemble accompanying an all-female choir. The album is an absorbing sequel to Capella Artemisia's debut on Brilliant Classics with 'Weep and Rejoice,' also reviving little-known Italian 17th- and 18th- century composers.

Through the course of the 19th century the organ was also evolving, transcending the image of an exclusively liturgical instrument and gaining ground - and indeed range of tone-colors - in concertante roles. Another 19th-century case in point was Eugène Jancourt, the bassoon virtuoso and composer, who brought about important changes in his instrument in order to extend its expressive potential. A longstanding performer and teacher at the Paris Conservatoire, he wrote a Concertino which transfers well to this combination of bassoon and organ, as does a Verdian rarity, discovered as recently as 2001, the youthful Capriccio. A contemporary of Jancourt's was the French oboist, composer and conductor Théodore Lalliet, who played solo oboe in the orchestra of the Paris Opera. His Op.22 Terzetto was conceived as a piano trio, but the fluid instrumental dialogue gains an attractive mellifluousness in this combination of oboe, bassoon and organ. Ehestandsgeplauder (Wedding Chatter) by Carl Friedemann and Amourette faunienne by Heinrich Molbe are lighter occasional pieces. Verdi's Capriccio is complemented here by the inclusion of the Fantasie et Variations for oboe on themes of Il Corsaro. Its composer, Stanislas Verroust, studied music in Paris, where he then made a name for himself as an oboist and violinist as well as composing for the oboe and devoting time to teaching. This combination of repertoire is unrivalled in the catalogue.

Left naked in its primeval state, the voice leads each composer to rediscover his personal voice, unfettered by convention. Six of the eight composers represented here were born within the same five years, from 1926 (Kurtág and Feldman) to 1931 (Bussotti, Kagel), in 1929 Pousseur, in 1930 De Pablo. Andriessen was born slightly after in 1939 whilst only Macmillan (b.1959) belongs to the following generation. Bold simplicity is the keynote of Feldman's brief setting of Rilke, Only: purely diatonic across its two minute span, whereas Henri Pousseur's equally concise tribute to Baudelaire uses a 12-tone technique to create the illusion of diatonicism. In the hands of Luis de Pablo, Góngora's evocation of a flight of storks creating patterns in the sky, is suggested by melismatic use of the voice, with arpeggios and filigree in quasi-instrumental notation, with arabesque-like writing which hints at distant Arabic hues of flamenco. In Einige Sätze aus den Sudelbüchern Georg Christoph Lichtenbergs, György Kurtág set the caustic aphorisms of a18th-century German physicist and writer with lightning flashes of insight and expression. By contrast, A Song of the Sea by Louis Andriessen requires the singer to sit (in performance) with a doll on her lap as she tells a sad little story with a simplicity redolent of folksong. Bussotti and Kagel both made far more thoroughgoing exploration of vocal technique in the Lettura di Braibanti and The Tower of Babel respectively. Lorna Windsor closes her recital with the most extended work on the album: in angustiis II, a lament by James Macmillan which presents a grief-stricken image of humanity crying out to God.

This edition provides a cross-section of Hummel's excellent, prolific and unjustly neglected output, with a large section of solo piano music including the complete sonatas and etudes and a rich selection of chamber music featuring violin, viola, cello, flute, and guitar with piano, as well as larger ensembles from piano trios to septets. Though not a symphonist (perhaps not wishing to compete in that arena with the undoubted genius of his contemporary Beethoven), Hummel had great skill with the orchestra, as this set proves with his many concertante works, all rivalling the well-known Trumpet Concerto, among them concertos for piano, piano and violin, bassoon, mandolin, violin (unfinished, completed by conductor-composer Gregory Rose) and the Introduction, Theme and Variations Op.102 for oboe and orchestra. Haydn's recommendation of Hummel for the post of Konzertmeister at the court of Prince Esterhazy was the beginning of eight turbulent years at Eisenstadt. Fiercely independent, Hummel found fitting in with the manners and politics of the court difficult, and yet this was a very productive time. All his sacred music - represented on this set by a Te Deum, a Solemn Mass, the offertory Alma Virgo and the oratorio Der Durchzug durchs rote Meer for soloists, choir and orchestra - and several dramatic works including the opera Mathilde von Guise were composed during this period.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=BRI95792&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Germany,2018 Brilliant Classics,2018 Brilliant Classics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2018,Brilliant Classics,BRI95797,5028421957975,Jose Arriola ,Arriola: Orchestral Music,Real Filharmonia de Galicia,2,CD,13.25,20.99,"These are the first-ever recordings of music composed by José (Pepito) Arriola, whose works are virtually unknown. Born in Betanzos in the northern Spanish region of Galicia in 1895, Arriola was a celebrated child prodigy known at the time as a 'Galician Mozart', who dazzled audiences across Europe and American with his piano-playing. Most of Arriola's work was lost when his home in Berlin was destroyed during the Second World War. The manuscripts for the three concertos and two song-cycles presented here were discovered just a few years ago, and mysteriously vanished almost as soon as they had been photocopied for dissemination. They were composed in the final decade of Arriola's life: in 1946 he settled in Barcelona, where he lived quietly until his death in 1954. Arriola's music belongs to the second golden age of Spanish music, that of Albéniz, Granados, Turina and Falla (and, a little later, Joaquín Rodrigo), flavoured by nationalism and the rich Spanish folk tradition, along with a verismo that concerned itself with the ordinary people of Spain and their suffering (as mirrored in Carmen, or Candela in El amor brujo). Yet in common with other post-Romantic composers, Arriola sought out a world of vanished beauty, experimenting with color, texture, unusual tonal combinations and harmony full of color, sensuality and emotion. As a student in Leipzig, Arriola had been taught by Richard Strauss, and his teacher's influence may be heard to positive effect in both the soaring vocal lines of the Tres textos cervantinos and the transplanted Classical idiom of the Horn Concerto. The piano-writing in the Concertino and Divertimento concertante is more compact and Stravinskian, while two songs from the cycle of Seis poesías de Antonio Machado disclose yet another, more impassioned facet of Arriola's style.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=BRI95797&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Germany,2018 Brilliant Classics,2018 Brilliant Classics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He lived, worked and died in Rotterdam, a city that has always been well-placed to capitalize on international commercial and cultural links to support a distinguished history of music publishing. The contents of Smout's collection, which found its way into the Thysius library in Leiden, embraces musical forms amongst the most popular of the late-Renaissance and early-Baroque periods: songs, branles, galliards and allemandes. There is also a bergamasque (a shepherd's song) which, in its extreme simplicity, has been taken by the Italian musicians of the Pacoloni Ensemble as an opportunity for improvisation and variation. The original authors have nearly all been lost in the mists of time, except for Smout's transcription of ´Can she excuse´, a song by John Dowland. Up to four lutes are used, and several tracks are enhanced by percussion which would have lent color and rhythmic strength to this music played in its own time: the manuscript as a whole has been freshly edited, and taken as the basis for richly textured and melodically elaborated performances which do not confine themselves to the literal indications of the tablature. Led by their founder-director Roberto Cascio, the musicians of the Pacoloni Ensemble have been performing together for two decades.

The Piano Trio No. 2 is lengthier than its predecessor and very ambitious both in its tonal register and execution. The formal norms - sonata form, song form, scherzo, and then another sonata movement - are upheld with completeness and elegance. The piano trio had a long line of tradition going back to Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven, but the composer who set standards in the middle of the nineteenth century is particularly clearly recognizable here in a model function: Mendelssohn. Only about seven years passed between this trio and Strauss's only Piano Quartet, but in 1885 too he was still a very young composer. The quartet displays impressive advances in technique; now Strauss apparently could draw on all the compositional resources then available, and the higher virtuosic demands on the instrumentalists are also quite evident.

After all, from the beginning of his tenure there his duties had included the composition of the church music for every court religious service and for all the church feast days. Fasch had a special mission in mind when he penned his cantatas: he was very much interested in having hislisteners not remain indifferent to the texts that were sung. And so he employed all sorts of compositional tricks to capture their attention and to emphasize words of special importance to him. This procedure is impressively revealed already at the beginning of the cantata »Ich danke dem Herrn vom ganzen Herzen.« After a short instrumental introduction the opening Biblical text is presented not as usual by the choir but initially by the solo soprano. Then in the Missa in G major almost all the facets of Fasch's musical talent are shown; from arias with obbligato solo instruments to grandly dimensioned chorale fugues placing the greatest demands both on the singers and the instrumentalists, it was composed in its entirety for the entertainment and edification of his noble employer and to the glory of God.

2018,CPO,555148-2,761203514823,Toivo Kuula ,Kuula: Violin Sonatas,Nina Karmon; Oliver Triendl ,1,CD,13.25,20.99,"Although Toivo Kuula was one of the few pupils taught by Sibelius, he never really had to struggle to emerge from his teacher's shadow into his own independent light. His oeuvre focused not on symphonic music but on areas that were only of peripheral interest to Sibelius: the song with piano accompaniment, choral music, and chamber music. Kuula originally had wanted to be a violinist and continued to favor the violin even after the playing of this instrument had receded into the background and his activities as a composer had come to occupy the foreground. It is thus not surprising that works for violin and piano form the core of his chamber oeuvre and run like a red thread through his entire compositional career. The Sonata Movement of 1906 already attests to the composer's remarkable mastery in the design of musical processes. The essential difference between this piece and the Violin Sonata op. 1 composed during the following year, when Kuula was a student in Helsinki, is that in the latter work his own voice is present from the very beginning. As a press report demonstrates, its premiere at the Music Academy in Helsinki in 1907 turned out to be a great success for the composer, who was not yet twenty-four years old. The critic Karl Flodin (1858-1925) found: "The sonata is not a pupil's composition but the product of a mature, independent, and brilliant talent [...]. [It] has atmosphere, imagination, poetry, and power, with a strong expression of will."",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=555148-2&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Chamber Music,Germany,2018 cpo,2018 cpo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Danish theatrical historian Poul Hansen describes Abraham Fonseca at the end of the 19th century quite derogatively as "an immigrated Portuguese from the newly arrived banker aristocracy." Ida has three sisters and two brothers. The finance sector is by no means a big business in Copenhagen in the years following the national bankruptcy of 1813. So the Fonseca Family have to struggle to feed their children. The children grow up and must contribute to the household as soon as possible. Several of them are talented singers, and if one wants to progress as a singer in Copenhagen in the 1820s, there is one man to turn to: the choirmaster Giuseppe Siboni at the Royal Theater, which is where Ida honed her craft.

Moving from the baroque phrasing of Pietro Migali, through three different lyrical souls represented very well by Mercadante, Giordano and van Westerhout, we reach the contemporaries Cellaro, Rota, Piazzolla and Sollima; it seems to be witnessing an elevation ad astra, where the voice of the cello emerges from the hiding of its ancient and constant work of support and solid base, slowly emerges from its gravity and makes us taste the ""humanity"" of its most lyrical and unexplored accents. The program chosen by the ensemble offers the listener a masterly essay on the versatility of the cello, which is able to navigate, over a period of almost four centuries, between the instrumental and vocal repertoire, passing through the classical and popular dances. The arrangements give the compositions particular and unusual colors, due to the nature of the instrument, to which it's given the possibility to express itself simultaneously in different ways and registers, offering a complete spectrum of its expressive abilities; listening to the album, one senses that the cello gradually tries to abstract itself from the repertoire and practices so that it can freely describe and narrate itself.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=DIGR85&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Chamber Music,Italy,Digressione Music,Digressione Music,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The artists comment: "There are no such things as the two of us - two studious, open-minded young Viennese musicians who want to serve their darling Schubert with all their Four Hands in what is probably the most beautiful chamber music hall in the world, which Brahms loved so much that it later was named Brahms Hall, in the venerable house of the Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde - among the founding members were Beethoven and Schubert - on the most Viennese of all pianos, the Bösendorfer with its singing, downright Schubertian treble. Both of us had just escaped physically and spiritually sound from the turmoil of war; one thought of creating a new world of the beautiful and the good, both of us at least in music. We had a unique generation of great masters to look up to: Wilhelm Backhaus, probably the greatest of all Bösendorf players, Walter Gieseking, Edwin Fischer - we were even granted to study together in Lucerne in 1948; Paul remained connected to him throughout his life. Above all, the wonderful violin sound of the Vienna Philharmonic delighted us, and in Furtwängler the brilliant overall conception: Have you heard ""His"" Unfinished, or the Great C major symphony? Schubert's songs delighted us with the wonderful voices of Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, Irmgard Seefried, and soon also by Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau. Joseph Krips had just presented the opera with a Mozart style that was fully natural. The whole world seemed to breathe a sigh of relief (it was before the darn Iron Curtain) and Vienna was once again the capital of music. And so we played the piano with our Four Hands, above all Mozart and Schubert, as faithfully as possible to the scores of Schubert, but we were happy to incorporate temperament, feeling and inspiration into our ten fingers."",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=GRAM99175&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Piano,Austria,2018 Gramola,2018 Gramola,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All-purpose term for a person, place or thing. Sure, Christian McBride could have called his new ensemble the Christian McBride Quartet or the Christian McBride Group, or any number of other, somewhat more straitlaced variations on that basic theme. But this new chordless quartet - with trumpeter Josh Evans, saxophonist Marcus Strickland, and drummer Nasheet Waits - arrives with a bit too much grit under its fingernails to warrant a name quite that buttoned up. If there's one thing the acclaimed bassist knows, it's that when it comes to grit there's no better resource to draw from than his own hometown, Philadelphia. So, McBride turned to one of the city's most beloved colloquialisms to christen his latest project, Christian McBride's New Jawn. On the band's eponymous debut, these four stellar musicians ably walk the razor's edge between thrilling virtuosity and gut-punch instinctiveness. "I was looking for a new challenge," says McBride of the birth of the New Jawn. "I don't get the chance too often to play in a chordless group. Every major group I've been a part of for the last ten years, whether it's been with Pat Metheny or Chick Corea or my own projects, there's been nothing but chords.

After a particularly nasty fight in Brussels in July 1873 Rimbaud returned to his detested home-town of Charleville and finished off his Illuminations and "A Season in Hell." Then Rimbaud simply stopped writing poetry. He was around the age of 20. Thence begins Rimbaud's long series of wanderings which eventually prompted Verlaine to describe him as "...the man with foot-soles of wind". The road for Rimbaud was a central element in his life and writing. Forever escaping into the future the whole concept of "departure" promised new worlds for him. From London to Cologne, from Java to Cyprus, from Brussels to Aden, from Paris to Harar, all of these journeys were the source of an abundant correspondence-he may have stopped writing poetry but his letters are full of inflammable opinions and descriptive impressions. "Semelles de vent" (Wind soles) is a musical project based on the wanderings of the former poet. The work is based on collections of field recordings and compositions for instrumental ensemble. Walking is the central motif in this project; readings and extracts from his letters punctuate the music.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=CUB1414&medium=phy,05 Rock,Alternative,,,2011 Musicube,2018 Musicube,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Working as the opening act on a bill with several jazz groups, the pair played a set of spontaneous compositions based entirely on song titles that were chosen by the small but attentive audience that had braved the weather and huddled up at a Logan Square dive bar. By mashing together a variety of musical approaches that night, a vision of a small ensemble was born - one that fed on the energy of group interplay and an open-minded approach to improvisation within a broad sonic universe. Almost four years later, the group has reached a new cohesion. Bassist Kurt Schweitz joined the group after the first performance and they began working regularly in 2013, releasing a well-received self-produced live album in 2014. Trim and Drobka compose melody driven music that they have been mining from a wide range of inspirations - Ornette Coleman, Robert Wyatt, Sonny Sharrock & Jim Jarmusch to name a few. Your Miniature Motion, the group's first studio album, showcases their most developed work to date. Slowly churning rock rhythms are balanced on the edge of a cliff, whispers of erie melody are brushed on a canvas of night, and dark waves of distortion slowly effervesce towards light. Pushing the boundaries even further now, the trio effortlessly moves in and out of time, posing unanswerable questions or seeking their own haven of clarity in the sound they generate around themselves.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=CUB1810&medium=phy,02 Jazz,Jazz,,,2014 Off-Records-Musicube,2018 Off-Records-Musicube,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2018,Navona,NV6192,896931004923,Gabriela Lena Frank; Ching Chu Hu; Philip Lasser ,Minju Choi.: Boundless - American Works for Solo Piano,Minju Choi ,1,CD,11.69,17.99,"Minju Choi, a passionate performer with a love for contemporary compositions, unveils the works of three powerful composers in Boundless, her album for solo piano works. Boundless covers it all: love, the transcending of cultural boundaries, and music's ability to communicate the abstract and indescribable. The first two arrangements on the album, Pulse and Sonata Andina No. 1, speak to a topic that Choi doesn't just communicate well, but understands. Pulse is written by Ching-Chu Hu, a Chinese-American composer who has balanced his Eastern background and traditions with his Western music education. As a Korean-born American, Choi can empathize with this experience, as her own background contains a balance between identities and cultural representation. Neither identity is consumed by the other, but rather the East and West work together in a complex dance that magnifies and celebrates the other. The compositions extend even beyond the East-West dichotomy and plunge south, to the rhythms and strains of South America in Gabriela Lena Frank's Sonata Andina, which showcases the styles of Peru and Bolivia among other nations. Sonata for Piano Les Hiboux Blancs (The White Owls) takes on a different challenge. The composer, American-born and French-rooted Philip Lasser, expressed his view of writing in the abstract language of music -- a language communicating that which cannot be expressed in spoken word. Choi takes the varying tempos and feelings within the piece and puts them through the exhilarating paces of her fingers across the ivories. Choi has been a champion of contemporary composers throughout her career, and her debut album demonstrates this championship while also celebrating the many cultures and customs that make up American music. Boundless proves that there are no boundaries -- cultural, energetic, or dynamic.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TwVQMLG5fA&feature=youtu.be,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=NV6192&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Piano,,,2018 Navona Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Founded by Nagy in 2009, Les Délices has established a reputation for their unique programs that are "thematically concise, richly expressive, and featuring composers few people have heard of." The New York Times added, "Concerts and recordings by Les Délices are journeys of discovery." Songs Without Words, Les Délices' second release on Navona Records, was initially inspired by the artists' desire to recover a lost repertory. While Baroque woodwinds were invented in the 1660s and 70s, no published solo music exists for them prior to 1700. The initial question that Songs Without Words sought to answer was, "What do you suppose oboists and flutists had been playing during those 30-plus years?" Motivated by the sensuous sounds and rhythms of the French language, and enabled by advances in instrument building, 17th century woodwind players adapted vocal airs - complete with rich and complex ornamentation - as a source of solo repertoire. While recording Songs Without Words initially presented an opportunity to discover and present that lost practice, as a 21st-century musician, Nagy chose to expand her own repertoire with 20th Century with jazz standards and pop tunes - from artists as diverse as Lennon and McCartney, Patsy Cline and Willie Nelson, Edith Piaf and Erroll Garner - arranged for and improvised by the ensemble. The French airs on the album are by some of the greatest writers of the 17th century: Michel Lambert, Jean-Baptiste de Bousset, and Jean-Philippe Rameau. Programming jazz standards and pop songs on Baroque instruments might seem a risky proposition. In the hands of Les Délices, however, the performances are soulful and compelling. The interweaving of these tunes with French Baroque airs allows one to hear all of the music differently, in a work that is truly timeless.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbaHkf8LqcM&feature=youtu.be,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=NV6195&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Baroque Era,,,2018 Navona Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Phoenix Ensemble now looks back on almost three decades of being a fixture in the national chamber music scene, focusing on performances and recordings of 20th- and 21st-century music. Indeed, it may be this particular specialization in complex musical structures that allows the musicians to explore Brahms' late quintet with the previously unheard thoroughness and careful reconnaissance displayed on this album. Strikingly, both faster movements in the work - the opening "I. Allegro" and the closing "IV. Con moto" - are examined more slowly, with deep profundity. Contrary to what one may expect, the work is enriched by reining in the tempo, enlarging the underlying thought process of Brahms' compositional technique as if viewed through a magnifying glass. But there's yet another artistic merit to this measure - unifying all four movements of Brahms' quintet in terms of speed also makes them fit perfectly with the otherwise vastly different Clarinet Quintet (2007) by Elliott Carter, a work that consists of movements which blend into one another. The ensemble's previously restrained rhythmic energy is fully unleashed in this structurally dense contemporary composition, culminating in an enigmatic finale. In between, the listener finds the most delightful intermezzo in Carter's standalone piece Esprit Rude/Esprit Doux (1985), in itself, as the title suggests, a work of contrasts, thus bridging the gap between the centuries. But the work, and indeed this album, accomplishes more than that. In fact, with Phoenix Ensemble's two-fold skill of navigating of dissimilar musical languages, yet finding the common denominator between them, this record might just open up the eyes of Brahms lovers to the music by Carter - and vice versa.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF5WrDlPanE&feature=youtu.be,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=NV6193&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical,,,2018 Navona Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2018,Navona,NV6196,896931004961,Elizabeth Vercoe ,Vercoe: Butterfly Effects & Other Works,Peter H. Bloom; Mary Jane Rupert; D'Anna Fortunato; Patricia McCarty; Ellen Weckler; Cheryl Cobb; Randall Hodgkinson; Dean Anderson; Emily Dickinson,1,CD,11.69,17.99,"Butterfly Effects and Other Works contains four pieces of music, each with its own personality. Vercoe composed Butterfly Effects using evocative melodies reminiscent of a butterfly in flight. The mood of each of the seven movements, set by the interplay of harp and flute (piccolo, bass, alto, or concert flute), is at times somber and reflective, and at other times bluesy and brilliant. Vercoe experiments with various techniques, sometimes with soaring melodies and trills in the flute, and at other times with more primal, percussive sounds such as beat boxing and key slaps. This is my letter to the World is composed of six songs inspired by the poetry of Emily Dickinson. Written for mezzo-soprano, flute, and piano, Vercoe builds on Dickinson's words with music that enhances the mood of the poetry. For example, in ""Snow,"" a rain stick spills slowly, recreating the sound of the falling snow. and in ""A Spider sewed at Night,"" the soft piano and use of finger cymbals evoke the quiet yet complex and introspective tone of Dickinson's famous writing style. The third piece, Elegy, is a short, dramatic piece for viola and piano that is alternately forceful and quietly introspective. The music becomes increasingly tonal as the viola eloquently asserts its voice in a short cadenza and pairs with the piano to express various reactions to loss, moving from anger to sorrow, and at last, to resignation. Finally, the fourth work, Herstory I, sets to music the poetry of women writers -- this time with piano, soprano, and vibraphone. Here Vercoe draws on the texts of four contemporary female poets: Anne Sexton, Adrienne Rich, Sylvia Plath, and Pam White. Recorded for broadcast at the WGBH-FM studios in Allston MA, the work is enriched by the energy of the live performance. Unifying the album with this final piece, Vercoe shows the true breadth and depth of her abilities as a composer.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbVJlHMRRbM&feature=youtu.be,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=NV6196&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Contemporary Era,,,2018 Navona Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With the melodic, songlike phrases that highlight each instrument equally, one can hear the joy emanating from every performer. Each piece moves through syncopated rhythms that add lift and airiness without feeling contrived. Inspired by international folk dances, where uneven rhythms are a natural element, Livingston's compositions create a sense of energy as each measure leaps from its final beat to the first beat of the next. Gentle Winds, the title track featuring flute, oboe, clarinet, and horn, opens the album with a pleasant, smooth sound through which one can almost picture meadow-grass gently swaying in a summer breeze. In The Old Man is Dancing, the flute, clarinet, and oboe effortlessly hand the main theme back and forth, as if taking turns on the dance floor. Call to the Mountains reflects the influence of classic Western film scores, with the flute, clarinet, oboe, and bassoon responding to the rich call of the horn. Quiet Summer Night for string quartet and clarinet follows a similar structure to The Old Man is Dancing, passing the melody through the quartet to the second violin and viola -- instruments often delegated to less interesting sections. This equal inclusion of each instrument creates a full, rich sound that delightfully carries listeners from the opening moments of a piece all the way to the lingering final notes. Lyrical, joyful, and lighthearted, Gentle Winds is the epitome of feel-good chamber music. Every instrument shares an equal voice, coming together in a performance that is as timeless as it is breathtaking.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-yWwMJHssQ&feature=youtu.be,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=NV6197&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Contemporary Era,,,2018 Navona Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2018,Navona,NV6198,896931004985,Scott Perkins ,Perkins: Whispers of Heavenly Death,Julia Mintzer; Eric Trudel; Jamie Jordan; Zachary Wilder; Dashon Burton; Helen Park ,1,CD,11.69,17.99,"First up in this compelling collection is a selection of Walt Whitman's oeuvre, including the work that inspired the album's title, which Perkins' music hauntingly elucidates as the lament of a soul hovering on the brink between life and death. Intriguingly, the composer preserves the mood for the Holy Sonnets by John Donne, a Petrarch-style, English Renaissance collection of sonnets auguring the later Baroque period's preoccupation with the contrast between carnality and mortality. Just as mysterious: the Riddle Songs, poems taken from a 10th-century anthology of Anglo-Saxon poetry, sung in Old English and ethereally brought to life by Perkins' colorful tonal language. With the same unique brushstroke, the listener is seamlessly escorted to the Dogen Songs, minimalist poems by 13th-century Japanese Zen monk Dogen Zenji. A true highlight awaits in the form of the composer's fellow East Coast native, William Carlos Williams, whose poems Spring and All, The Farmer, and The Right of Way, Perkins brings to life with the aptitude and zest of a true kindred spirit. Similarly, Robert Louis Stevenson's Summer Songs are awarded a graceful treatment, with fittingly elaborate lyrical phrasings and an almost neo-Romantic tonality taking the reins. Perkins initially ties in contemporary American poet Lia Purpura's Three Songs for Autumn with the same mood, though ample care is taken not to stifle the freestyle nature of the more modern lyric. Soir d'Hiver (Winter Evening) opens with a bone-chilling chord which could not have been more appropriately chosen for the subject matter: poetic sketches of wintertime hardship and barrenness by several different poets such as Rilke and Verlaine. Whispers of Heavenly Death manages to fit not one, but eight (!) song cycles on one album - and it's an aspirational feat indeed.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQa9sVMVaX0&feature=youtu.be,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=NV6198&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Vocal,,,2018 Navona Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Kawarsky,1,CD,11.69,17.99,"Spoon Hanging From My Nose, the debut album by composer J.A. Kawarsky, combines spirit and wit with compositions that dance between tender and strikingly agitated. With works for orchestra, some composed by Kawarsky and others originally by Brahms but arranged and reimagined by Kawarsky, the album as a whole is a triumphant entrance into the full album release for the composer. Fastidious Notes, the opening piece on the album, is true to its name -- the orchestra is attentive to every last note of the piece. This piece is followed by a series of reinterpretations of Brahms' Liebeslieder Waltzes, originally composed for vocal quartet and piano 4 hands. Kawarsky sets these 18 waltzes to a new accompaniment and orchestration, utilizing 10 instruments, reimagining the performances with a sound that is fresh and full. And We All Waited... takes the tone of the album in a different direction -- this time, delivering a pointed message. After the tragedies of numerous shootings in the United States and far too many lives lost, the composition asks, when is enough enough? For now, people are left to wait while those in charge take time deciding what to do, and the composer suggests that the time for an answer is now, and should have been a long time ago. The album wraps up with Episodes, written for piano and orchestra. Drawing from sources from Prokofiev to traditional Jewish melodies used at Yom Kippur, the piece was composed in celebration of the 75th anniversary of the Westminster Choir College of Rider University. Spoon Hanging From My Nose is a powerful moment within the Navona Records catalog. Not only is Kawarsky introducing his first solo album to the world of music, but the compositions are challenging, humorous, and altogether make a statement that cannot be ignored.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ty-EDmdzXk&feature=youtu.be,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=NV6194&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Orchestral,,,2018 Navona Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Between 1988 and 1995 he wrote three string quartets for the Kronos Quartet that are among his most important mature works. String Quartet No. 1 reveals chorale-like themes, so much a feature of his later writing, as well as hectic, dance-like motion, while the Second Quartet's wider range of expression explicitly evokes Beethoven. Genesis I: Elementi offers a powerful contrast- a string trio from 1962 of uncompromising immediacy. The Tippett Quartet appear regularly at King's Place, the Purcell Room, Wigmore Hall, the Queen Elizabeth Hall and Bridgewater Hall, and perform regularly on BBC Radio 3. They have performed at the BBC Proms and toured Europe, Canada and Mexico. Their broad and diverse repertoire highlights the Tippett Quartet's unique versatility.

He holds a verbal duel with Voltaire, a pistol duel with a Polish noble, and finds himself hauled before the court multiple times, including in London, where the judge in question turns out to be none other than Henry Fielding.

Music for keyboard (whether harpsichord, clavichord or organ) was now being played on what is essentially a wind instrument. I quickly learned that not all music would successfully transcribe to this 'new' instrument. Beethoven and Brahms would be completely out of place in such transcriptions, but there was a considerable body of 'old' music that was sufficiently all-purpose as to become exciting and 'new', especially in the hands of such a creative artist as Milos. Then there were the truly new composers of the twentieth century who were writing for the instrument and exploiting the unique sound characteristics of both classical and free-bass accordions. In the case of the classical accordion, the sheer sight of two hands (120 buttons on the left hand keyboard completely hidden from the performer's view, 58 buttons on the right hand side only occasionally looked at in performance) weaving miracles of tightly-packed movement was, of itself, a fascinating and breath-taking visual experience."

Since the rise of art pour l'art in the nineteenth century, classical music purports to be abstract, but in the longer arc, compositions connect to specific occasions: a coronation, a requiem mass, a religious feast, a dinner party, a regal celebration. Such occasions and commissions present challenges--not least for the composer charged with responding to the myriad consequences of the world's first nuclear reaction. Does one focus on the (positive) reverberations in cancer treatment, power, and science? Does one focus on the (negative) reverberations in bombs, death, waste, and perpetual threats of war? In Plea for Peace, these consequences are inextricable. The clean perfect intervals that begin and end the work give rise to both expansionist leaps and cocooning retractions. The soloist's elegant, wordless vocalise weaves in and out of the string quartet's sustained harmonies in graceful counterpoint, drawing us closer to our common humanity. Simple harmonies slowly transform, becoming rich and complex at the insistent, dramatic climax: a wordless scream from the soul. As the music's opening glow returns, the voice seamlessly dovetailing with the strings, we return to the sonic space of meditation, reflecting on an absolute plea for lasting peace.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=NMP1026&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,United Kingdom,2018 Augusta Read Thomas,2018 Augusta Read Thomas,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He is also a remarkable symphonist. The three works on the present release performed by the Finnish Radio Symphony Orchestra and conducted by Hannu Lintu, represent three important stages in Lutoslawski's career: his 1st Symphony, one of his earliest significant works; Jeux vénitiens was the first work in his best-known stylistic phase; and his 4th Symphony remained his last extensive work. Lutoslawski began his First Symphony in difficult times, during the Nazi occupation of Poland. At the time, he was making a living playing piano duos with composer colleague Andrzej Panufnik in the cafés of Warsaw. It is firmly rooted in Neo-Classicism but has none of the irony or stylization commonly associated with that style. Also, it makes no use of folk music elements, which frequently appear in many of Lutoslawski's post-war works. The title of Jeux vénitiens alludes to the fact that the work was meant to be premiered at the Venice Biennale. In the end, only three movements were performed there in April 1961, and the final four-movement version of the work was premiered in Warsaw in September in the same year. Secondarily, the title alludes to the game-like nature of its aleatoric writing. The Fourth Symphony is a product of Lutoslawski's late period at its most refined, characterized by a more nuanced and translucent harmonic approach than before, greater rhythmic clarity, a more straightforward approach and an expanded role for expressive melodic writing. These features stemmed in part from the fact that the importance of aleatoric sections was decreasing. In the Fourth Symphony, aleatoric counterpoint only accounts for about one fifth of the duration of the work. Conductor Hannu Lintu is an excellent advocate of Lutoslawski's music. Hannu Lintu recently won the Gramophone Award for his recording of the Bartók Violin Concertos together with Christian Tetzlaff and the Finnish Radio Symphony Orchestra.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=ODE%201320-5&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Finland,"2018 Ondine Oy, Helsinki","2018 Ondine Oy, Helsinki",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Eller's legacy is twofold - in his prolific instrumental compositions he forged an elaborate style that successfully combined both modern and national elements, and as a prominent professor of composition during half a century he influenced generations of Estonian composers. This new recording by the Estonian National Symphony Orchestra conducted by Olari Elts and featuring violinist Baiba Skride includes some of the highlights from the composer's catalogue of orchestral works and is a fitting tribute to the centenary of Estonia's independence. Heino Eller's Violin Concerto in B minor was the first in its genre in Estonian music. First written in the 1930s the one-movement work was scheduled to be performed in Tallinn on June 1940. For reasons unknown, the work was withdrawn until March 1965 when Neeme Järvi conducted the premiere. Another work for violin and orchestra, Fantasy, was first written in 1916 and orchestrated in 1964. Fantasy is one of the earliest compositions that bears the hallmarks Eller´s individual style, and its sensitive lyricism and charming simplicity give the work an enduring appeal. The Symphonic Legend is Eller's largest score prior to the First Symphony (1936). It was premiered on June 1923 in Tartu, and Eller revised the score for performance in 1938. A work with a wealth of musical material and masterly orchestration, Symphonic Legend was next performed only in 2014 by Olari Elts with the Estonian NSO, and the current recording is the first. Heino Eller wrote three Symphonies between the 1930s and 1960s. Unlike his other two Symphonies, the 2nd Symphony has only one movement.

They aim, in their Lieder programmes, to recount new, interrelated stories, and to this end, they combine song and pieces for piano in unusual sequences, sometimes plucking verses from one song and placing them individually in a programme; carefully and deliberately choosing keys that connect a number of Lieder in order to provide a dramatic link that results in exciting, flowing and sometimes imperceptible combinations. At the 2017 Schwarzenberg Schubertiade, Elisabeth Kulman and Eduard Kutrowatz dedicated the first part of their programme entirely to Robert Schumann. The lieder cycle Frauenliebe und Leben and the op. 104 songs form a common theme running through this part of the programme. For Elisabeth Kulman and Eduard Kutrowatz the key focus when choosing songs is always on the lyrics, the message, and what may lie behind it. It is therefore hardly surprising that they also chose poems by Erich Kästner set by the Austrian composer Herwig Reiter. His witty, ironic lyrics full of cryptic humor abound with worldly wisdom and hold up a mirror to their readers without merely moralizing or preaching. Placing Herwig Reiter's settings in a dialogue with Lieder by Franz Schubert appears at first glance to be courageous, if not foolhardy. On closer inspection however the art of selection and comparison shown by Kulman and Kutrowatz in their choice of the songs by Reiter and Schubert proves to be the perfect symbiosis.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=ORF-C956181A&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Austria,2018 ORFEO International Music GmbH,2018 ORFEO International Music GmbH,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At length this occurred, with the appearance in 1730 of a second volume, now containing nine such suites. Handel appears eventually to have entered into cooperation with the London publisher John Walsh once the Royal Privilege he had secured for the printing of his own works had expired. Thus a radically revised edition of the suites appeared in 1733-4, and it is this that Scipione Sangiovanni has recorded. Like the Grand Suites, the second volume contains both original and arranged music for keyboard composed throughout Handel's career, though heavily weighted towards his youth: virtually all the contents predate 1706. Having received no further attention from the mature composer, they retain a sense of the confident if sometimes undisciplined exuberance of his youth. They include the grand, standalone G major Chaconne HWV435 as well as a still more expansive example of the form, HWV442. In recording the suites, Scipione Sangiovanni joins an increasing number of soloists who view the range of tonal possibilities afforded by the modern piano as complementary to the soundworld envisaged by the composer. Having recorded a well-received album of Vivaldi's Four Seasons in a solo-piano arrangement, he is practiced in the art of transferring Baroque articulation and idiom to the touch of the piano, which in this case is a Kawai model. The young Italian pianist Scipione Sangiovianni plays the suites on a modern grand piano, in a stylish, natural and utterly musical way, never trying to imitate the harpsichord but letting the music speak for itself. Scipione Sangiovanni is winner of several international piano competitions, among which is the Debut International Piano Competition of New York.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=PCL10143&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Germany,2018 Brilliant Classics,2018 Brilliant Classics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When in 1951 the famous festival reopened its doors, his name became legendary as the Parsifal conductor. The main focus of his concert programmes, however, was the works of the great Romantic nineteenth-century composers, especially Johannes Brahms and Anton Bruckner. Despite that subsequent generations have developed their own views on those works, Knappertsbusch's recordings have retained their benchmark status to this day. Born in Elberfeld, now part of the city of Wuppertal, in 1888, Knappertsbusch was Music Director at the city's opera house before he went, via Leipzig and Dessau, to Munich, where he eventually succeeded Bruno Walter as General Music Director. He was no fan of the Nazi regime, however, and so he left Munich and went to Vienna to conduct the Philharmonic and opera, returning eventually to Munich, where he died in 1965, after conducting his last Bayreuth Parsifal the previous year.

Innumerable works give evidence of her impressive erudition and of her exceptional linguistic and musical talent. Not only during her lifetime did the abbess, poet, and composer Hildgard of Bingen have great influence on theological and societal nexuses, but even today she is esteemed throughout the world for her world view and visions. For ten years, the mystery play Ordo virtutum by Hildegard of Bingen has been an important component in the repertoire of the women's schola Ars Choralis Coeln. Under the artistic direction of Maria Jonas, the ensemble has occupied itself intensively with the interpretation and realization of the work. After diagnosis of the texts and in-depth studies, Maria Jonas translated the title of the work as "Order of the Powers." This is now the subtitle of the present recording. Divine and heavenly powers are confronted with "diabolic" vices. In order to maintain the "Ordo," God's order of the world, the human soul is given powers that enable human beings to withstand the profligate. Hildegard's fundamental idea: a human being is responsible for himself/herself and has to bear the consequences for his/her own decisions. In the recording, Diabolus (the devil) does not have a voice, but plays recorder - performed here by Lucia Mense, who developed medieval playing techniques as well as contemporary sounds and noises for her role. With these the devil attempts to seduce Anima (the soul), who expresses the devil's influence on her - and vicariously on all of our souls - with a Babylonian confusion of languages.

The first of Concertante's Modern Works For Guitar opens with the three-movement Concertante for guitar, jazz trio and strings - a work that allows all of the album's performers to be featured as soloists. Its kaleidoscopic first movement reveals elements of Latin, Blues, Jazz, and Classical genres that, when combined with the Spanish touches in the final movement, encompass the major musical styles that have influenced Ross over the past 30 years. The two sets of Variations on the album reflect his life-long admiration for the McCartney/Lennon oeuvre. While playing homage to "Norwegian Wood" and "World Without Love," both pieces fall more to the improvisatory end of the compositional scale. The second portion of the release, which features works written by Gerardo and Ariel Dirié, is filled with modern guitar works that have never before been recorded. Ross first presents a series of pieces written by Ariel Dirié, who passed in 2010, leaving behind a collection of works, some of which are light and some of which are dark, some playful and some serious. The final three works on the album form a triptych, Si un dia el Olvido (If one day oblivion...), which "gather different evocations of time."

Written for dance, both fixed media and live computer-mediated performance, Coffey's music feels spontaneous without sacrificing finely calculated craft. Petals 8 starts off the album. The composition draws inspiration from gagaku, the 'elegant music' of Japanese medieval courts. Featuring, as Coffey described, a "funky-slash-improbable-yet-maybe-inevitable instrumental assemblage," Petals 8 moves with quiet commitment through cycles of suspended moments -- and close vocoded vocal harmonies, too. It is followed by Petals 1, 2 & 3, three attacca movements of electronic music for dance, composed in response to different compositional problems that both music and dance work through. One Note Solo, which can be experienced here with its original video by Aaron Henderson, demonstrates how a single note can be squeezed and stretched into a composition of spellbinding presence. The final track on the album, Sonatina, is a concluding statement that accumulates eight years of sonic experimentation, from viola da gamba hooks to microphone feedback, demonstrating how computer music transcends time and space. Collected Works for Dance connects visuals and sounds through the computer-mediated experience.

With a total of 18 boy choristers and 6 lay vicars, Chichester has one of the smallest cathedral choirs in Britain. The lay vicars are all professional singers and live in or near the Cathedral Close. The choristers are educated at the Prebendal School where they start as 'Probationers' in Year 3 or 4 (age 7-9), rising to the rank of chorister after about one year. The choir regularly tours abroad, enjoying particularly close links with Ravenna, Bayreuth, Bamberg and Chartres.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=SIGCD562&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Choral,Germany,2018 Signum Records,2018 Signum Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The title of the debut album "Razor Blades Little Pills and Big Pianos", hints at the suffering that dogged Rhodes's childhood and early adult life. Classical music became his solace and key to his survival. It was Bach, Beethoven and Chopin, not Faith Hope and Charity, that offered comfort. In 1993, mental health issues stopped him taking up a scholarship to the Guildhall. Suffering further setbacks due to health issues it was not until 2008, when Rhodes met his present manager, Denis Blais, that he was encouraged to record his first album. This enabled him to bare his soul and put many of the ghosts of the past to rest. With Blais, Rhodes also created a distinctive and unique approach to how the classical piano repertoire should be presented. Uncomfortable with the austere and traditional 'white tie and tails' recital they decided it was time for the performer to communicate directly with the audience. Rhodes was going to introduce his own programme notes and share what it takes to perform these works of art using fascinating anecdotes about the composers and his own life experience. Delivered in his unique trademark stand-up style he creates an immersive experience that has won him and classical music a dedicated new following.

Vandor, at least the most recent Vandor, lives, like Kurtag, in history; though unlike his fellow Hungarian composer, he has no love of citation. Mitteleurope's presence is constantly evoked, but as echo or resonance, not as literal quotation. The neo-classical passion for the ancient is absent; but glimmers of a lost world with which Vandor is in dialogue are present. After the experimental research of his youth and the improvisations with the group Musica Elettronica Viva, Vandor took refuge in an ecstatic limbo, like that of the Duo for viola and piano, or the cello pieces included in this album. The syncretism of the Klavierquartett is remarkable, as is the emotional cantabile, close to Bartokian elegy, of the string Trio, the masterpiece of this collection. Time is recurrently held in suspension, as in Webern's Bagatellen op. 9. There is no trace in Vandor's work of the Tibetan Buddhism which fascinated him as a musicologist; his is a personality with two autonomous souls not engaged in dialogue; so much so that all facile ethnic referencing or orientalism is avoided. His is a solitary world, suspended on the brink of interiority. Listening to this music reveals a touching spiritual joy. Vandor is an untimely Maestro. In dialogue with the shadows, he is not afraid to recreate the past, to live in lyrical intimacy the return of the forgotten."",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=STR37083&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Modern Era,Italy,Milano Dischi,Milano Dischi,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Why a thrill? Because I have had the joy of sharing with him much of his Italian journey: he arrived in Italy in 2006, having already obtained his diploma of composition in Iran. Mehdi (as we always called him) began my composition class at the Conservatorio di Milano, doing entire bachelor course and master degree course. Five years later, he took his diploma and obtained the highest honours, and subsequently specialised at the Accademia di Santa Cecilia in Rome with Ivan Fedele. I want, at least, to remember the splendid way the composer leads us by the hand slowly to the appearance of an instrument that is so strange for us: a dense texture of the ensemble, which does not allow individuality to show through, starts from a rather dark region and gradually rises: the subtle sound of the Kamanche will take up the register given to it by the ensemble and will lead it still higher, much higher. From there begins a formal curve that becomes progressively dramatic, until it culminates in an extremely tense climax, which fundamentally we did not expect, given the initial climate. It opens a final chasm between the very high and very low regions, a true abyss into which the rhythmic pulsation reminds us of the climax of the Violinkonzert by Alban Berg: east and west shake hands, in the life and work of Mehdi Khayami."",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=STR37107&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Modern Era,Italy,Milano Dischi,Milano Dischi,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A survivor of the Terezín concentration camp, where he had been interned as a Czech Jew, after the War he settled in Munich as a German citizen, and his music enjoyed a number of broadcasts - but after his death, his estate disappeared into the vaults of the Sudeten German Music Institute, where it was placed under embargo, emerging only in 2015. This first album of his music reveals an unusual and individual voice, an idiosyncratic blend of Stravinsky, Janácek and Hindemith, with touches of Poulenc, often expressed with brittle humor and rhythmic verve. The Arizona Wind Quintet is the faculty ensemble-in-residence at the University of Arizona Fred Fox School of Music in Tucson. Formed in 1977, the AWQ has cultivated a tradition of excellence in both performance and teaching. The other instrumentalists on this recording are distinguished musicians active in the Tucson area, several of them teaching at the Fred Fox School of Music, although they appear in concert and at festivals all over North America.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=TOCC0491&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,,Toccata Classics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The piece was first drafted in Assisi in 1723, when Zuccari was Kapellmeister, with a second version with instruments being drafted in 1745, when the musician was first organist at the Santo. The work has, however, presumably not been performed again since that year. The Magnificat in F major also hails from Assisi. It was composed in 1725 and revised later in Padova in 1748. In this recording, the ensemble uses Vallotti's typical tuning, which favors the use of flats and limits the interval of the fifth, showing a greater precision in the interval of third. The Orchestra Barocca di Cremona, conducted by Giovanni Battista Columbro, performs here on original instruments.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=LDV14042&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Baroque Era,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

WERGO now releases a new album with some his most famous song compositions, sung by Mikis Theodorakis himself! The present release contains 12 compositions by the great Greek composer, some of which were written during the Papadopoulos dictatorship in the years 1967-74. In his exile, Theodorakis rearranged texts of his own and texts of other modern Greek poets to produce these compositions. The songs are timeless, lyrical, yet also political and have lost none of their topicality: 'I was fortunate to work with outstanding poets so that the texts and messages of my songs can be regarded as timeless.'

In the second part of 2018 and early 2019 Poem of a Cell will be shown at Maerkisches Museum in Witten, Germany, at the international art festival FAB in Bordeaux, France and at OAG in Tokyo, Japan. Winter & Winter is presenting a set of three releases (Vol. 1, 2 and 3) with recorded works and sounds produced for Poem of a Cell. Uri Caine set in music the first chapter of "The Song of Songs" from the Jewish Tanakh written for Exaudi and a gospel piece with the title "Shine" for jazz ensemble. Besides these compositions and further arrangements by Uri Caine works by William Byrd, Joseph Haydn, Orlando di Lasso and Gustav Mahler can be discovered in outstanding recordings of classical and experimental music. Volume 2 will focus on the Christian mystic Mechthild of Magdeburg and Volume 3 on the Islamic Sufis Rabi'a of Basra. All three works are based on the unifying theme that brings Judaism, Christianity and Islam together and bridges all their differences: love, ecstasy and, ultimately, the unification with the divine love. It is about desire and spite, longing and disgust, violence and lenity, destruction and salvation, separation and unification, innocence and guilt, permission and suppression, woman and man. In Poem of a Cell reality and fantasy merge seamlessly. It is a stunning journey into the life of mankind.",http://www.winterstefan.com/de/works/gedicht-einer-zelle/trailer,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=910250-2&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Jazz,Germany,2018 Winter & Winter GmbH,2018 Winter & Winter GmbH,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As he came back to Tokyo, he became an influential artist, as well as a successful composer. Miyake has closely worked with Pina Bausch, Wim Wenders, Robert Wilson, Oliver Stone, Jean-Paul Goude, Philippe Decoufle, and others, and has collaborated with artists such as Hal Willner, Arto Lindsay, Arthur H, Vinicius Cantuaria, and many others. With his ability to blend the most seemingly disparate elements of music, he has achieved much respect throughout the world. Miyake's album ""Stolen from strangers"" was selected as ""best album of the year"" for numerous European music magazines, and the Grand Prix for the German Record Critics Award 2008. He was selected as ""man of 2009"" by Galerie Lafatette homme. Jun Miyake's music comes light-footed as the bossa nova, accessible as sophisticated pop and refined and versatile as lively jazz. Lost Memory Theatre is an ever-changing constellation of sound images and scenes, bossa nova and reggae, Kurt Weill and Nino Rota, chanson and symphony, jazz and improvisation, rock and folk: the album is a must-hear from start to finish, mixing all styles and genres to create a hybrid of musical genius.
