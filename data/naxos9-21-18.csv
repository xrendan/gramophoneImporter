The three-week tour of Beijing, Shanghai, and Kunming became the framework represented by this duo's debut album name, Providence. What followed immediately was the weaving together of three continents and years of planning out of the repertoire of that tour. Boccherini's Sonata No. 5 in A Major is representative of the composer's bringing violincello writing into more melodic and virtuosic milieu, here represented so wonderfully by a viola. Vaughan Williams' "Romance" is among several pieces discovered after the composer had passed, but thought to have been composed in 1914. "Whither Must I Wander", originally for piano and Baritone from his song cycle Songs of Travel, was arranged for the duo on this album by Ellen Rose and Kristin Ditlow, and is therefore a premiere recording. Enescu's "Concertpiece" is a combination of his native Romania and Paris where he lived much of his life, with traces of Debussy and French impressionists and the theme from a lively Romanian folk dance. Messiaen's "Louange" uses religious quotes as well as bird calls, Messiaen being both a devout Catholic and an enthusiastic ornithologist. Rebecca Clarke's Sonata was the largest work on the China tour, her best-known work, and was written for a 1919 competition, in which she tied Ernest Bloch for first place with its combination of whole tone, octatonic and pentatonic scales as well as piano and string writing which shows great admiration for Debussy. Ending the album with a Puccini aria from Tosca coincides with using this piece as the encore from the China tour. There is no doubt that this album musically soothes and excites the soul with a vast combination of exquisite musical textures and stunning performances!",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=AF1808&medium=phydig,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Chamber Music,United States,2018 Affetto Records,2018 Affetto Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The third work, Lou Harrison's stirring "La Koro Sutro (The Heart's Soul)" is a vibrant and moving piece with the choir accompanied by The American Gamelan Kunsonoro kaj Gloro (Chime and Glory). La Koro Sutra, a live performance recording, was described by Anthony Tommasini in the New York Times as "...one of the best musical moments of the year." Composer Lou Harris had a life-long interest in the use of "found instruments" and those used in this recording appeared in his works of the 30s and 40s for percussion ensemble which he wrote while collaborating with John Cage. His later works were composed with highly chromatic music influenced heavily by Arnold Schoenberg. The 1971 piece featured here, La Koro Sutro, is a setting of the Buddhist Heart Suttra in Esperanto composed for an international congress of Esperanto speakers in San Francisco. The "Three Songs for Men's Chorus" are settings from the Book of Samuel and Walt Whitman's "Calamus" in Leaves of Grass. Finally, New Zealander Christopher Marshall's work, "Dark Night of the Soul" sets mystical text of St. John at the Cross with intricate rhythms of a beautiful lyrical melody with rich choral sonority.

Why is it difficult to play the music of Francois Couperin when it seems so simple at first glance? By offering precious information on the interpretation of his music (and more generally on the interpretation of French music of his time) in his treatise L'Art de toucher le clavecin (The art of harpsichord playing), Couperin provides us with the necessary elements for today's performer, who seeks above all to respect the composer's intentions. However, fear of not going beyond the indications given by the latter and excessive attention to every detail can inhibit inspiration and distract from the purpose of the works. Like the French language, it consists of rules but also of many exceptions. Modern grammars and dictionaries give us complete, firm, infallible answers to all these questions. But things were quite different at the time. Canadian harpsichordist Olivier Fortin has chosen this music for his new release. Olivier Fortin is founder (1996) and director of the Montreal-based early music Ensemble Masques. He is increasingly esteemed as a soloist and chamber musician, touring and recording throughout Europe, the United States and Canada with ensembles such as Ensemble Masques, Capriccio Stravagante, Tafelmusik, Chanticleer, the Studio de Musique Ancienne de Montréal and Les Voix Humaines as well as playing with Skip Sempé and Pierre Hantaï in a harpsichord trio.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=ALPHA408&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Austria,2018 Olivier Fortin,2018 Alpha Classics / Outhere Music France,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung recently wrote of his performance as 'lively, with a fine timbre', while Forumopera added: 'Julien Behr's Fenton is superb: though the French tenor has hitherto been especially appreciated as a Mozartian, here he confirms his aptitude for nineteenth-century repertory.' And it is the French Romantic repertory composed between 1800 and 1900 that the tenor has chosen for his first recital album. A wide variety of works make up this programme devised by the Palazzetto Bru Zane and Alexandre Dratwicki, who writes: "Nothing is more difficult for a tenor than "finding his voice" in this imbroglio of genres and institutions . . . Already much admired for his charismatic vocal style and personality, the tenor Julien Behr is now the hero of a recital that revisits this repertory in all its variety, ranging from tenderness to heroism, from joy to melancholy."

He especially charmed us with his incomparable sonority and the very expressive song of his instrument." However, posterity in the nineteenth century was most unkind to him, allowing him to "survive" thanks to a Minuet chosen at random, transposed for and endlessly churned out by every possible instrument (and even the voice), a somewhat "doctored" concerto, and finally editions of a small batch of "sonatas for cello and piano" adorned with an improbable arsenal of technical and performance markings far removed from the Boccherinian spirit. Bruno Cocset pays tribute to one of the precursors of the Golden Age of the cello by recording five sonatas based on the manuscripts of the extensive Noseda Collection of the Milan Conservatory.

He scored the work for orchestral forces very differently from the ensembles used in the nineteenth century. Hans Zender describes his work as a 'creative transformation': "My own reading of Winterreise does not seek a new expressive interpretation, but systematically takes advantage of the freedoms that performers normally allow themselves in an intuitive way: slowing down or accelerating the tempo, transposition into different keys, emphasizing and nuancing colors." Following a staged production of this version of the work, Christian Merlin wrote in Le Figaro in 2018: "A spellbinding Winterreise . . .

A lingua franca is any language or hybrid of several languages used as a common tongue--an apt description of Feurzeig's music, which speaks in a unique personal synthesis made from elements of highly diverse styles. The entire album was recorded, mixed, and mastered by Grammy-winning producer and recording engineer Adam Abeshouse. The title piece features the "world's top-selling cello/bass duo" Low & Lower (Brooks Whitehouse and Paul Sharpe) in a virtuosic display as they play while reciting or singing five gems of International English--today's lingua franca--which range from a Belgrade hotel elevator sign ("press a number of wishing floor") to the instructions on a chopstick wrapper ("the traditional and typical of Chinese glonous history"). Feurzeig is the performer on the alternately poignant and hilarious "Four Homages," which reimagines the work of great composer-pianists of the past in contemporary vernacular piano styles: from the Bartokian "Bela's Blues" to "Stride Rite," a 3-minute summary of the Rite of Spring in ragtime. The set concludes with a tribute to Martin Luther King, a quodlibet of "We Shall Overcome" and "Happy Birthday," which is both a cri de couer for our troubled times and somehow also a rollicking boogie-woogie celebration. The album begins and ends with pieces for unaccompanied solo string instrument. Whitehouse performs the majestic five-movement Sonata for Solo Cello, which extends the monumental tradition of the Benjamin Britten solo sonatas into the 21st century with innovative virtuoso techniques.

Otherwise, most scholars who have tried to trace the story of calypso agree that the word itself is not connected with the deity who lured Homer's Odysseus to her island. The origins of the word are unclear and scholars debate this with no definitive answer. The name possibly began with the French 'carrouseaux' and went through patois and Anglicization. There are also suggestions that the name originated with exclamations of encouragement to the singer by the chorus or audience or both. But whatever process brought the word into everyday use, the point is that calypso is here. Quick wit, knowing observation of human behavior, and comment on its absurd aspects are the bill of fare offered in calypso, which probably prompted Time to label calypso "The Living Newspaper" in 1944. For eloquence and topical diversity, no other genre can approach the calypso of Trinidad and Tobago, for the calypsonian assumes a stance between editorialist, moralist, and satirist as scandal, disaster, politics, self-praise, sexual indiscretion and everything from local to international events prove as grist for the mill.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=EUCD2810&medium=phy,30 World/Int'l.,World|Calypso,World|Calypso,Austria,,2018 ARC Music Productions Int.

The Western African influences in blues music are unmistakable and are explored enthusiastically by these West African artists. Along the southern coast of Western Africa, and heading into central Africa, a noticeable percussive style takes over. Drumming in these parts of Africa is an ancient, often tribal, tradition that continues to this day. We travel next to Eastern Africa and Sudan, a country with a long and turbulent history that has seen its religion and politics influence its music in many ways.

Similarly, Macy Gray occupies a rare space in the canon of modern music. Her tenth full-length album, Ruby, reaffirms and reasserts that signature rarity millions continue to treasure. "I love the gem ruby," she explains. "It's so regal. I really wanted a title that would stick. The stone is also red of course, which is my favorite color. It's rich and has history. It's classic--and so is this album." Channeling the spirit of the "grimy" R&B and smoky jazz closest to her heart, Macy made a leap forward by looking back to formative inspirations. However, she updated those elements with enriched, entrancing, and enigmatic soundscapes brought to life by producers Johan Carlsson, Tommy Brown, and Tommy Parker Lumpkins. "They're all stellar producers, and they helped me craft an incredibly rich project," she goes on. "They were brilliant in integrating horns and strings. There are so many complex layers.

Midon - who earned his first GRAMMY nomination for Bad Ass and Blind, his Artistry Music/Mack Avenue album of 2017 - worked hand in glove on If You Really Want with another renowned GRAMMY winner and frequent Metropole Orkest collaborator: conductor-composer-arranger Vince Mendoza. He created beautifully dynamic arrangements, inspired not only by the singer-guitarist's melodies, harmonies and rhythms but by his lyrics, too. Alongside fresh versions of six favorites from past Midon albums, If You Really Want features four previously unrecorded songs: "If You Really Want," "Ride On A Rainbow," "Ocean Dreamer" and "All Love Is Blind." This past spring, Midon performed in National Public Radio's popular "Tiny Desk Concert" feature, with NPR prefacing the broadcast by saying: "Raul Midon lives in a world of sound - blind since birth, Midon's interpretation of his surroundings is borderless.

So it is my job as an interpreter on the song to lead those listeners speedily and simply into this sphere, to open the way for them into this quite different world. On this album are songs that I have grown into. Straight away Alban Berg with his "Seven Early Songs", I definitely wanted to record them in their original version for piano, although I do sing the orchestral version as well these days. Then I searched with pianist Juliane Ruf - she is really on my wavelength - and we soon found Lieder from Richard Strauss. I am in my element with his music and it fits in well with Berg's fin-de-siècle feeling. Then we targeted our search on songs that leave reality behind, and came upon songs with flowers as their theme. There is a lot of ambiguity in them. I believe the feelings that are portrayed, addressed, analyzed in these songs are absolutely contemporary feelings as well. Since they were composed decades have passed, there is much that we may express in different words today, as a singer, I translate that state into the present day. They are beautiful, wonderfully executed paintings of girls, miniatures on an imaginary wall, which speak directly to us."",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhPH4PJkpm0,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=BVE08034&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Art Song,Germany,2017 belvedere edition,2017 belvedere edition,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Schreier and Werba obviously intended to present Mozart's entire lied repertoire, except for those songs whose texts were too obviously written from the perspective of a female protagonist. From today's perspective the interpretation of the Mozart songs in this recital is remarkably homogeneous. For Peter Schreier, the opera singer, Mozart was the first true romantic composer. The songs are presented in a deeply emotional, but never sentimental manner. The chosen tempos are therefore rather on the slow side of the spectrum and here as well as in the ballad-like song "Das Veilchen" K476, Schreier makes it apparent how he reads Mozart's mature, through-composed songs as text based and text centered, as if they were foreshadowing Schubert, Schumann and Brahms.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=BVE08022&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Art Song,Germany,2016 belvedere edition,2016 belvedere edition,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Teack's novella is based on a chivalric romance from the 14th century, which in turn is itself based on a saga from Provence. It tells the story of the knight Peter, victorious in his every tournament. It tells of his travels, of his courting of Magelone, the beautiful princess of Naples, of her kidnapping, their separation and the lovers' happy reunification after numerous adventures. The peculiar poetry of these lied texts, their emotional variety and unusual form impressed the young Johannes Brahms who set the songs to music.

Mozart's "Kleine deutsche Kantate" KV 619 can be heard as an appeal by the composer in our present international political situation, an appeal for tolerance and unity. Desire is the theme that weaves in various aspects through all three parts of the concert. Prévin bases his compositions on contemporary American poetry and with them touches on the wish for recognition as well as the wish for the abolition of inequality between people. Strauss, on the other hand, expresses in his distinctive tone colors the search for peace of mind in nature and in a love that is beyond this world. Barbara Bonney, André Previn und Franz Bartolomay convey all these messages with a fine yet robust down-to-earth artistry.

"Light & Dark" is the world's first recording of a solo organ recital in the Grand Hall. Featuring a range of appealing contemporary works, the album showcases the wide tonal spectrum of the Elbphilharmonie's organ. Built by the Bonn-based firm Klais, the organ is an instrument of superlatives. 4,765 pipes extend over five rows of seats, their lengths ranging from just eleven millimeters to an imposing ten meters. Thanks to the very open structure of the hall's "white skin" around the organ, audiences can actually look inside the instrument and some of the pipes have been coated such that they can be touched without leaving any marks. The organ fits perfectly into the spectacular architecture and has a very impressive sound. "There's nothing this organ can't do," Iveta Apkalna enthused. "It's warm and rich, with many beautiful fundamental tones that sound from everywhere, and from the depths. The sound embraces the audience." With its modern selection of repertoire, seemingly tailor-made for both the organist and the instrument, the album compellingly draws listeners into a fascinating world of sound. At the heart of the recording is the work that gives the album its name - Sofia Gubaidulina's "Light and Darkness", a piece of great extremes that penetrates every fiber of the body. Two composers, Aivars Kalejs and Lucija Garuta, hail from the organist's native Latvia, and the album also includes works by Leos Janacek, Gyorgy Ligeti, Dmitri Shostakovich, and Thierry Escaich.

2018,Berlin Classics,0301116BC,885470011165,Modest Mussorgsky; Sergei Rachmaninoff ,Faure Quartet: Pictures at an Exhibition; Etudes-Tableaux,Faure Quartet ,1,CD,18.71,28.99,"It's the Roaring Twenties. That musical jack-of-all-trades, Sergei Koussevitsky, Director of Music with the Boston Symphony Orchestra for twenty-five years, commissions the orchestration of two world-famous works: Pictures at an Exhibition by Modest Mussorgsky and the etudes-Tableaux by Sergey Rachmaninoff. And who does Koussevitsky choose for this task? Why, none other than the two great composers Maurice Ravel and Ottorino Respighi. Their orchestrations lay the foundations for numerous other arrangements of those works. More than 80 years later, Dirk Mommertz, a member of and pianist with the Faure Quartett, has arranged both of these works anew - this time for piano quartet. "A chamber music ensemble, with piano and strings, is ideally suited to present the entire tonal spectrum," explains Dirk Mommertz. Violinist Erika Geldsetzer, violist Sascha Frombling, cellist Konstantin Heidrich and Mommertz at the piano have been an entity for over 25 years now and are justifiably acknowledged as one of the most influential piano quartets in the world. They are renowned for branching out into new territory; they are not afraid of leaving the well-trodden path, so it comes as no surprise that the Faure Quartett have recorded for the first time their own arrangements of Pictures at an Exhibition and the etudes-Tableaux on one album. The mesh of relationships which binds Mussorgsky's composition of 1874 and Rachmaninoff's of 1911-1918 with Koussevitsky's commissions to Ravel and Respighi, now ends 150 years later with the Faure Quartett in the 21st century. The versions for piano quartet bring to the works an unexpected palette of colors. They are flexible, yet dense; more tangible than when played by a whole orchestra, yet none the less thrilling - works possessing unique soul and intense coloring, with as-yet-unheard facets and turns; works that exhibit great spans of upheaval and fading tranquility.",https://youtu.be/ISF08takDpE,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=0301116BC&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Chamber Music,Germany,2018 Edel Germany GmbH,2018 Edel Germany GmbH,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rarely has a recording debut had the impact of Eldbjorg's debut album, and she has since been catapulted into international awareness in a very short time. On this release, we have more standard repertoire, no less well played and beautifully accompanied by the Antwerp Symphony Orchestra (previously the Royal Flemish Symphony Orchestra) under Alan Buribayev. This is the second record in a projected long series. A champion of Norway's rich musical tradition, Eldbjorg Hemsing has been performing on some of the world's most prestigious stages since age 11, when she made her solo debut with the Bergen Philharmonic Orchestra. Her violin playing represents a unique blend of classic Viennese sound, drawn from her lessons with Boris Kuschnier; a contemporary sensibility absorbed through numerous projects with the Oscar-winning composer Tan Dun; and a deep affinity with her Scandinavian heritage that she proudly showcases in every aspect of her active musical life.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=BIS-2246&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Violin,EU,"2017 BIS Records AB, Sweden","2018 BIS Records AB, Sweden",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is an encore for basically all Swedish orchestras touring abroad. So why limit oneself to recording just that? Well, because the Cantata demands quite big forces - 4 soloists with demanding parts and 2 choruses on top of a quite large orchestra. It has only been commercially recorded once before, by Herbert Blomstedt. Recording the work has been on Neeme Jarvi's wish list for decades. All the better now that, when he has turned 80, he was finally able to fulfill his dreams, and with extremely good forces at that: four brilliant soloists, the two choruses and Stenhammar's own orchestra, the Gothenburg Symphony in their great hall. Concert Master Sara Troback does pride to the Two Sentimental Romances and the group has something as edifying as a very large movement for oboe solo in the Suite.

Morris's new recording features works ranging from Glass's constantly shifting 'Melodies' (1995) to the driving minimalist rhythms and figures of 'Gradus' (1968) and 'Piece in the Shape of a Square' (1967). 'Melodies' was written as incidental music for a play based on the novel, Un Captif Amoureux (Prisoner of Love) by the French author Jean Genet. Glass's thirteen melodies cover a wide range of emotion, from touching and introspective to joyous and dancing. The visual element of 'Piece in the Shape of a Square,' is much more a part of the composition than it is in 'Gradus.' The music is set up in a roughly 10' square, with one performer on the inside of the square and one performer on the outside. The performer on the inside moves around the square in a clockwise direction, while the performer on the outside moves around in a counterclockwise direction.

Cabell, 2005 winner of the BBC Cardiff Singer of the World Competition, is "a faultlessly gleaming soprano" (Financial Times). Cambridge is "radiant, vocally assured . . . and artistically imaginative" (Washington Post), known for her "revelatory, sensual, smoky readings" (Opera News). Joining them in the "Soave sia il vento" trio from Mozart's Così fan tutte is the "mellow-voiced and charismatic" (New York Times) baritone Will Liverman. They're accompanied on their Cedille debut by the Lake Forest Symphony under 2015 Sir Georg Solti Conducting Award winner Vladimir Kulenovic. Inspired by opera stars Kathleen Battle & Jessye Norman's spirituals recording from the early 1990s, the sopranos describe their album as a "dream project" that's "uniquely us," reflecting their multi-ethnic heritages and showcasing songs that profoundly influenced them both.

In each of these cycles, Andrew crafts a psychological journey. He weaves soaring vocal lines and innovative textures in the piano. He creates bold and soul-searching atmospheres, utterly and unmistakably his own. He is not afraid to experiment with extremes of range, the resonant capacities of the grand piano, the twisting of harmonic pathways, in order to create sound worlds that reveal the truth of a poetic moment. His absolute reverence for text-setting is transformed into a meditation, a triangulation of musical, emotional, and spiritual thought. Composer Andrew Staniland has firmly established himself as one of Canada's most important and innovative musical voices. Described by Alex Ross in the New Yorker magazine as "alternately beautiful and terrifying", his music is regularly heard on CBC Radio 2 and has been performed and broadcast internationally in over 35 countries. Andrew is the recipient of the 2009 National Grand Prize in EVOLUTION, presented by CBC Radio 2/Espace Musique and The Banff Centre, top prizes in the SOCAN young composers competition, and the 2004 Karen Keiser Prize in Canadian Music. As a leading composer of his generation, he has been recognized by election to the Inaugural Cohort of the College of New Scholars, Artists and Scientists Royal Society of Canada in 2014.

The inspiration comes from Honing's love for classical music, history and art. The central theme and motive for this album is Europe and heroism. In these times when people do not always realize the value of Europe and 70 years of peace, Honing tells a binding story. During his research into the history of Europe, he chose Germany as a symbol of Europe because of their many writers, philosophers, composers and painters, and because of its resilience and the leadership role they now take in Europe. Honing was especially inspired by the beauty of Richard Wagner's music and that of his disciple Richard Strauss. Both were determined in their music, even though they did not conform to the tastes of their time. Goldbrun, the title of the album, is a non-existent term. For Honing, it stands for the way he composed this album. The themes are interwoven into a larger whole, which characterizes that each second interval of the main theme is a small second. This way of non-linear composing he learned from the music of John Coltrane. "I compose from a core and work from there to the edges... harmonic structures that start in the middle and spread out. It's a spherical thing, Goldbrun."",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=CR%2073447&medium=phy,02 Jazz,Jazz,,Belgium,2018 Challenge Records,2018 Challenge Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She says: "In the last few years I have been drawn to Faure's music with its rich textures and sensuous, dark, hypnotic harmonies. I discovered his Impromptus which are rarely performed, perhaps partly because of their very virtuoso writing. That led me to an exploration of the genre of impromptus more generally: I was excited by the improvisational quality and variety of mood - from playful miniatures to dark, melancholic, profound pieces of music." The Scriabin Impromptus are similarly underrepresented in the discography and are programmed here alongside jewels in the piano repertoire, the Chopin Impromptus. Katya says: "These very different composers' styles complement each other yet there is a common romantic thread running through; and I thought that, together, they would make a very beautiful programme centered around the Impromptu form."

"True In No Possible World" is the motto of the debut album of the saxophonist and composer Benedict Koch, and everyone wonders what he really means. The term originates from modal logic, a branch of the logic that deals with the consequences of the modal terms "possible" and "necessary." As a result, you can not only derive secure statements such as "it is raining" or "All circles are round" from modal logic, but also such theses that question them in principle: "It is maybe raining" or "All circles are necessarily round." Confusing? Possibly. But Benedict Koch is less interested in a deeper meaning, with which his music could be analyzed and lifted to an intellectually higher level. "I chose this sentence above all because it fits phonetically to my music," the 30-year-old gave the answer to the riddle in an amazingly simple way. Koch has here created an album full of facets, mild shimmering colors and finely regulated feelings of melancholy all the way to cautious joy with his new quintet.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=DMCHR71198&medium=phy,02 Jazz,Jazz,,Austria ,2018 Challenge Records,2018 Challenge Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An exceptional man who ruled the Roman Empire at its apogee, the second century of our era, and who cultivated philosophy from an early age. Can one be emperor while still being stoic? Starting from the Auguste History and the writings of the philosopher, Veronique Boudon-Millot traces his story from his childhood with his mother Domitia the pious, to his first years of governance, the fighting against the barbarians, and the fight against Christianity.

What is the purpose of our living? How do connections with others happen? What is the meaning of sacredness and spiritual light? And: How do we continually affirm ourselves as we walk our individual journeys? This album explores all of those questions through words and music--presenting a broad canvas of questions with really no answers, except those answers that are defined by our own lives. On this release, life's unanswered questions are explored in Thomas LaVoy's 'Songs of the Questioner.' How we abide with ourselves and others through love is one of life's most poignant questions, and is explored in Dan Forrest's 'Abide' through the words of Jake Adam York. LaVoy's 'White Stones' paints a musical scene of a child's night terrors, and of his parents' struggle to reassure him and to teach the child spiritual comfort while dealing with the reality of life. Two pieces by Peter Relph allow the listener to journey into the world of spiritual "enlightenment" by creating a luminous and comforting spiritual presence. Spiritual questioning throughout life asks us to seek answers to some of life's most human questions: 'The Dream I Knew' provides answers to the basic life question of the value of others in our life's journey; LaVoy's 'Salvator mundi' reminds us all of the spiritual stillness that abiding and questioning provides. Paul Mealor's setting of C. S. Lewis reminds us of the pivotal role that love plays in our life journey.

The title of Kvernberg's latest project was not chosen at random. Steamdome presents thoroughly percussive music. It lunges brutally ahead like a runaway train. As enthusiastic, surrealistic and swelling as Sergio Leone's spaghetti westerns. Fiddle ace Ola Kvernberg has held a prominent place in the Norwegian music community since his early teens. His family is full of folk musicians, but Ola has carved his own distinctive path. So far he has composed the music for seven films, has been remixed by Todd Terje, and has collaborated with saxophonist Joshua Redman, crime writer Jo Nesbø, Stian Carstensen, Mathias Eick, Motorpsycho, Pat Metheny and Jimmy Carl Black from the Mothers of Invention - to name just a few. "Steamdome is both more limitless and more brazen than my previous projects. The time was ripe to wield the broadest paintbrush and stir up the biggest emotions with this band," says Ola. "Maybe a lot of what I have done before appealed to a dedicated audience of listeners, but Steamdome is to a much greater degree a physical experience." Steamdome changes track, and barrels along into a landscape where rhythmical patterns, beat and groove are the dominant elements. The Mechanical Fair was described as belonging to a "mutton western" genre, and this description is, if anything, even more appropriate now. With three of the country's most innovative drummers on board, the bows, strings and resin have been replaced by sticks, metal and a variety of drums. Steamdome is seething with visual energy. The music winds its way through steep cliffs, far-ranging vistas, sharp curves, sheer drops and nocturnal landscapes where the only anchoring point is the suggestive rhythm of a train that never stops.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=GRCD4569&medium=phy,02 Jazz,Jazz,Rock,,2017 Grappa Musikkforlag AS,2017 Grappa Musikkforlag AS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In an era without television or radio the theatre and the parlor piano were the entertainment options for a family. As silent movies grew in popularity it was a sure thing that Tin Pan Alley would jump on the bandwagon and write topical songs about going to the movies as well as songs written for the silent movies' scores played on everything from a single piano to a theatre organ to a full orchestra. Popular songs on the subject of moving pictures were an international phenomenon from about 1900 through the coming of sound in the late 1920s, and constitute a body of work that has yet to be fully documented and examined.

How would performers from other cultures respond musically to traditional Norwegian music from Setesdal, and how would Norwegian artists respond to the musical response from the outside world? The initiators Kirsten Braten Berg, Sigurd Brokke, Gunnar Stubseid and Hallvard T. Bjorgum wanted to figure out how different instruments from different countries and parts of the world would affect the original material, and what tonal and rhythmical challenges and opportunities this encounter would produce in the search of a new soundscape? The process was based on video and sound recordings of Norwegian folk musicians that had been forwarded to every corner of the world, to pick up musical response. Through an interactive process with portable studios and new digital technology, the musicians have been able to work together on the material though physically distanced. In addition, the collaboration has been continued through personal meetings, seminars and workshops. Every tune on the record has evolved into a unique piece of music, in many of the cases far away from the original material. What initially could seem like a stiff research project at the university has become a fabulous and innovative pioneering work that's unparalleled.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=HCD7324&medium=phy,30 World/Int'l.,World,,,Grappa Musikkforlag AS,Grappa Musikkforlag AS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Beethoven finally named it "Sinfonia Eroica" (Italian for Heroic Symphony) "composed in honor of a great man." The great work is paired with the Valses nobles et sentimentales by Maurice Ravel. From its title, in which two Waltz cycles by Schubert are mentioned (Valses Nobles and Valses Sentimentales), it is clear that it was Ravel's intention to compose a sequence of waltzes based on Schubert.

Written in 1942 and performed for the first time in 1946, the "Divertimento for Woodwind Quartet" is structured in 4 movements. Some aspects attest to the clear influence of Falla, and the use of rhythmic and harmonic pedal notes owes an obvious debt to Stravinsky, charting an aesthetic line close to Neoclassicism. The "Concert pour le jour de l'an" ("Concert for the Day of the Year"), for Harp and Woodwind is an expanded version of the "Concerto in E flat" that Bacarisse wrote in 1954 for the same combination of instruments which was subsequently reorchestrated in 1961 under the same title ("Concert pour le jour de l'an") but in this case with the orchestration increased to "for Harp and Orchestra".

In jazz, some profit and some play, giving into creative reexploration, a movement that began in the 80s with neo-boppers. Here, the five members of Soul Voyage opted for a certain simplicity, avoiding the acrobatic melodies of bebop. Soul jazz, as they see it, looked for the freshness and efficiency found in gospel and blues as opposed to the hard bop of the fifties. Its greatest period, from 1960 until 1975, featured such musicians as the Hammond B3 king Jimmy Smith, Horace Silver, Lonnie Liston Smith, Lou Donaldson, John Patton, Richard "Groove" Holmes, Grant Green and the Adderly Brothers among others. Soul Voyage have known each other for quite a while, Michel Mainil and Antoine Cirri on one side and Olivier Poumay and Vincent Romain on the other.

Founded in 1980 and based in Bloomington, Indiana, the choir is known for its commitment to new music and has premiered over 150 works. Five of their commissions are featured here. Of Radiance and Refraction, their debut album, demonstrates the wealth of talent found in the student ensemble led by Dominick DiOrio, as well as the remarkable works written for them by composition teachers at the Indiana University Jacobs School of Music, some tackling choral music for the first time. The album is anchored by John Gibson's substantial work for chorus and electronics, In Flight. His music is paradoxically dark and brooding, light and airy, witty and sardonic. While Icarus is already drowning and half submerged in Brueghel's painting of the same name, Gibson's first movement paints the entire story: an opening pastoral scene transforms into the movement of melting 'wing's wax,' with Icarus' death 'quite unnoticed' by the surrounding folk. The goldfinch of the second poem is drawn with harmony out of jazz and sound effects reminiscent of white noise, while the third poem's constellations swim through a more molecular and symmetrical harmonic world. The fourth movement moves toward the most fulfilling cathartic peak on the word "love"- a love which is short-lived, as the emotional crash of the poet is met with music of equal divisiveness. The fifth movement concludes the set with an atmosphere of smog and metal, of stuttering voices and desolate remains.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=INN002&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,,,2018 Dominick DiOrio,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Seven of these poems form the bulk of the libretto, interwoven with excerpts from Soyinka's plays, interviews, lectures and speeches; they reflect his upbringing in an environment of tolerance and condemn the current climate of intolerance, bigotry, and violence. The result is a concert-length choral 'oratorio' for clarinet, string quartet, and 24-voice choir, commissioned and performed by The Crossing, conducted by Donald Nally and winner of the 2018 Grammy Award for Best Choral Performance. Soyinka's texts and McLoskey's responses are universal pleas for peace and tolerance, yet they force us to look into the mirror and recognize the thin line between devotion and intolerance, zealotry and radicalism- themes that dominate our public discourse every day. Wole Soyinka is a Nigerian poet, playwright, novelist, and recipient of the 1986 Nobel Prize for Literature, the first African American recipient of the award. Throughout the set of canticles, Soyinka makes universal pleas for peace from multiple languages and religious cultures. Seven of these poems form the core of the libretto of Zealot Canticles.

Their composing is transparent and uncliched; their improvising provided with a remarkable coherence and openness. And perhaps it is exactly this - a fresh collective unity that keeps their respective personalities and idiosyncrasies intact - that brings them success in this bold and collaborative performance.

The first work, 'Le palais du silence,' refers to an unrealized ballet project of Claude Debussy. Ronchetti refers to the attempts of Debussy to transfer "silent landscapes" into sound. As part of this process his music can be heard on numerous occasions thoughout this piece. In 'Helicopters and butterflies' the composer refers to Dostoyevsky´s novel "The Gambler." It is a "mikro-musictheater-project" for a solo percussionist, who finds himself in a lonely hotel room with over 80 musical items, and starts telling a musical story about losing and winning. The piece 'Forward and downward, turning neither to the left nor to the right' is an "instrumental opera" for solo cello where mythological stories are told, e.g. Theseus, who enters the Labyrinth of Knossos and tries to escape with the help of a thread, given to him by his beloved Ariadne. In 'Lacus timoris, lake of fear' the solo-percussionist gazes at the kettledrum skins with his ears closely above them, same as Narzissus gazes at his reflection in the lake. Shortly before the end of the piece, the percussionist sings Handels famous aria Lascia ch´io pianga into the kettledrum skins at a barely audible volume. 'Rumori da monumenti' for chamber ensemble and voice are "postcards" from a far-distant world.

For any lover of classical music, the name itself is evocative of orchestral color, broad, sweeping symphonic brushstrokes and the culmination of the romantic symphony. However, Mahler wrote with equal mastery in another genre: His oeuvre is remarkable in that he virtually wrote in two genres alone, namely symphony and song. What is more, there were few composers for whom the two genres were so closely connected: Mahler would often reuse material from songs in symphonies, and some claim that these self-quotations are keys to secret programmes in the symphonies. Most important of all is the fact that all of his mature songs were written both with orchestral accompaniment and as songs for piano and voice. In one of his final masterpieces, Das Lied von der Erde, he combined the two into a symphonic song cycle. Where does this leave the piano version? Are these mere reductions? One might ascribe commercial reasons for their creation: in Mahler's time, a reduced arrangement was the only way the works could be heard outside the concert hall, and a piano reduction would be the easiest to sell. This, however, gives too little credit to the pieces. In fact, the attention to detail given in them shows that they were written to be performed as equals in either form. After all, since it would be in this form that most people would have the opportunity to hear them, it was important that these versions were as strong as they could possibly be.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=LWC1157&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,,2018 Lawo Classics,2018 Lawo Classics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The artists write: "Saxophone and organ sound good together and complement each other well, yet little music has been written for this instrumental combination. For this reason, we are always looking for music that works well and often it is music written for instruments other than our own.

His love, longing and heartache for his wife, Allison (who passed 35 days before David) is displayed in Movement One of Symphony No. 10. His admiration, love, and respect for his son, Matthew, shines in Movement Two. David's compassion and his plea for peace and tolerance for all life and cultures, we hear in "Hymn for World Peace." His spirituality can be heard in UFO Dreams." David had the great gift of being able to channel emotions into music. David's untimely passing in August of 2017 was a huge loss for the world of wind music. His 10th Symphony was not completed at the time of his passing. His son, Matthew, took the sketches and notes his father left him and completed this masterwork in time for the World Premiere in Salt Lake City on April 3, 2018.

Duke unveils more of his early experiments with the ARP synthesizer, as well as a new creativity on such more conventional keyboards, as the Wurlitzer, Fender Rhodes, and the clavinet. As a result, "Faces in Reflection" is characterized by a wide variety of tonal hues. The journey moves from the explosive "The Opening" on to the tender-tinged "Capricorn", which Duke had snatched from the Cannonball Adderley repertoire. Adderley had been the second major player he had worked with during that early period; Frank Zappa was the first. Two impressionistic solo intermezzi segue into the funky fusion escapade "Psychosomatic Dung", with superb interplay between drummer "Ndugu" and bassist John Heard. The title piece's secretive synth lines are the moments of calm before Duke's passionate love affair with Brazil on the B side. The most surprising excursion on this side is the vibrant and rhythmically intricate adaptation of Milton Nascimentos' "Maria Três Filhos", counterbalanced by the synth laboratory of "North Beach". Duke himself cherished the recordings; he stated that, "This was the first LP that really said what I wanted to say."",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=0212855MSW&medium=phy,02 Jazz,Jazz,,Germany,2018 Edel Germany GmbH,2018 Edel Germany GmbH,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Once again he shows a discernable vocal development. In "Tryin' And Cryin" the Californian together with rock singer Napoleon Brock overlay multiple vocal tracks. On "Seeing You" Duke lays on a glaze of soulful tenderness, whereas "What The..." is 30 seconds of frivolous funning around. "Back to Where We Never Left" is a witty gem in which Duke bundles his pool of synthesizers into a united groove, whereas "I C'n Hear That" shows off synth and marimba tonal colors in dialogue, with the bass riffing on the bottom. The album flows into the final bend carrying along the sonorous richness of Brazil. "After the Love" plays with the languorous erotic colors of the tropics, whereas all the band members are allowed to shine on the epic circa ten minute title track with its hot samba flair: the rhythm section with ""Ndugu"", Al Johnson, and Airto Moreira's percussion arsenal, Daryl Stuermer with his rock interludes on guitar, and Duke himself with inspired virtuosity on all sorts of synths and keyboards.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=0212859MSW&medium=phy,02 Jazz,Jazz,,Germany,2018 Edel Germany GmbH,2018 Edel Germany GmbH,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Beginning in April of that year, Duke made two recordings over a short timespan that on their release in 1973 as a double LP (against the desire of the artists, by the way), would be a major statement. On Chapter One of his fusion autobiography, "Solus", Duke, along with the skeleton crew of bassist John Heard and drummer Dick Berk, tries out the new compositional philosophy he had absorbed from his work with Adderley. The album was obliged to maintain a jazzy environment, illustrated by the harmonically flowing piano improvisation on "Love Reborn" and the bop-influenced busyness of "The Followers". But the record also signifies the importance of the keyboards in all their diverse contexts - the funky rock of "Au-right", and the smoldering, dreamy feel of "Peace", for instance. And on "Manya" Duke lives it up as he shows off his exuberant experimental synth side. "The Inner Source" continues in the same vein. "So There You Go" is a downright delightful waltz featuring e-piano, whereas "Some Time Ago" is pure tonal color and atmosphere. We find an exotic gem in "Nigerian Numberumba" in which an African Lamellophone is craftily simulated with an echoplex and ring modulator. Duke also begins to vary the lineup here. ""Feels So Good"" and ""My Soul"" are reinforced with Latin percussion, and incisive horn and reed instruments (luminaries from the Thad Jones and Santana entourages). The same with the title track, a masterstroke of quintet dramaturgy, with Duke on his first instrument, the trombone. As a curiosity, two basses compete with each other on "Twenty Five". The last piece, "Always Constant", is a more open piece that spontaneously unfolded in the studio.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=0212854MSW&medium=phy,02 Jazz,Jazz,,Germany,2018 Edel Germany GmBH,2018 Edel Germany GmbH,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With Santana drummer Leon "Ndugu" Chancler, bassist Alphonso "Slim" Johnson, and the Brazilian percussion magician Airto Moriera, Duke designed stunning scenarios in sound which once more reveals him to be one of the synthesizer pioneers. On "Dawn" he paints a fanciful daybreak atmosphere on the keyboards. On "Floop De Loop" he releases funky rushing rivulets from the keyboards. Whereas on the smooth rock piece "For Love" and soft ballad "Fools", he appears on the scene as a soulful singer. There's something slightly naughty coursing through the bluesy, laid-back funk miniature, "Foosh". Duke's former collaboration with the Mothers of Invention colored his versions of Zappa's "Echidna's Arf" and "Uncle Remus". There's a samba touch in the relaxed tropical magic of "Malibu", and the outro "The Aura" also swings to a Latin feel.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=0212858MSW&medium=phy,02 Jazz,Jazz,,Germany,2018 Edel Germany GmbH,2018 Edel Germany GmbH,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As before, drummer Leon "Ndugu" Chancler beats as the heart of the rhythm section, and the Brazilian couple, Airto and Flora are again on board. The ten tracks perform a stylistic balancing act. The jittery funk of "Chariot" and the smooth ballad "Someday" show off Duke's soulful vocal flair. Flora Purim crowns the complex "Look Into Her Eyes" with her spheric sound as she and guitarist George Johnson take care of business on this stratospheric piece with its bluesy electric shuffle. With two high-voltage guitarists (Daryl Stuermer and Byron Miller), "That's What She Said" points to the tie between rock and funk. The most eye-opening outing occurs with star guitarist Lee Ritenour stomping on "Rokkinrowl, I Don't Know", and its Hendrix parody. "Sister Sirene" shows that, naturally, the typical dreamy Duke instrumentals are not left off the album. An almost animistic soundscape is woven into the fabric of "Mashavu", and "Giant Child Within Us - Ego" is a small fusion suite encompassing the spectrum from the classical to the Zappaesque finale. The title piece is indeed a blues, dished out pure and simple - a far cry from the sounds of the preceeding piece with its mountains of synthesizers. Rather, the sultry delta heat, the acoustic simplicity and raw truth of the song prevail - the blues.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=0212857MSW&medium=phy,02 Jazz,Jazz|Fusion,,Germany,2018 Edel Germany GmbH,2018 Edel Germany GmbH,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The keyboard master ventures deep into his synthesizer laboratory. Their textures become a more essential component of his pieces, attaining orchestral dimensions, as evidenced in the opener, "Funny Funk", with its smacking, squishing tongue-in-cheek dialogue between the synths. A virtuoso layering of the keyboards is also central to "Cora Joberge", and on "Rashid", Duke's electronic orchestra explodes over the stormy drums of Leon "Ndugu" Chancler. Duke shows himself to be a singer with a soulful sound. Shortly before this recording he had shelved his trombone so that he could communicate more directly with the audience, as can be heard in the hymnal, dreamlike title piece. The guest list of players make for an especially exciting concoction. No less than Duke's playing companion Frank Zappa, under the cryptic pseudonym Obdewl'l X, performs some adventuresome guitar passages on "Love" and "Old Slippers". On the California-sunshine pop samba, "Yana Aminah", we have a surprise visit by Brazilian Flora Purim, wife of percussionist Airto Moreira, who opens up his bag of tricks on "The Once Over", and plays on three more tracks.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=0212856MSW&medium=phy,02 Jazz,Jazz|Fusion,,Germany,2018 Edel Germany GmbH,2018 Edel Germany GmbH,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As the ambassador of a new generation he simply can't be pigeonholed as representing this or that genre. He connects worlds: as soloist with internationally renowned ensembles, and equally as a performer at mass-media events like Miss World or Miss Earth, the Milan EXPO or Paris Fashion Week. He has long been a TV star in East Asia with regular television appearances, commercial advertising contracts and "trending topic" status on Twitter. In his new project Mercy, Iskandar Widjaja presents a broad musical spectrum with a closely interwoven thematic structure, summing up his achievement to date and opening a new phase of his life. Mercy begins with an improvisation on the composition "River Flows In You" by the South Korean pianist Yiruma. The British composer Max Richter, whose habitual field of operations is the electronic, ambient and film score scene, contributes the title track "Mercy". A quiet, almost meditative work for piano and violin, it is framed by congenial segments with works by Arvo Part and Johann Sebastian Bach. Long-time friends and associates - like the Italian electronic music artist Giordano Franchetti, who created a sound synthesis with NASA "space sounds", or pianist Friedrich Wengler, whom Widjaja has known since his schooldays -accompany him on his new album. The greatest challenge proved to be the piece "Eneril" in which the vocal part was taken by Mongolian singer Urna Chahar-Tugchi, who grew up in a shepherd family in the grasslands of Ordos. The result is a track that is Iskandar Widjaja all over: wandering between worlds, never without a homeland, being at home everywhere.

Now he releases his debut album on the Neue Meister label. Metcalfe has always been surrounded by music. As a child, he would listen to his father sing opera, before a love of Kraftwerk and Joy Division led to a stint as a drummer in a high school band. But it was a move to Manchester that really accelerated his development as an artist, and led to him finding his true calling. Joining cult band The Durutti Column, then signed to legendary label Factory Records, brought him into the orbit of Tony Wilson and the Hacienda, formative events that would help foster his renegade spirit. Unimpressed with the strictures demanded by the classical recording industry, Metcalfe persuaded Wilson to launch the ground-breaking Factory Classical Label, aimed at unearthing exciting - and unconventional - new British talent. It was here that Metcalfe found a home, and the group that would come to define his musical career; the Duke Quartet. For nearly 30 years, they've existed at the vanguard of contemporary British music, innovating and delighting in equal measure. Working with world-renowned artists across the entire cultural spectrum, from pop, dance, film, TV, and theatre, Metcalfe honed his arranging and producing skills; he's now one of the UK's most sought after arrangers, regularly working with some of biggest names in music. As a solo artist, Metcalfe explores electro-classical soundscapes and the boundaries between genres. His finely tuned compositions are neat yet grand in scale, both in terms of sound and the conceptual ideas underpinning them.

Through long rehearsals, workshops, performances, and tours, these pieces have become companions and friends of the quartet, a central and personal part of their repertoire. Praised by the Washington Post for "captivating" performances that draw from its notable "meld of intellect, technique and emotions," the Aizuri Quartet was awarded the Grand Prize at the 2018 M Prize Chamber Arts Competition, First Prize at the 2017 Osaka International Chamber Music Competition in Japan, and Third Prize at the 2015 Wigmore Hall International Chamber Music Competition in London. Through its engaging and thought-provoking programs, the Quartet has garnered critical acclaim for bringing "a technical bravado and emotional power" to bold new commissions, and for its "flawless" (San Diego Union-Tribune) performances of the great masterpieces of the past in which "every note is lovingly crafted and savored" (Washington Post). Based in New York City, the Aizuri Quartet was the 2017-2018 MetLiveArts String Quartet-in-Residence at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, presenting five unique programs throughout the season, which the New York Times called "genuinely exciting" and "imaginative.""

Trapani found himself reaching towards the music of the deep South, particularly Delta Blues, and exploring ways to incorporate stylistic elements into his own work.

Performers include Talea Ensemble, Longleash Trio, pianist Marilyn Nonken, and JACK Quartet. Christopher Trapani writes: "Home is the pull of a tonic chord. Home is the warm glow of consonance, radiating through a hissing layer of noise. Home is a worn and familiar sonority, the drone of loose strings. A loop back to the downbeat, a refrain falling into place after another meandering verse. Take a few steps away, then circle back.

Both the Flute and Violin Concertos were composed for soloists with whom he already had a close working relationship. Adam Walker is the principal flautist for the London Symphony Orchestra, who Watkins describes as having an 'amazing sound and control of his instrument'. The delicate orchestration in the Flute Concerto allows the solo flute to take flight as it weaves in and out with skittish motifs. Alina Ibragimova is the soloist in the Violin Concerto, premiered at the BBC Proms in 2010. The piece harnesses Ibragimova's dynamic and intense, fiercely intelligent playing, switching from attacking virtuosity and molten lyricism, often in an instant. The result is dramatic and utterly compelling. In this album's liner notes, Steph Power writes that Watkins has 'long seemed a symphonist in waiting, with a natural affinity for big-boned yet finely-wrought drama'. Cast in two movements, Huw Watkins' Symphony does not strictly adhere to classical symphonic form. Rather, the composer interprets this great tradition through his development of ideas and use of the orchestra.

The title track A Brief History of Creation, commissioned by The Halle Concerts Society for its Children's Choir, is a fantastic romp through 14 billion years of history, from cell division (the choir reduced to one single, tiny voice) to dinosaurs, sharks, monkeys and finally to man. The Guardian said of its premiere in 2016 "Dove has a remarkable aptitude for writing music that is challenging to sing, stimulating to listen to, yet simple to remember. The outstanding Halle Children's Choir covered almost 14 billion years entirely from memory." Inspiration for the piece was sparked by a visit to a James Turrell art installation. ""It gave me the feeling of looking through space to the first stars: it started children's voices singing in my mind's ear, surrounded by twinkling percussion. I found myself wondering about the beginning of the universe ... I thought it would be fun to sing about the birth of the Earth and the beginning of life"", Dove explains. Dove and the librettist Alasdair Middleton picked ""the best bits of the story"" and the children perform it on this live recording with gusto. Gaia Theory was inspired by a trip Dove took to the Arctic - a project called Cape Farewell, organized to allow artists to witness climate change first-hand. Dove says the experience woke him up to the speed and scale of changes taking place: on return, he wondered how it might be possible 'to write about this without finger-wagging'. Dove turned to the work of scientist James Lovelock, who developed the idea that the Earth behaves as a self-regulating organism, which always maintains a balance favorable for life. Lovelock himself describes this relationship as a dance, making it natural for Dove to set to music. The resulting piece is a celebration of the resilience of life.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=NMCD233&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,United Kingdom,2018 NMC Recordings,2018 NMC Recordings,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

His music, with that of his contemporary Charles Villiers Stanford, brought his native land into the European musical mainstream, through its assimilation of continental--specifically German--models. This release situates Parry's music in its European context. Parry was a social and political liberal, and crucially--like all the leading British musicians of his time--his horizons extended beyond the island of his birth. His late set of six motets, Songs of Farewell, are among his greatest achievements in any musical genre, demonstrating his capacity for deeply affecting introspection. In this recording, they are prefaced by another sextet: the pithy Sechs Spruche by Mendelssohn, which make clear the debt Parry owed to his continental forebears and contemporaries. Moreover, this recording presents, for the first time, an early version of 'There is an old belief', edited by Robert Quinney from the autograph manuscripts in Oxford's Bodleian Library and a printed proof copy. The compositional history of the motet is unclear, but the evidence suggests Parry vacillated between two strikingly different versions of the section 'serene in changeless prime' until shortly before publication.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=NCR1394&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Choral,United Kingdom,New College Oxford,New College Oxford,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

That - along with his precociously mature and sonorously dark baritone - made him almost ageless, as in his Eugene Onegin under Kirill Petrenko (2010) or his Prince Yeletsky a year earlier in The Queen of Spades. Both roles were prime examples of the baritone's Russian repertoire. First comes bel canto like I Puritani with the 31-year-old singing under the baton of Placido Domingo and a duet as Figaro with the Count Almaviva of Michael Schade. Dmitri Hvorostovsky stands out above all on this album as a true Verdi baritone: as Posa (Don Carlos), for example, and in paternal roles. It is all for good, given their dramatic impact, that ensemble scenes dominate: the quartet in which Hvorostovsky plays Rigoletto alongside Patrizia Ciofi, Ramon Vargas and Donna Ellen, or Hvorostovsky's Simon Boccanegra in the finale of Act I of Verdi's eponymous and all too rarely performed opera. By then, Hvorostovsky's cancer was far advanced and much of his singing lacks the effortlessness of decades earlier. But this is more than compensated for by the depth of his characterization, which makes us overlook any shortcomings elsewhere. The climax is his moving aria as Anckarstrom in the original Swedish version of Un ballo in maschera, in which he fears he has lost the love of his wife. It ends with the bitter-sweet resignation of "O dolcezze perdute, o speranze d'amor" (O sweet moments lost, O vain hopes of love).",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=ORF-C966181B&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Austria,2018 ORFEO International Music GmbH,2018 ORFEO International Music GmbH,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2018,ORFEO,ORF-C932182A,4011790932224,Leonard Bernstein; Erich Wolfgang Korngold; Miklos Rozsa ,Baiba Skride: American Concertos,Baiba Skride; Gothenburg Symphony; Tampere Philharmonic Orchestra,2,CD,31.19,47.99,""America, you are better off" - wrote Goethe in 1827, weary of German Romanticism and the "fruitless wrangling" of sterile debates. A century later, the New World experienced an unprecedented wave of migration consisting of leading figures, largely Jewish, from the cultural and intellectual spheres of German and Austrian life. The composers among them were attracted by the rich rewards that seemed to be on offer from the new world of sound film in Hollywood, but few were able to reap those rewards to the full: among those few, who were able to make their way in a competitive marketplace through pragmatism and perseverance, were Erich Wolfgang Korngold and Miklos Rozsa - both regularly nominated for Oscars and frequently successful. While making a living from this genre of "music drama", each of them -whether or not they were recognized by the classical music business - sought to push the limits of the traditional formats and were remarkably successful in doing so. Taking a phone call, Rozsa could scarcely believe that the legendary virtuoso really was seriously interested in his Violin Concerto and was ready to give the work its premiere - but so he did in 1956, and the first recording of the work, with its extreme technical challenges, was also made by Heifetz. And it had been just the same with the Violin Concerto by Korngold, Rozsa's senior by ten years: the 1947 premiere and the brilliant first recording of this twentieth-century classic again showcased Heifetz as soloist. In the new generation of genuinely American musicians, one outstanding figure was Leonard Bernstein, an all-rounder whose early success led on to even greater heights: here too, one can hardly ignore his contribution to film music, even if it amounts to one single film. Bernstein rated his Violin Concerto of 1954, "Serenade", inspired by Plato's Symposium, as his best work ever, and this work too in its imaginatively slimmed-down scoring for string orchestra, harp and percussion is now acknowledged to be an important 20th-century concerto for violin. As an "encore", this compilation includes the masterly Symphonic Dances from the immortal "West Side Story", which has long risen above the "fruitless wrangling" over "light" and "serious" music.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=ORF-C932182A&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Austria,2018 ORFEO International Music GmbH,2018 ORFEO International Music GmbH,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After exploring its labyrinth of secrets in several years of research, Fabrizio Cassol wanted to reframe the mournful ritual of the Requiem to express other emotions as well - such as joyfulness - transcended by music and dancing. He confided his wish to Alain Platel, who was immediately fired by the idea. The choice of musicians was key: the ensemble is made up of six singers, three likembes, accordion, guitar, bass, euphonium and percussion. The basic narrative and formal scheme of the original Requiem is retained: recognizable fragments from it are quoted in almost all the sections. Joy and intense exultation, the power of the 'groove' and profound incantations all meet and intermingle with polyphony from many different sources. Five African languages intertwine with the ancient Latin text, and invocations to the ancestors ring out, creating a unique journey towards the hereafter - a journey open to the reality of the world today.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=OUT663&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Classical Crossover,Austria,2018 7 Wheels,2018 Outhere,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Addie has no idea why her father resents the holidays so intensely, refusing even to allow a Christmas tree in the house. But when she brings home a tree she won in a school contest, it paves the way for a miracle of sorts--her father's broken soul is transformed. The House without a Christmas Tree, a new opera by Ricky Ian Gordon and Royce Vavrek that premiered at Houston Grand Opera in 2017, is based on the book by Gail Rock and the beloved 1972 television movie of the same name. Ricky Ian Gordon (b. 1956 in Oceanside, NY) studied piano, composition and acting, at Carnegie Mellon University. After moving to New York City, he quickly emerged as a leading writer of vocal music that spans art song, opera, and musical theater. Mr. Gordon's songs have been performed and or recorded by such internationally renowned singers as Renee Fleming, Dawn Upshaw, Judy Collins, Kelli O'Hara, Audra MacDonald, Kristin Chenoweth, Andrea Marcovicci, and the late Lorraine Hunt Lieberson, among many others. Royce Vavrek is a Canada-born, Brooklyn-based librettist and lyricist who has been called "the indie Hofmannsthal" (The New Yorker) a "Metastasio of the downtown opera scene" (The Washington Post), "an exemplary creator of operatic prose" (The New York Times), and "one of the most celebrated and sought after librettists in the world" (CBC Radio).

Richard Strauss' Schlagobers (Whipped Cream, 1924) is a playful ballet set in a Viennese Konditorei, of which the orchestral suite is featured on this album. With its lively mix of Viennese waltzes and modern harmonies, light-versed tunes interspersed by sudden outbreaks of ravishing beauty, all brilliantly orchestrated, it can be considered a further exploration of the composer's "Rosenkavalier style". Claude Debussy is featured with Jeux, Poeme danse (1912), another piece created for a ballet performance, built around an erotic nocturnal search for a lost tennis ball that Pierre Boulez characterized as a "Prelude à-l'Apres-midi d'une Faune in sports clothes". Debussy's Jeux has been a major source of inspiration for post-war avantgarde composers such as Boulez and Stockhausen, and, therefore, the transition from Jeux to Gyorgi Ligeti's Melodien, fur Orchester (1971) is not jarring. Melodien has the unmistakable mix of sensuous yet eerie soundscapes that makes most of Ligeti's works so filmic and appealing. This album adds a significant chapter to the Pentatone discography of the Orchestre de la Suisse Romande, which already contains the complete Bruckner Symphonies with Marek Janowski, three dance-oriented albums with Kazuki Yamada, and concerto recordings with renowned soloists such as Arabella Steinbacher, Johannes Moser and Denis Kozhukhin.

The late Romantic edition's detailed performance instructions -- including fingering, dynamics, phrasing, articulation, and registration -- make it a seminal milestone in the performance history of Bach's organ works. Dean Billmeyer breathes new life into this significant edition, performing the pieces at historic organs built by Wilhelm Sauer. The two instruments heard on this album were completed shortly after the turn of the century: they have retained their original condition and boast an impressively beautiful sound. With great technical skill and sensibility, Dean Billmeyer masterfully transports his audience into the early years of the twentieth century and gives insight into the period's understanding of Bach's music. The organist gives listeners an impression of what Bach sounded like when the Romantic era was still the present and had only just begun to become history. Billmeyer is appointed professor at the University of Minnesota. At this university he is the successor of Heinrich Fleischer, a disciple of Karl Staube.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=ROP614546&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Baroque Era,Germany,2018 Rondeau Production,2018 Rondeau Production,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Stanford came late to the string quartet form, composing his first two in 1891. His Third Quartet followed five years later. Dedicated to "my friends the Joachim Quartet," it moves from stern agitation and lyrical poise to introspective intensity before ending with a ferocious, dance-like finale. As Stanford authority Jeremy Dibble notes: "The idiom of the string quartet was always a serious intellectual challenge for Stanford and this example is no exception in its demonstration of structural subtlety, thematic imagination and brilliant ensemble writing." Completed a decade later, the Fourth Quartet is a work of fierce technical challenges - "brimfull with invention" as Dibble pithily observes - its playful Scherzo a dazzling example of Stanford's love of continuing variation, the melancholic slow movement and virtuoso finale drawing deep from the Dublin-born composer's richly emotional Irish heritage. The Seventh Quartet is one of Stanford's most varied and vital exercises in the form. Viola and cello are pitched against each other in the stern, contrapuntal dialogue of its first movement with a tour de force Scherzo at its heart and a finale that dances delightfully in irregular phrase lengths to end in an energetic flourish. Issued in late 2016, Volume One in the series was admired as "an excellent album in every respect" (MusicWeb International), applauded as "most enterprising and thoroughly likeable" (Classical Ear) and acclaimed "a really worthwhile release" (Gramophone).",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=SOMMCD%200185&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,EU,2018 Somm Recordings,2018 Somm Recordings,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Hills of Dreamland takes its title from a line in Elgar's well-known setting, beautifully still and beseeching, of Arthur L Salmon's Pleading. Historically the least regarded part of Elgar's output, his songs contain a treasure-trove of vocal gems and here receive performances of insight, imagination and emotional directness. The Op.59 Song Cycle is an exemplary case in point, by turns quietly radiant, touchingly nostalgic and achingly melancholic. Two settings of poems by Elgar's wife - the richly orchestrated The Wind at Dawn and celebratory The King's Way- show Elgar at his most evocative and ebullient. Sombre and powerful, The Pipes of Pan boasts colorful imagery and driving rhythmic energy, The River and The Torch wholly Elgarian in their wonderful sonorities. A first recording of the orchestral version of the marching song Follow the Colours shows Elgar at his most patriotic. The complete incidental music for a 1901 staging of WB Yeats' Grania and Diarmid offers a rare opportunity to experience the full gamut of Elgar's moving and dramatic evocation of a timeless tale of love in the ancient Irish myth. A bonus album of recordings made under the auspices of the Elgar Society showcases soprano Nathalie de Montmollin and pianist Barry Collett in a collection of piano-accompanied songs. It includes first recordings of the piano version of 'Winter' from The Mill Wheel and the world-weary tread of Muleteer's Serenade, setting words from Cervantes' Don Quixote.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=SOMMCD%20271-2&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,EU,2018 Somm Recordings,2018 Somm Recordings,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While securing permanent shelter--a home--has become a goal for the majority of individuals in our world, migration remains one of our main strategies for survival. Today, tens of millions of individuals live a nomadic lifestyle as hunter gatherers or pastoralists. Pilgrims seek moral or spiritual significance through extended physical journeys. Immigrants and refugees seek freedom, stability, and safety in a new community or country. Whether physical or metaphysical, humanity survives by way of continuous movement--our culture, beliefs, and histories are marked by impermanence. Music functions as a container of meaning, a vehicle we have used for centuries to express and grapple with the ineffable. We want to capture music--to write it down with a notation that clearly defines and preserves our musical ideas for generations to come. Yet, we have struggled to create a collection of symbols that can fully express our intentions--intentions that go far beyond pitch and rhythm. With this evolution came an ever-expanding musical vocabulary, new levels of complexity, and an increased desire to prescribe performance practices with the pen. But music resists this containment--the possibilities precede and outlast the technology that seeks to write them down. The repertoire on this album is rife with symbolism and metaphor that further teases out concepts of impermanence, migration, and the transient nature of musical language. From the wordless vocalises of Takemitsu's Windhorse depicting Tibetan nomads, to the 12th century polyphony of the Codex Calixtinus sung by pilgrims traveling along the Camino de Santiago, to the dramatic shifts of polyphonic style seen in the 15th century motets of Du Fay and the Turin Manuscript, to Peter Gilbert's contemporary meditation on the phases of the moon--temporality is a common and unmistakable thread",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=DSL-92226&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Choral,United States,2018 Sono Luminus,2018 Sono Luminus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

His first recording for Steinway, Siegfried Idyll, was critically acclaimed in the New York Times and Gramophone, and was listed as one of the year's ten best classical albums by the Boston Globe in 2015. Mr. Deveau now brings us intimate chamber versions of Mozart's delightful Piano Concerto No. 14 and Beethoven's lyrical Piano Concerto No. 4. Deveau writes: "The genre 'concerto' pits soloist against orchestra in a sort of cooperative struggle, a contest between the individual and the larger forces of the ensemble. In the waning days of the 18th century, the rise of public, ticketed concerts inspired composers to write concerti that would both show off the soloist's and composer's virtuosity in a large concert venue. Mozart spent much of the 1780s presenting such works at subscription concerts in Vienna, performing the solo parts, conducting the orchestra from the keyboard, and improvising cadenzas on the spot. Many of these concerti became instantly popular, and absent radio or recordings in that era, people wanted to play the works in their homes. The 'a quattro' version, for soloist and string quartet, was thus born... In the performance on this recording of the 14th concerto, K449, I have taken the liberty of adding bass to the ensemble as it gives a more orchestral sensibility. Mozart left cadenzas for a number of the concerti, and I play his originals here."",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=STNS30099&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Instrumental,United States,2018 Steinway Musical Instruments,2018 Steinway Musical Instruments,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For these "creative arrangements" it was hard to choose which songs from so many popular melodies and chamber arias. It was inevitable to leave out some favorites. And so we have masterpieces such as 'Torna a Surriento,' 'Cannetella,' and 'Marechiare;' But (I hope) the absence of the famous 'O sole mio, Malafermmena,' or 'Fenesta vascia' is compensated by featuring some absolute gems that remain unjustly hidden..."

As he himself put it, his aim was to create music rooted in his country, music for educated listeners. Although he also drew inspiration from 20th-century classics, Kalabis arrived at a synthetic style of his own, an alternative to the rational compositional techniques - a Neo-Romantic alternative, akin to Neo-Classicism. Besides the first ever album of Kalabis's complete piano oeuvre, Ivo Kahanek and other leading Czech instrumentalists have recorded the composer's three sonatas. The one for cello reflects the dramatic events in Czechoslovakia between June and September 1968: the months of euphoria of the Prague Spring, followed by disillusionment and resignation in the wake of the Warsaw Pact's invasion, which for two decades to come would numb all hopes of freedom. The clarinet sonata (1969) too clearly refers to the time of its coming into being: drama, grief and sorrow, escalated into harrowing helplessness. The elliptical and coherent violin sonata (1982) places emphasis on the instrument's typical ethos - melodiousness, bright sound and soulfulness. After 3 albums featuring Kalabis's symphonies and concertos, the present recording affords yet another insight into the composer's musical universe.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=SU4210-2&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Czech Republic,2018 Supraphon a.s.,2018 Supraphon a.s.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus read a Viennese critic's review of Winterreise, a true masterpiece published in the final year of the composer's life. Enthralled by the verse of Wilhelm Muller (1794-1827), Schubert slightly changed the order of the poems so as to make a story - of a wanderer, a homeless man, unrequited in love and disappointed by the whole word. A tale that has always prompted questions as to what degree it reflects the personal experiences of the two artists, the poet and the musician, coevals whose lives ended too soon. The motif of a vagrant, an outcast loner, was characteristic of 19th-century Romanticism, yet it seems to resonate with the feeling of solitude of those living today. Possessing a robust, colorful voice, the bass Jan Martinik inheres an immense sensitivity for expressing the intimacy of Schubert's songs. He has proved his calibre by having attained success at international competitions, as well as by having performed to great acclaim on major opera stages. Following his Supraphon debut, Martinik has recorded Winterreise, splendidly accompanied on the piano by David Marecek.

In particular, the magazine praised Jordan's approach of combining the classic Viennese sound with a more modern, leaner interpretation, original tempos and insights from historically informed performance. For Jordan, the content of the music was paramount. His goal was not to revere Beethoven as a monument but rather to present him in a more "natural, direct and personal" way.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=WS015&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Orchestral,Austria,2018 Wiener Symphoniker,2018 Wiener Symphoniker,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2018,Willowhayne Records,WHR054,0643824049116,Claude Debussy; Federico Mompou; Maurice Ravel; Alexander Scriabin ,"Mikhail Shilyaev Plays Debussy, Mompou, Ravel & Scriabin",Mikhail Shilyaev ,1,CD,14.81,22.99,"Mikhail Shilyaev was born in Izhevsk, Russia. He started learning piano at the age of six and won several regional piano competitions at a young age. He studied in Russia, Germany, and in the UK. As a soloist with orchestra, he has recently performed with Musikkollegium Winterthur, the London Soloists Chamber Orchestra, RNCM Concert Orchestra, the Gregorian Philharmonic Orchestra and with the Gulbenkian Symphony Orchestra. Mikhail lives in London and plays mostly in the UK and Europe. He is interested in historical performance practice and often gives recitals on fortepianos. The choice of instrument for this recording is the result of Mikhail's personal fascination with the spirit of fin de siècle, that period when so many musical styles emerged, coexisted, fused and challenged each other. It was an era in which the art of piano playing truly blossomed, and fortunately for us, the newly emerged recording technology documented and preserved this blossoming. The works on this release (with the exception of Mompou's Variations) were composed around the time this particular Bechstein was being built. So the pianistic sound worlds of Debussy, Ravel, Scriabin and Mompou are reflected in the sound world of this, their contemporary instrument.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=WHR054&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Piano,United Kingdom,2018 Willowhayne Records,2018 Willowhayne Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2018,Zefir Records,ZEF9657,8717774570517,Dick Kattenburg; Dmitri Shostakovich; Max Vredenburg; Mieczyslaw Weinberg ,Asdis Valdimarsdottir: Voice of the Viola in Times of Oppression,Asdis Valdimarsdottir; Marcel Worms ,1,CD,14.81,22.99,"The viola is surely not the most assertive instrument among the string family. It reaches neither the extreme height of the violin nor the rumbling depth and the strength of the cello and contrabass. Its role is more integrating than leading or polarizing; and in brilliance, maneuverability and sound projection the violin wins hands down. But if a composer wants to express his feelings with maximum intensity and depth, he chooses the viola remarkably often. The loss of a loved one, a repressive political system, persecution and war were more than once the motivation for the composing of music with the viola as the most important voice for expressing the underlying emotions. The dark, somewhat veiled sound of the instrument makes it particularly suited to such a role. The Polish-Russian Jewish composer Mieczyslaw Weinberg fled during the Nazi invasion. Dick Kattenburg was picked up in 1944 during a razzia and he died, only 24 years old, in Auschwitz. Max Vredenburg, being a Jewish artist, fled from the Nazis in 1941 to Indonesia but was there interned in a camp. Shostakovich's Sonata for viola and piano was his last composition. Notwithstanding that the pressures of the Soviet regime on the composer did not lead to his banishment or even his liquidation, the last stages of Shostakovich's life were far from uncomplicated. In all of these works, we see the viola utilized as the outlet of their suffering.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=ZEF9657&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Instrumental,Netherlands,2018 Zefir Records,2018 Zefir Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2018,Zefir Records,ZEF9659,8717774570531,Robert Schumann ,""...und ein Kuss auf dein Herz" - Myrten, Op. 25 & 4 Duets by Robert Schumann",Florieke Beelen; Hans Pieter Herman; Maurice Lammerts van Bueren ,1,CD,14.81,22.99,"Schumann wrote 26 songs and called them "Myrten," which means "Myrtles," as a wedding gift to Clara Wieck. Schumann, who grew up between piles of books in his father's bookstore, had developed a diverse taste in literature, and in Myrten his choice of poetry is not only adventurous, but above all remarkable. All texts of the cycle are in German, but three of the poets are English, Scottish or Irish: Lord Byron, Robert Burns, and Thomas Moore. Most English texts Schumann used for his Myrten were translated by Wilhelm Gerhard, a German salesman and poet, who lived in Leipzig and was friendly with many leading poets and composers. The other poems are written by Goethe, Ruckert and Heine, who are each represented in several songs. Only one text, which inspired Schumann to write one of his most beloved songs, was written by Julius Mosen: Der Nussbaum.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGOJVMR7t1E,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=ZEF9659&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Vocal,Netherlands,2018 Zefir Records,2018 Zefir Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
