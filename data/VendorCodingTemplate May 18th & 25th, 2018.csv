The result is Polarity, an album based on both new and older compositions of mine, recorded in a unique acoustic setting.” Polarity has been conceived as a cohesive experience where the compositions themselves, the moments of spontaneous inspiration during performance and the natural sound world of the church acoustics all affect the final result. The compositions are inspired by actual experiences and particular states of mind. The album was recorded using state of the art technology called Immersive Audio.

The 16th century experienced a substantial development in the cappella ducale of Saint Mark’s, which, until the end of the 17th century, remained the leading center of musical activity in the city. Evidence of this comes from the profusion of significant musicians that it received in that “Golden Age”: either as maestri di cappella, or as organists (Claudio Merulo, Andrea and Giovanni Gabrieli), or as virtuoso instrumentalists (the cornet player Giovanni Bassano). Claudio Merulo and Andrea Gabrieli played a decisive role in the simultaneous emergence of Venetian keyboard and stile concertato music. The latter’s nephew Giovanni Gabrieli can be thought of as the standard-bearer of the Venetian School as a whole. The cornett virtuoso Giovanni Bassano composed magnificent polychoral motets in stile concertato for the idiosyncratic liturgy found at St Mark’s. With such works Bassano emerges as the worthy successor of the Gabrielis.

In concert, the choirs are spread out around the nave, with the audience in the middle. Benevolo was born to a Burgundian confectioner father who had emigrated to Rome. Educated at the choir school of San Luigi dei Francesi, he became one of the greatest geniuses of polychorality, a prolific composer who represented the splendors of French art in Rome. He ended his career as maestro di cappella at the Vatican. This music has been resurrected thanks to the work of the great musicologist Jean Lionnet, who spent many years copying out by hand the music of numerous Italian composers in the Vatican archives, from which it was impossible to borrow documents.

It’s a kind of melancholic exuberance; at once happy and sad, klezmer sounds simultaneously like laughing and weeping. Klezmer is a musical genre in a constant state of evolution. Perhaps its history lends itself to this- the original klezmorim were itinerant musicians who would travel around the shtetls of Eastern Europe performing at weddings and other occasions, until displacement of the Jewish population in the late 19th and early 20th centuries saw klezmer make its way to America where it met with jazz and other western music. These qualities make it difficult to pinpoint exactly what klezmer is today. To quote Gustavo Bulgach, whose band Klezmer Juice is featured on this collection, “klezmer is like a soapy pig.

History shows, however, a diverse background of cultural roots and influences including Indian, Jewish, Byzantine, Arabic, and South American. At certain times throughout the history of the Iberian Peninsula, people from these various cultures have passed through and settled in Andalusia and in so doing forged their own particular characteristics upon the development of this southern region of Spain. At the fall of their last stronghold in Granada in 1492 after the occupation of southern Spain for seven hundred years, the Moors left behind a cultural heritage so strong and of such magnitude that five centuries later, the impact of their influence is still very much apparent. In this diverse cultural melting pot of so many different races, the seeds of flamenco were sown and there emerged a new form of musical expression. Flamenco has been evolving continuously and today the three principal elements of singing, dancing and guitar playing have reached a peak of unsurpassed technical virtuosity and musical sophistication.

Debussy combined Russian as well as Oriental and East Asian influences with his admiration for Bach and the French harpsichord masters to create a relatively compact body of work. The classical contours and absolute clarity of Debussy’s musical forms and the unity and self-contained character of his work, for which he owed a great debt to Rameau, contradict the widely held association of his music with vague, indistinct impressionism, which Debussy vehemently rejected. Debussy’s music is characterized by its refinement of tone colors, transforming sound into a unique and highly nuanced world of expression. Debussy’s emphasis on tone color is directly linked to his harmonic style: while being neither attached to tonality nor leaving it entirely behind, Debussy transcended the formative effect of functional harmonic relationships through the use of chromaticism, and pentatonic and exotic scales. Mario Haring was born into a German-Japanese family of musicians in Hanover Germany in 1989 and grew up in Berlin.

The first thematic song was the piece Muhammad.” After a concert in Aleppo, Syria in 2010, Timo took an early morning walk through the streets as people were opening up shop and promptly got lost. He turned to a friendly looking man, Muhammad, who immediately stopped work. “He gave up an hour of his time,” remembers Timo, “not only to guide me back on track but to show me around the city. I wrote the piece for him and tried to incorporate his pride and dignity into the melody. We never exchanged contact information. Ever since the terrible bombings, I’ve been wondering what became of him.”",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=BTH%204731801&medium=phy,02 Jazz,Jazz,,Netherlands,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He chooses his co-musicians exclusively according to the pleasure principle, and does not know any prejudices not only in this respect, but has played with Fredy Studer, Urs Leimgruber, Carla Bley, Ray Anderson, Erika Stucky, and many more. He regularly jumps back and forth between Jimi Hendrix, Samuel Becket, and Chinese folk music in the search for inspiration and seems to expand his artistic portfolio every second. Christy Doran, for this release, got the idea to bundle 20 electric guitars, four electric basses and a drumset into an orchestra that has never before existed in this form. He calls it “144 Strings for a Broken Chord” in view of the tempestuous storm that it creates.One has to listen to this sometimes brutal elemental force, which can change into a soft hovering in a matter of seconds, a vacuum of reverberating sound fragments.

Padovano probably joined Willaert’s group of pupils, and he would have encountered the likes of Andrea Gabrieli and Cipriano de Rore. Nonetheless, his reputation rests on the slender book of organ music published in 1604, which reveals him as a master contrapuntalist of his age in the Ricercars, and no less innovative or inventive in his use of the Toccata form, clearly Venetian in spirit yet individual in expression. Vincenzo Pellegrini was born in Pesaro around 1562. Following his studies at the seminary, he became a canon regular of the cathedral in 1589 and appears to have been a popular teacher as well as a composer of church music. His work for organ likely dates from the end of his life, when he had become a canon in Milan Cathedral where there was a stronger tradition of instrumental composition. The Canzoni that have come down to us betray an evident debt to the French chanson tradition: simpler in form than Pellegrini, their melodic freshness and charm offers more than ample compensation in works such as ‘La Serpentina’ which has become a popular work of the period in its own right. This is Luca Scandali’s sixth album for Brilliant Classics, after imaginative collections of repertoire such as ‘Balli, battaglie e canzoni’ and 17th-century Italian organ music by Galuppi and Pasquini. For this album he has selected the historically significant organ in the Basilica of Santa Barbara in Mantova, which is tuned to the mean-tone temperament used in the era of Padovano and Pellegrini",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=BRI95259&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Renaissance,Germany,2018 Brilliant Classics,2018 Brilliant Classics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is the context for ready wit and vivid characters dancing before us in the harpsichord manuscript left to us as the principal work of an instrumental virtuoso who was blind from birth. Little else is known of Valente, though he became an organist in one of the city’s private chapel between 1565 and 1580, and we know that this Intavolatura was published in 1576, by which time the composer’s reputation had spread far beyond the kingdom of Naples. It seems certain that the collection was the first of its kind to be written in southern Italy. These are popular dances rather than original melodies, and Valente transcribes and elaborates them in various genres of song and dance: there are hymns (a Salve Regina), galliards, ricercars, ballads, even a flamboyant ‘Bascia Flammignia’, placed in exuberant juxtaposition, hardly designed to be heard in strict order but a collection to delight and entertain. The Intavolatura does so here, thanks to the imaginative re-instrumentation and sparkling performances of an Italian early-music ensemble, L’Amorosa Caccia. The songs are reattributed to a pair of singers (Giulia Valentini and Marcos Garcia Gutierrez), accompanied by two violas da gamba and a recorder, with the overall artistic direction undertaken from the keyboard by Fabio Antonio Falcone.

Yet there are few audio-only recordings of his music presently available. Thus the new album from the prince of the Minimalist piano, Jeroen van Veen, fills a significant gap in the market. The first half contains the set of Ten Easy Pieces for piano which are already popular as scores with countless student and amateur pianists. However only one recording has been made, not widely available, and this new Brilliant Classics recording will introduce many listeners to the uniquely haunting and inspiring sound world of Preisner. Although his trademark melodies are tinged with melancholy, several of the Easy Pieces are outgoing and exuberant such as To See More and The Art of Flying. The second half concentrates on piano arrangements of the film music which won Preisner his reputation. There are themes and extensive excerpts here from Kieslowski’s Décalogue and the Trois Couleurs trilogy, starring Juliette Binoche, Julie Delpy and Jean-Louis Trintignant, through which millions of cinema-goers fell in love with Preisner’s music. Also included are the main themes from three more recent films, The Double Life of Véronique, Fairytale and The Secret Garden, all of them haunting and bittersweet. This album is the latest in the hugely successful series of minimalist piano music albums made by Jeroen van Veen for Brilliant Classics. Previous best-sellers include music by Arvo Pärt, Philip Glass, Michael Nyman, Lodovico Einaudi and Yann Tiersen, composer of the music for Amélie.

Now the most celebrated member of a distinguished family of flute makers and players, he paid his way into the French royal court through his father’s well-rewarded success, and became ‘grand hautbois du roy’. In turn he passed the post on to his son, who married the daughter of the organist Balbastre. Even taking into account the prolific output of his contemporary Boismortier, there is surely no more dazzling and uplifting Baroque music composed for the flute and recorder than the suites of Hotteterre which are presented here complete in new recordings, led by the Madrid-based musician Guillermo Peñalver: the sessions took place in the magnificent chapel of San Lorenzo in the city’s Escorial Palace. Several quicker movements present the soloist with considerable technical challenges. The Allemande of the Third Suite appears to imitate waterfalls from the fountain in the gardens of Saint-Cloud through descending arpeggios. Yet the virtuosity is always lightly worn in Hotteterre, never written for the sake of sheer display but always to charm and delight the listener. Within the same suite is one of his most beautiful pieces, Le Plaintif; a simple rondeau with subtle, imperceptibly entangling ornamentation. In addition to the suites, Peñalver presents several brief flute solos, and then the two extraordinary Préludes in which Hotteterre sums up and condenses all of his skill, artistry and science. While nominally cast in D major and G minor, each of them moves through every key belonging to their respective scales in a remarkable feat of compositional ingenuity, introducing abundant changes of mood and character along the way: so much for the commonplace idea of the French Baroque as a polished idiom as orderly as the courtly etiquette which accompanied it.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=BRI95511&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Germany,2018 Brilliant Classics,2018 Brilliant Classics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Scarlatti: La Giuditta,Mario Nuvoli; Marco Lazzara; Rosita Frisani; Alessandro Stradella Consort,1,CD,9.35,14.99,"As Gramophone noted of a recent Brilliant Classics issue, ‘Estévan Velardi and the Alessandro Scarlatti Consort have notched up an impressively broad discography of unjustly neglected Italian Baroque masters.’ This release presents a reissue of a recording made in 1995, the premiere for Giuditta. This is a two-act oratorio composed by Alessandro Scarlatti, who has been the particular focus of Velardi’s work on record, encompassing other treasurable discoveries issued on Brilliant Classics such as the Oratorio per La Santissima Trinità, Il dolore di Maria Vergine and San Filippo Neri, which was welcomed by Gramophone for ‘Velardi’s admirable zeal, worthy endeavor, natural pacing and the shapely string playing of his band.’ Giuditta is based on the Biblical story of Judith, a beautiful Israelite widow who insinuates herself within the camp of the conquering Assyrian tribe and deceives their general, Holofernes, before decapitating him and carrying off his head in triumph. This is the second version of the oratorio, known as the Cambridge version after the location of the manuscript when it was turned up in modern times. Scarlatti had considered the original version, composed for Rome in 1693, to be his finest oratorio. This is no mean assessment from the composer of masterworks, which have been more celebrated in our own time such as La Maddalena, for their expressive pathos and superbly grateful vocal lines. At any rate, Scarlatti conducted a revision of Giuditta four years later, scaling down the forces of the original to three solo voices, strings and continuo: it is this version, incisive and dramatic, which is performed by the Alessandro Stradella Consort.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=BRI95536&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Germany,2018 Brilliant Classics,2018 Brilliant Classics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To the music long known to be his, from musicologist Martin Falck’s catalogue of 1913 and the Bach-Repertorium edited by Peter Wollny, have been added formerly unknown or misattributed works that affirm his remarkable genius, from the collection of Sarah Itzig Levy and the recently found Vilnius manuscript of keyboard music. His Sinfonias are transitional in form from Baroque to Classical, much like his compositional style as a whole, which looks back to the rigorous counterpoint of his father while embracing the emotional expression of the ‘empfindsamer’ style. Sinfonias were evolving from instrumental overtures attached to larger vocal forms into stand-alone works, forerunners of the modern symphony, containing their own discrete movements. The Suite in G minor, formerly attributed to his father, is one such piece. His Harpsichord Concertos combine binary sonata form with the traditional ritornello. The chamber music in this set features the flute and includes the erstwhile-misattributed Sonata in F. The sizeable collection of Keyboard Works performed here by eminent harpsichordist Claudio Astronio represents the largest part of Wilhelm Friedemann’s surviving oeuvre and also includes many new discoveries, while the Organ Music, from a composer considered to be the greatest organist of his day, leaves one wishing for more, either because the manuscripts simply did not survive or because Wilhelm Friedemann was such a skilled improviser that he wrote down sadly little of the organ wizardry with which he awed his contemporaries. The Cantatas are multi-movement works he composed for major feast days while director at Halle’s Liebfrauenkirche.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=BRI95596&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Baroque Era,Germany,2018 Brilliant Classics,2018 Brilliant Classics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Born a generation before Bach and Handel, he exercised a decisive influence upon their style and that of other composers such as Couperin, Vivaldi and Telemann: the style and practice of Baroque violin playing is unimaginable without the example of Corelli as a guiding spirit in terms of playing, teaching and writing music. As Geminiani remarked, ‘His merit was not depth of learning like that of Alessandro Scarlatti, nor great fancy or rich invention in melody or harmony, but a nice ear and most delicate taste which led him to select the most pleasing harmonies and melodies and to construct the parts so as to produce the most delightful effect upon the ear.’ All these qualities may be appreciated in abundance in the Op.5 collection of 11 violin sonatas, which concludes with perhaps the composer’s best-known work, his standalone set of variations upon the Spanish dance La Folia. This is worked up by Corelli from a slow and poignant sarabande into a wild and exuberant showpiece for the instrument showing the full range of any soloist’s capabilities. It is played here with tremendous brio by Rémy Baudet, the violinist who also leads the Orchestra of the 18th Century founded by Frans Brüggen.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=BRI95597&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Germany,2018 Brilliant Classics,2018 Brilliant Classics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The 12 Grandes Etudes and 12 Petites Etudes recorded here are designed for professional or at least highly accomplished musicians, full of technical challenges yet satisfyingly musical in their own right. The idiom is tonal but modern, often reflective in mood, using repeated motifs which owe something both to the guitar tradition and to Minimalist music. As Adriano Sebastiani remarks in his booklet notes to this new recording, ‘Casarini’s compositions are highly distinctive, never banal, certainly idiomatic and always to the point. By the same token they can also be intrepid, and inclined to create evocative atmospheres and states of mind that can convey deep feelings.’ This is Adriano Sebastiani’s fifth album for Brilliant Classics, after well-received recordings where he accompanies singers in music by Dowland, Spohr, Weber and Rossini. Thus he brings to Casarini’s music a natural feeling for its Romantic character and easy melodic flow. The album also joins an expanding and valuable collection of studies for guitar on Brilliant Classics, including two collections of Easy Studies and volumes dedicated to Sor, to Gangi and Gilardino, among others. This is the projected first volume of a series designed by Sebastiani to bring Casarini’s compositional voice to an international audience and to give a more complete picture of the stylistic variety, the value and beauty of his music",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=BRI95633&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Germany,2018 Brilliant Classics,2018 Brilliant Classics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Yet this album presents the premiere modern recording of two highly appealing Romantic violin sonatas which fill out our understanding of Rheinberger’s diverse output and deserve to stand alongside many more frequently played works in the genre. Even if Rheinberger is chiefly remembered for his organ and choral music, he wrote assiduously for the concert hall and especially chamber venues, in a vein that will remind listeners of Mendelssohn, Franck and especially Brahms. The First Sonata in E flat is distinguished by the idyllic character of its central slow movement, and by the thrilling whirl of its Tarantella finale. It is in the later E minor Sonata that we find the kind of expansive approach to melody and form which was to prove so influential on a generation of composers through Rheinberger’s work as a teacher at the Munich Conservatoire, where his pupils included Engelbert Humperdinck, Ermanno Wolf-Ferrari and Wilhelm Furtwängler. The album is completed by three song transcriptions, with the song-line given to the violin. These are Vorüber and Ich wandelte unter den Bäumen from Rheinberger’s Op.4 collection, and Im Sturm Op.41.

A century after his death, he is being celebrated across the world in 2018, and this album promises to make a special contribution on record with arrangements of works, most of them relatively unfamiliar, which particularly lend themselves to the ethereal and exquisite combination of voice and harps. Much of the music here was written while Debussy was composing his only opera Pelléas et Mélisande, a Symbolist drama based on the play by Maurice Maeterlinck, who recognized that in many ways Debussy had not only set his play to music but even outstripped and further enriched his original. There is the early and peaceful Ballade from 1890, then the Proses lyriques from 1892-3 and the seductive Trois Chansons de Bilitis (1897), from which this musical partnership takes its name. Bilitis is the fictional poet of Classical antiquity invented by Pierre Louÿs, writing in an erotic, symbolist vein after the fashion of Sappho: and when in 1900 Debussy came to use the texts of Louÿs again for the Musique de Scène pour les chansons de Bilitis, the music accompanied a tableau vivant in pre-Raphaelite style of winsome and scantily clothed young women. The recital is completed by the Danse sacrée et danse profane – originally composed for harp and orchestra in 1904, here with the orchestral parts arranged for a second harp – and the six Epigraphes Antiques from 1914, which return to the musical material of the Bilitis works but in the composer’s more allusive late style which would lead to his final masterpiece written for Serge Diaghilev, Jeux.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=BRI95657&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Germany,2018 Brilliant Classics,2018 Brilliant Classics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The album, which is the world premiere of the recording, is a rarity. The reconstruction of the score was made by Maciej Prochaska, whose commentary was included in the liner notes. Stanislaw Moniuszko is known as “the father of Polish opera” and the author of Songbook for Home Use. However, he was also a creator of cantatas, in which unlike any other Polish composer, he knew how to combine the typically operatic element of drama with characteristic lyricism and the meditative aura of songs.

There is a saying among artists who write for children that their profession requires greater effort and talent than writing for adults ‘because a child is a demanding recipient and cannot abide falsehood.’ Because of this truth, Lutoslawski’s miniatures should be performed with impeccable diction, constant intonation, and an ideal sense of rhythm.

This recording features compositions for saxophone and various instruments that led the composer to the create Through the Ethereal Gate for solo saxophonist-thereminist. This piece is unique because it features a new playing system where the saxophonist can generate notes and effects from a theremin while playing the saxophone. The “Ethereal Gate” is the invisible barrier in thin air that separates the area where the theremin is inactive from the one where the theremin recognizes someone’s presence. The composer, on the saxophone, is joined by clarinettist Kimball Sykes, violinist Marc Djokic, and pianist Frédéric Lacroix. Victor Herbiet studied saxophone with Peter Smith and Noël Samyn and composition with Steven Gellman at the University of Ottawa where he obtained a Bachelor’s and Master’s degree in saxophone performance. After serving with the Canadian Forces music branch between 1999 and 2011, Victor reoriented his career towards solo performance, education and composition.

With his Fifth Brandenburg Concerto, Bach had created the first ever harpsichord concerto. In Leipzig, the opportunity arose to continue this experiment: each week at Café Zimmermann he conducted his Collegium musicum in orchestral concerts that lasted around two hours. In the summer of 1733, he took delivery of “a new harpsichord, the like of which has not been heard before around here.” This magnificent instrument, which featured in the Zimmermann concerts, urgently called for concertos to be played by Bach himself as soloist, and even more so his sons and students. Not only in Saxony but also well beyond, Bach was considered to be the absolute authority on all things harpsichord and organ; he thus had to make his own contribution to the emerging genre of the ‘clavier concerto.’ The manuscript of his six harpsichord concertos should therefore be understood as a repertoire collection for his Collegium musicum, and as a personal manifesto.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=CC%2072773&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Austria,2018 Challenge Classics,2018 Challenge Classics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This date marks the beginning of the Thirty Years’ War, which was one of the longest and most destructive conflicts in human history: it resulted in eight million fatalities mainly from violence, famine and plagues, but also from military engagements predominantly fought on German soil since 1620, only brought to an end by the Peace of Westphalia in 1648. Arno Paduch, the leader of the Johann Rosenmüller Ensemble and a specialist of German Music from the early Baroque, has compiled a program with music written for various events which took place during this war period. It is music for political occasions, like a “Te Deum” dedicated to Emperor Ferdinand II for the celebration after the Battle at the White Mountain by Johann Sixt von Lerchenfels, Heinrich Schütz’ composition “Da pacem Domine”, which was performed during the Electoral Diet in October 1627, or Andreas Düben’s funerary motet “Bonum certamen certavi” for the Swedish king Gustav Adolf, who was killed in the Battle of Lützen. But the programme also contains compositions that describe the horrors of war: two good examples are Johann Hildebrand’s simple but poignant monody “Ach Gott! Wir haben’s nicht gewusst, was Krieg für eine Plage“ (Oh Lord, we didn’t know what a real plague is war), which expressed the widespread despair at the hopelessness of the situation, or Matthias Weckmann’s sacred concerto “Wie liegt die Stadt so wüste” (How doth the city sit solitary).",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=CHR77424&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Germany,2018 Note 1 Music,2018 Note 1 Music,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He studied in Leipzig, and quite soon the town council realized that he was a musician of an immense talent. Rosenmüller therefore received a position at the famous Leipzig Thomasschule, and was considered as the future successor of the ill Thomaskantor, Tobias Michael. His future would actually have been secured at that point if a scandal had not shaken the Leipzig music scene in the spring of 1655: Johann Rosenmüller was imprisoned due to alleged homosexual activities. But he could escape from prison and flee to Italy; he lived in Venice for 25 years before he could return to Germany. But also during the time of his exile he went on composing for German courts; Rosenmüller’s music was so highly esteemed that hardly any court orchestra in the German-speaking countries could afford to neglect his works in their repertoire selection. The Rosenmüller sacred concertos recorded on this album are combined with equally fine compositions of less-known German contemporaries such as Johann Balthasar Erben, Augustin Pfleger, Christian Flor and others. The soprano Miriam Feuersinger is a specialist for sacred music of the German Baroque and was awarded with the famous German “Echo Klassik” in 2014 for her album with cantatas by Graupner.

Szymanowski’s ‘Swan’ is a fateful harbinger of suffering; and nature is similarly a source of angst and fear in the Op 11 songs, where the maudlin first two numbers (‘Joyless am I’ and ‘In the enchanted forests’) are saved by the urgent final two, ‘Flying over me into the sapphire sea’ and ‘Roar, storm!’.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=DUX1369&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Poland,,2016 DUX Recording Producers,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The sonatas reflect the transformations of the composer's constantly developing style. The Second Sonata in G minor, Op. 5 No. 2 and the 3rd Sonata in A major, Op. 69 are contrasting. The first is a youthful work, full of virtuosic fantasy and vigor, the second is the work of a mature composer, the author of significant symphonic works. The first of these was written in 1796 for the Prussian King Frederick William II, and its individual parts maintained once in the mood of court dignity, and once militarily correspond to the personality of the recipient of dedication.

The East was a greater influence to Europe in the Middle Ages than it is often realized. The Moors ruled the Iberian Peninsula for almost 800 years, and the East and the South influenced our culture, including music, through Spain and the crusades. The lute, bow and several oriental percussion instruments made their way to Europe and that is why the music of the southern cultures sounds so natural on ancient instruments. As a holy city for three world religions, not only a 'Clash of Cultures' took place in Jerusalem at all times, but also a musical transfer.

Auvity is the lovelorn Orpheus who ventures, with his lyre, into the Underworld to plead with Pluto (Etienne Bazola) for the return of his Eurydice (Céline Scheen), struck down in her prime by a snakebite, being encouraged in his efforts by Proserpine, the wife of the ruler of Hades (Floriane Hasler). This is a two-act chamber opera, written in 1686, and it is not known whether Charpentier ever composed any more music for the piece (the drama stops at a tantalizing moment in the well-known story). Even still, the composer appears to have invested substantial inspiration into the work, which will have been performed in front of the composer’s patron, Mademoiselle de Guise by a group of singers working within the limitations imposed by Jean- Baptiste Lully’s “musical monopoly” of the time. For this recording, keyboard-player Ronan Khalil directs his Ensemble Desmarest. The demanding lead role of this entertainment continues Auvity’s strong current presence in French Baroque music-making – as well as his connection with Glossa.

It is worth noting that a quarter of Dvorák’s oeuvre consists of chamber music, an astonishing amount for a composer who was active in the second half of the 19th century. Dvorák’s four piano trios are, alongside his far more numerous string quartets, among the most significant chamber works he wrote. After the first two trios of 1875/76, which give an early indication of the composer’s creative intensity, the trios presented here, namely op. 65 (1883) and op. 90 (1890/91), show him to be a fully accomplished master of this genre. The underlying sentiment of the four-movement Trio op. 65 in F minor might be described as somber, passionate and dramatic. This character is already evident in the opening idea, played by the strings in unison, a theme that then undergoes complex development and builds up to a first dramatic climax.

Sethares. The project emerged from Sundin’s exploration of Sethares’s writings from the early 90s which formalised the relationship between the notes of a tuning system, the partials of a timbre, and their relationship to sensory consonance. Sethares’s work facilitates the construction of bespoke microtonal scales from an analysis of instrumental sounds whilst retaining a coherent sense of consonance. As author Luca Turin wrote of Sethares’s work, “Physics had built a prison round music, and Sethares set it free.” The works on display here, realised over a four-year period, present a dynamic and dramatic exploration of Sethares’s thinking. From the formal rigour of ‘Emergence’, to the intricate harmonic development of ‘Splintered Echoes’, these pieces demonstrate a detailed and colourful sense of sound design allied with a meticulous structural balance – immersive, patient, timbrally rich, and often quite elegant, with intricate interplay between the acoustic and electronic sound sources. In addition to the electronic contributions of Sundin and Adkins, this recording brings together two of Sweden’s greatest proponents of new music. Percussionist Jonny Axelsson has performed new and contemporary music from a plethora of composers worldwide, ranging from works for ice percussion in the Arctic to an on-going twenty-year collaboration with composer Kevin Volans.

Learning this fact, while settling into her new position among the crisp blue skies and ornate, sometimes skeletal tree branches that adorn Wellesley’s landscape, planted the slow-growing seed for this eventual collection of songs: songs about the short life of Sylvia Plath, and songs about Jenny’s adjacent life experiences in some of the same places in which Plath once lived and worked: New York, Boston, and Wellesley. It was Sylvia Plath’s now famous summer in New York City- the summer that inspired her novel “The Bell Jar”- that would initially lure Jenny into Plath’s archive. Jenny’s own impactful years in New York City, where she attended college and graduate school, coincided with some of her most profound self-discoveries, several of which felt strangely in concert with the ways in which Plath described Esther Greenwood’s “queer, sultry” New York summer in 1953, and her exhausted return to Boston in the moody steam of August. Jenny’s move to Boston from New York in 2009 provided further inspiration and in 2012 Jenny became inspired to set these feelings of emotional closeness to Plath to music. Sylvia Songs is both an offering and an archive, a memorial and a reverie.

They recorded the music on a rainy summer day, and even though they didn’t talk about what “Summer Rain” should sound like, they shared the exact same feelings. Their lives have not always been easy, and that is expressed in “Undercurrent” and the uncertainty of their lives in “Up and Down.” But even in their darkest hours, they still remained optimistic and hopeful, as if there were a “Hidden Dance” soon to appear. Sometimes, living so far away, they get “Homesick” and have a “Heavy Heart” as they miss their homelands and families, but they keep working hard and chasing their dreams as in “Chasing Butterflies.”And they are thankful for the music they have made together in their “Chance Encounter.” They share their happy “Childhood” stories in their music.

And Tyshawn Sorey agrees: ‘None of us either hung around for the others or hurried ahead of them.’“",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=INT305&medium=phy,02 Jazz,Jazz,Jazz|Contemporary Jazz,Switzerland,2018 Intakt Records,2018 Intakt Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Applied to today's world, it is about the destruction of the environment, climate change caused by humans and the importance of a balanced climate. The music is both traditional and modern, displaying a variety of timbres, rhythms, cheerful-scurrilous and dramatic moments. With an overwhelming late-Romantic opulence the end, the 95-year-old composer's attitude towards one of mankind's most pressing themes is expressed. The world premiere of Die Regenentrude on January 27, 2018, recorded on this release, is part of the Climate Bells project. The leitmotif of Wüsthoff's composition is to be played on carillons around the world to remind people of their responsibility for the environment and climate and not to lose sight of the ""two-degree goal."" With the narrative skills of the renowned actress Martina Gedeck and Ulrich Kern at the conductor's podium of the Brandenburg State Orchestra Frankfurt, a captivating and at the same time memorable interpretation has been achieved.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=KL1525&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Orchestral,Germany,2018 Rondeau Production,2018 Rondeau Production,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Brahms’s Lieder are some of his most intimate and personal compositions, and although small in scale, there is a wealth of emotional depth and poetic sensibility to be explored in them. The exact same thing can be said of the late piano works, which are likewise small in dimension and certainly not composed as virtuosic showpieces. They are also among the most beautiful and profound of all his works, possessing a truly vocal quality with which, as a song pianist, I can immediately identify (some could almost be called ‘songs without words’). In the making of this recording, I was very fortunate that LAWO chose a wonderful reconditioned Steinway D dating from 1893, which is just a year after the composition of these late piano pieces.” Eugene Asti is one of the foremost accompanists of his generation, and regularly tours and records as a solo musician.

The time when Norwegian choral singing was dominated by male choirs can seem like the distant past. Toward the end of the nineteenth century, only eleven years after women were admitted for the first time ever as students to the university, three medical students joined forces and founded a university choir for women. The year was 1895. The Women’s Choral Society of the University of Oslo was a reality. It was in fact the world’s first academic choir for women, and has recently been ranked as the world’s best female choir by the music organization Interkultur. The collection of arrangements and compositions on this album bears the imprint of both National Romanticism and traditional Norwegian folk music. At the same time, it perhaps contains a greater variation of sources and styles than is typical for National Romantic male choir music. In the course of its long existence, KSS has in many ways created its own version of the tradition-bound, nation-affirming music. And it is this distinctive interpretation of the National Romantic element that represents much of what is unique about KSS. This release, “Som den gylne sol frembryter,” seeks to embrace something of the identity that distinguished KSS 123 years ago, and still does so today.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=LWC1144&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,,2018 Lawo Classics,2018 Lawo Classics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In his debut solo recording for Linn, Egarr charts the extraordinary breadth of invention at play in works by William Byrd. One of English music’s most influential figures, Byrd’s innovative style is evident throughout this well-chosen program of preludes, grounds and fantasies. The Fantasia in A minor, MB13, demonstrates the unlimited scope of Byrd’s imagination; intricate rhythms, surprising modulations and changing textures precede a finale requiring a previously unequalled level of dexterous virtuosity. Egarr similarly relishes the technical demands of Byrd’s descriptive masterpiece, ‘The bells.’ This incredible composition begins with a single toll before developing into an elaborate and thrillingly complex showpiece of pealing bells. Egarr’s elegant phrasing, infectious enthusiasm and rich embellishments result in insightful performances. “The music exploded with character under Egarr’s hands… His playing was fluid and assured.” (New York Classical Review)",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=CKD518&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Baroque Era,Lithuania,2018 Linn Records,2018 OUTHERE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among the selection is ‘In the silence of the mysterious night,’ one of Rachmaninov’s best-loved songs and one of the composer’s greatest achievements in this genre. Rachmaninov’s trademark melodicism is met with a perfect partner in Imbrailo’s lyric baritone, whilst his expressive and highly intricate accompaniments find a worthy partner in Hogarth. Providing a welcome contrast to the intensity of Rachmaninov is the Nordic sentimentality that Sibelius brings to his highly romantic songs. The pearl of the Opus 37 collection is ‘Var det en dröm?’, which the composer himself described as ‘my most beautiful song’. Together the duo perfectly communicates the passions and anxieties of a poet’s lost love; the rich tone of Imbrailo’s final note provides an immensely satisfying close.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=CKD482&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Modern Era,Lithuania,2018 Linn Records,2018 Outhere,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Now, her artistic capacity has blossomed tremendously, resulting in her fourth Mack Avenue Records release – the aptly titled Diamond Cut, her first album as leader since 2012’s Angelic Warrior. In those six years, she’s transitioned from being a member of Beyoncé’s touring band to becoming a full-time professor at Berklee College of Music, while still juggling a demanding career as a solo artist and touring with the likes of drummer Terri Lyne Carrington, bassist Esperanza Spalding and drummer Ralph Peterson Jr., among others. “Not that I’ve arrived by any means, but I think I’m in a space of empowerment, knowing that I’m walking in my purpose,” says Fuller as she reflects on her multifaceted career. Produced by GRAMMY®-Award winner Terri Lyne Carrington, the album finds Fuller leading two superb rhythm sections, both of which contain some of jazz’s brightest luminaries – bassist Dave Holland and drummer Jack DeJohnette, then bassist James Genus and drummer Bill Stewart.

Honstein limits his materials with discipline, finding “hidden pathos in clean, well-lighted places,” another elegant turn of phrase from Andres’ essay. The most subtle of changes become the source of that pathos- an extra repetition in a running passage, a sideways turn harmonically for a brief moment, or the addition of vibrating material to the face of the vibraphone to create subtle, wave-like sounds as we hear midway in both the first and second movements. Grand Tour also explores the solo journey of a multi-movement piece, and does so with a similarly pare approach, despite its occasional virtuosic outbursts. The work is a travel log of sorts, an internal dialogue with the city of Venice, a city that certainly comes with its share of historical, and music-historical associations.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=FCR202&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Contemporary Era,United States,Robert Honstein,Robert Honstein,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I was completely smitten by both his music and his playing, and thought that, one day, I might have the courage to approach him to write a piece for our newly formed quintet. Fast-forward to 2012, where I was fortunate enough to be playing on Gwilym Simcock’s amazing album Instrumation, and this long-held idea was suddenly given life. Having persuaded Gwilym to agree to write us something, I was then chatting with the drummer Martin France at a tea break, and I mentioned my long-held dream to ask Kenny to write a brass quintet piece. Martin immediately gave me Kenny’s phone number, and said “call him now, and tell him I said so!” … Less than three weeks later, he called back with the news that he’d already finished it! Having Kenny and Gwilym on board made it much easier to approach the other legends on this album, all of whom have also been astoundingly generous and enthusiastic about the project. This commissioning side of this project has been entirely self-funded by Onyx Brass, and we would like to put on record our heartfelt gratitude to the composers for their generosity, both of time and talent… The commissioning brief for each composer was simple: something around 5 minutes and do whatever you want!

But upon closer inspection, what is at first glance a harmless farce in a middle-class setting emerges as a profound social analysis. Wagner uses his protagonists to show how a community deals with tradition and those who break with it and just how much innovation and deviation from the norm it can tolerate - as well as to examine what value society places, and should place, on art.

Blanche McIntyre’s production appears at first to be simply modish in setting the play amid contemporary-flavored upheavals, but this pays off increasingly as she gets both humorous and serious mileage out of the conventions and nuances of public political rhetoric, with figures behind a lectern delivering pieces to camera.""

Birgit Nilsson, the young Swedish singer, had, together with Sigurd Bjorling, been recommended by Leo Blech to Winifred Wagner back in 1948 “because her sons felt eager and obliged to establish a new ensemble,” or so Wolfgang Wagner commented in 1994. Nilsson declined an offer to portray Sieglinde in Die Walkure in Bayreuth in 1951 due to an engagement at Glyndebourne. After much negotiation, she was first engaged at the festival in 1953 when she assumed the soprano part in Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony. It was this production from 1958, however, that cemented her place in Bayreuth history. Wolfgang Wagner observed in his memoirs: “The way that Birgit Nilsson and Wolfgang Windgassen, in collaboration with Karl Bohm and Wieland Wagner, became the perfect duo in the title of Tristan… had been part of my design several years previously, and so I was delighted to have conferred the ‘minor orders’ on these two great artists.”",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=ORF-C951183D&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Austria,2018 ORFEO International Music GmbH,2018 ORFEO International Music GmbH,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Woodcock, who scored his music for sixth-flute (a soprano recorder in D), oboe, and traverso with string accompaniment, wrote some of the music played by those virtuosi.

What he identified as their ‘slightly veiled sonority’ suited his style. One observer remembered the composer saying that if he was not feeling on top form, he preferred to play on an Erard, for its bright and ready-made tone. ‘But if I feel alert, ready to make my fingers work without fatigue, then I prefer a Pleyel… My fingers feel in more immediate contact with the hammers, which then translate precisely and faithfully the feeling I want to produce, the effect I want to obtain.’ The Chopin-era Pleyel was notable for its graded timbre, topped by the silvery, ethereal quality of its treble register. Chopin’s appreciation for the Pleyel sonority of pianos is written into the very fabric of his music. When he travelled to Majorca with George Sand in the winter of 1838, a Pleyel piano had to travel with them, and the composer continued to have a Pleyel grand delivered every summer, which remained until November. This was at some expense to the company, but then the relationship was mutually beneficial: while the composer was inspired by the Pleyel sound, the company did well from his patronage and his personal recommendations, and indeed Chopin and Camille Pleyel were firm friends for many years. For this mixed recital, Hubert Rutkowski plays a Pleyel instrument from 1847, during Camille’s stewardship of the firm. The most substantial works are the G minor Ballade and the B minor Scherzo, which makes so much of that glistening upper register. There is also the C sharp minor Fantaisie-Impromptu, the B flat minor Polonaise and a selection of mazurkas, nocturnes, etude and waltz. The pianist is a President of the Chopin Society in Hamburg, and has also played and recorded under the theme of Chopin’s pupils: he is among the most distinguished Chopin pianists of our day.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=PCL10129&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Germany,2018 Piano Classics,2018 Piano Classics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He already has an impressive concert diary of recitals and concertos throughout the UK and beyond: this is his debut recital, concentrating on a composer for whom he feels a particular affinity. Indeed his advocacy of Liszt has been recognised in the Liszt Society Competition in November 2016, when he won first prize. Tyler Hay’s Liszt recital ranges over the composer’s protean output. It opens with the Gothic splendour and intricate counterpoint of the Fantasy and Fugue on B-A-C-H but immediately continues in the much more intimate and elusive idiom of the first of the Valses oubliées, which are dispersed like hidden treasure throughout the album. Composed between 1881 and 1885, the Valses are fully representative examples of a ‘late style’ in Liszt, reflective mood-paintings that shift between pensiveness, resignation, and reverie. More extrovert works are interleaved with them. Tyler Hay plays Les jeux d’eaux à la Villa d’Este, the shimmering masterpiece of tone-color from the second book of the Années de pèlerinage. There is also the pianistic thunder and lightning of the First Mephisto Waltz, and the D flat major First Ballade, before a return to Gothic grandeur and Bach with the Variations on ‘Weinen, Klagen, Sorgen, Zagen’. Tyler Hay closes this assured debut recital, appropriately enough, with a farewell: the Abschied which is a setting of a Russian folksong supplied to Liszt by his pupil Alexander Siloti: a model of quiet simplicity and one of the composer’s most touching miniatures.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=PCL10138&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Germany,2018 Piano Classics,2018 Piano Classics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Following engagements on the opera stages of Wurzburg, Mannheim and Frankfurt, soprano Diana Damrau’s meteoric international career took off with performances in Berlin, Dresden, Vienna, and New York. A highly sought-after lied and concert singer, she makes regular appearances at the Kissinger Sommer, Schubertiade Schwarzenberg, as well as the Munich and Salzburg Festivals. Argentinean baritone Ivan Paley studied in Buenos Aires and the Opera Department of Miami University and then began his career as a concert and opera singer. Since moving to Vienna he has focused on German lied and collaborates with several renowned pianists. Since completing his piano studies, Stephan Matthias Lademann has focused on piano accompaniment and gained extensive experience accompanying master singers such as Birgit Nilsson, Sylvia Geszty, Julia Hamari, and of course the two vocalists on this release.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=PH14048&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Germany,2006 telos music,2014 Profil Medien,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The male choir is considered by many to be the mainstay of traditional chant and Orthodox monasticism. This release was recorded in Russia in July of 2016 in the Apostle and Evangelist John the Theologian Orthodox Church at the Saratov Orthodox Theological Seminary. PaTRAM’s objective was to immerse the listener in the beautiful Russian monastic style of singing through its fullness and richness of sonority. Highly-esteemed conductor Maestro Vladimir Gorbik, whose pedigree is from the Moscow Conservatory and as choirmaster of the Holy Trinity-St. Sergius Lavra Representation Choir, skillfully unites strong musicianship with superb diction to a degree that is seldom heard outside of Russia, but which epitomizes the best traditional culture of singing in the Russian Orthodox Church.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=FR-727SACD&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Choral,Germany,2018 PaTRAM Institute,2018 Reference Recordings,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Italian-Argentine composer Daniel Pacitti gives the core messages of the Reformation a musical guise. Concerned about touching the heart and mind alike, Pacitti focused mainly on listener-friendliness, in deliberate contrast to other contemporary works. The result is a perfectly balanced mixture of different musical styles – from medieval chorales and traditional songs from the Reformation to the late Romanticism of Italian opera culture: a multi-layered and gripping drama with a happy ending. The present release is a valuable document of the world premiere and thus the world's first recording ever of Wir sind Bettler.

It was one of those seismic moments of culture in which his use of traditional idioms in a completely new composition reframed the way Irish music and dance was viewed not just by people outside of the country but also at home. The show has been seen by over 24 million people in more than 450 venues worldwide. This premiere recording of three of Whelan’s major compositions, performed by the RTE National Symphony Orchestra conducted by David Brophy, again reveals his ability to create original and accessible new music, this time in an orchestral context. He wrote Linen and Lace, a flute concerto for Sir James Galway, as a work that musically unites their respective home cities of Belfasst and Limerick. Inishlacken is a concerto for two violins, named after a deserted island off the Galway coast. The third work on the album is Whelan’s symphonic setting of the music of Riverdance.

Combining exceptional lyricism and insight with consummate technique, Alessio Bax is without a doubt “among the most remarkable young pianists now before the public” (Gramophone). He catapulted to prominence with First Prize wins at both the Leeds and Hamamatsu International Piano Competitions, and is now a familiar face on four continents, not only as a recitalist and chamber musician, but as a concerto soloist. He has appeared with more than 100 orchestras, including the London and Royal Philharmonic Orchestras, Dallas and Cincinnati Symphonies, NHK Symphony in Japan, St. Petersburg Philharmonic with Yuri Temirkanov, and the City of Birmingham Symphony with Sir Simon Rattle. Alessio has appeared frequently with the Southbank Sinfonia in concerts and recordings – their 2013 disc of Mozart’s Concertos Nos. 24 & 27 was described by Musicweb International’s critic as their “Recording of the Month … and quite possibly my recording of the year”. A live concert of the “Emperor” concerto in 2016 with the orchestra in Tuscany’s Incontri in Terra di Siena festival was met with praise by reviewers: “[Bax’s] capacity for softness and for evenness of touch came beautifully to the fore for the concerto’s many top-keyboard pianissimo flutterings, as his strong relationship with the orchestra also reaped dividends, producing satisfyingly sympathetic chamber pockets amidst the surrounding symphonic excitement.” Bachtrack (Live Concert Review)",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=SIGCD525&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Orchestral,Germany,2018 Signum Records,2018 Signum Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many of the works were composed in the years immediately following the event, including ‘O clap your hands,’ ‘Lord, thou hast been our refuge’ and the Mass in G minor which leads the programme. Vaughan Williams turned his attention to liturgical music following his service as a wagon orderly during the Great War. Ursula Vaughan Williams, his second wife and biographer, wrote that such work ‘gave Ralph vivid awareness of how men died’. It is perhaps unsurprising that in many of the texts to which he turned after the 1918 Armistice, the fragility and weakness of humanity becomes a recurrent theme. Despite being described as a ‘confirmed atheist’ by the philosopher Bertrand Russell, his heightened exploration of Christian texts, symbols, and images after the War might rather be understood both as an attempt to grapple anew with what might lie, as he put it, ‘beyond sense and knowledge’, and to search for consolation in religious and other inherited traditions amid a world irrevocably changed.

The result is a fascinating conversation between past and present in which Beethoven’s mastery of the form receives illuminating – and often surprising – commentary from entirely modern perspectives. Volume 1 focuses on Beethoven’s first five Violin Sonatas – Opp. 12 (Nos. 1-3), 23, 24 – and the Third Sonata from his Op. 30. They are each coupled with first recordings of their new companion pieces. Jonathan Dove’s Ludwig Games is a glorious “upbeat” to Beethoven’s First Sonata in which motivic dynamism and minimalist accents are brilliantly matched. The punningly titled A Major Chase updates the humorous Second Sonata in a virtuosic display described by composer Peter Ash as “Bartók meets Tom and Jerry”. Imaginatively re-working the key of E flat, the characterful dissonance of Elspeth Brooke’s Swoop offers a decidedly contemporary response to the Third Sonata. Judith Bingham’s The Neglected Child pays a heartfelt homage to Beethoven’s Op. 23, while Huw Watkins’ Spring is a masterly miniature inspired by the radiant, lyrical textures of Op. 24. Jeremy Thurlow’s Mehlschöberl alights on the wit of Op. 30 No. 3 to take two motivic cells from Beethoven’s score as the starting point for an intriguing and involving set of colorful transformations. Daniel Tong says: “The new companion pieces locate this set of recordings within a specific time – these composers’ responses to Beethoven coupled with our response as interpreters – leaving us with the thought that, in the end, all interpretation is work in progress.”",https://soundcloud.com/siva-oke/op24-1-e2,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=SOMMCD%200181-2&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,,2018 SOMM Recordings,2018 SOMM Recordings,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fiercely imbued with the spirit of Beethoven, Mendelssohn’s Opp. 12, 13 and 80 quartets brim and boil with an innovation, dynamism, emotional sincerity and technical flair some would deny the composer. These deeply felt performances from the Tippett Quartet present Mendelssohn in a new light and challenge Hans von Bülow’s notorious observation that he “began as a genius and ended as a talent.” All three quartets – Op. 13, composed when Mendelssohn was just 18-years-old, and Op. 80, his last major work, completed two months before his death at 38 – speak movingly of loss. Op. 12 laments the passing of Beethoven, Op. 13 regrets unrequited love, Op. 80 an inconsolable response to the death of Mendelssohn’s sister, Fanny. The earlier works, the Tippett Quartet says, “command an astounding expressive power and technical prowess with all the exuberance and intensity of a young man searching for the sublime and the profound.” Mendelssohn’s last significant musical utterance, the valedictory Op. 80, “turns his sense of loss, grief and, most of all, anger into a truly sublime work of art”. “When we were recording them,” says the Tippett Quartet, “it felt like we were playing brand new pieces by a living composer, not works that carry, and have become burdened by, the weight of tradition”. These poignant, powerful, emotionally raw, musically rich performances make persuasive claim for music of passion, poetry and profundity and offer fresh insights into Mendelssohn as he was meant to be played.",https://soundcloud.com/siva-oke/01-mendelssohn-quartet-no-6-in-fminor-op-80-allegro-vivace-assai-44k-16b,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=SOMMCD%200182&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,,2018 SOMM Recordings,2018 SOMM Recordings,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Janos Starker’s cello playing is often described as a “mixture of fire and ice,” and is characterized by an indomitably forward-driving power, a linear tension that leaves no room for narcissistic sentimentality. The key to it is his idea of “anticipatory playing,” that is, of constantly “forehearing,” which he demanded of his pupils, as well as clearly knowing that a constant distribution of the body tension as well as musical tension is part and parcel of virtuoso discipline, that only after the last tone has died out is there any room to really ease the tension. In the major solo concertos from the Romantic era on, he always saw his role as that of the protagonist, facing the orchestra on an equal footing. He considered the concertos as symphonic works of developing interaction and stressed that it was not a matter of keeping the soloist always in the foreground.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=SWR19418CD&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Germany,1971/75 SWR Media Services GmbH,2018 Naxos Deutschland GmbH,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
