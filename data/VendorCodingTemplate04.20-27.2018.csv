As is so often the case, his flute compositions are deemed to be the culmination of their times, not only because of their contrapuntal content, but also because of the tremendous technical difficulties confronting the flute player. In some cases, Bach pushes the boundaries of the flautistic possibilities of the time to their utmost limits, making full use of the tonal range of the instrument and even leading the transverse flute into its remotest key ranges. In addition to solo works (the Partita BWV 1013 and a set of flute sonatas), on this release Jan De Winne presents concertos in which the transverse flute plays a crucial role: the Orchestral Suite No. 2 BWV 1067 (a “must” in the repertoire of any flutist), the Brandenburg Concerto No. 5 BWV 1050, and the Triple Concerto BWV 1044.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=ACC%2024341&medium=phydig,01 Classical,Classical,,Netherlands,2018 ACC 24341,2018 ACC 24341,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the two works were composed only thirty years apart from one another, they could not be any more contrasting: minor against major, dark, mystical and introverted against exciting, suspenseful and sometimes ironic. And yet, in the contrasts of these two concertos, the virtuoso and inspiring interpretation of the Chinese violinist reveals something amazingly unifying. Noticed by Yehudi Menuhin at a young age, Zhi-Jong Wang is considered one of the most promising violinists of her generation and continues to receive increasing international attention.

He gives voice to love in all its joyful and challenging moments in this, his greatest piano suite. Granados uses the titles and the scenographic notes in the score to illustrate how two lovers make overtures to each other as they dance, how their relationship blossoms even as it weathers darker days, until fate ultimately takes its toll and one of the lovers passes away, leaving the other behind with beautiful memories.

The Beijing Zhi Hua Temple was built during the Ming dynasty in 1443. Zhi Hua Temple music has remained pure and close to its original state, being passed down through 27 generations exclusively through orgal transmission. Having its roots in the music of the Tang and Song dynasties, Zhi Hua Temple music derived its special style by combining court, Buddhist temple, and folk music. Two styles of this music developed, differentiating primarily in playing styles, instrumentation and title of pieces. Jing Yue (music from the Beijing area) is the most popular and Cham Yue (chanting music) is used exclusively for Buddhist services and ceremonies. The instrumentation consists primarily of percussion and wind instruments, with the lead instruments being the oboe-like guanzi. The earliest score dates back to the Qing dynasty. In the 1980s, much attention was given to Buddhist temple music and the first Chinese Buddhist music touring ensemble was founded.

Gypsy musicians, many having learned their instruments from an early childhood, usually are virtuoso players of their instruments and are able to express and project a rainbow of emotions with their guitars, accordions, violins, and other instruments. The term ‘gypsy music’ refers strictly to the gypsies’ own folk music, but in its broadest sense has become a general term for music performed and cultivated by gypsies. The gypsies were/are an itinerant people believed to have originated from northern India. By the 9th century gypsies were in Persia, and by the 11th they had reached Bulgaria. By the 15th century they were present throughout many European countries. As many Roma worked as musicians or entertainers, they had a considerable impact on the music of the countries they lived in- their own particular musical style often combined with the folk music of a particular country, thus preserving the traditions over centuries. Today’s so-called gypsy repertoire can be described as a blend of influences from all of these areas. The Roma have influenced musical works by Bizet, Brahms, and Dvorak, to name but a few.

This new recording presents both sides of Monteverdi’s sacred style: the stile antico or strict contrapuntal style, exemplified in the Mass for four voices published posthumously in 1650; and the stile moderno, that is, concertato and solo vocal writing. The concertato style, which combines and intertwines voices and instruments in dialogue, characterizes the monumental Gloria a 7, which was conceived for a cappella rich in virtuoso singers and instrumentalists. But in this city of theaters, in the heyday of the canto a voce sola, Monteverdi transformed the famous Lamento d’Arianna (from his lost opera Arianna) into a sacred piece. The Litanies to the Virgin Mary, published in three collections between 1620 and 1650, represent the expression of a gentle Marian style, dominated by a cappella choral invocations alternating with brief solo passages.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=A447&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Austria,2018 Outhere Music France,2018 Outhere Music France,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The distance covered is immense: from Beethoven’s Horn Sonata, still entirely immersed in the style of the late 18th century, passing through Robert Schumann’s Romantic attitude and leading to Giselher Klebe’s Alteration of Beethoven’s so-called Moonlight Sonata, thereby creating a technically challenging work with perspectives that mirror a multitude of tendencies.

That is why I try to create a composition that works in itself, but provides enough space for the guys, just as if we’re having a conversation.” The overall feel of the album is impetuous yet thoughtful.

In the late 15th century, the renaissance philosopher Marsilio Ficino wrote that music was “nothing but a decoration of silence,” and music could bring out a “divine frenzy.” In our modern age, with piped music everywhere in lifts, airplanes and doctors’ offices, and music available on tap whenever and wherever we wish through digital media devices, our experience of music has been diluted, losing much of its original power. The Italian lutenist, Francesco da Milano, known as “il divino,” was said to have sent his audiences into a trance and rob them of their senses, save one, that of hearing. This album invites the 21st century listener into a world of sensual delight and a real decoration of silence. World-renowned lutenist Nigel North returned to the studio to continue his series of recordings of the works of Il Divino- better known as Francesco da Milano. “North leans more towards allowing a phrase’s flow gently to retard as it reaches the still pool of its final tone… ultimately it’s North’s intense introspection and empathy that make this a thoughtful programme…” (Gramophone)  ",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=BGS128&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Renaissance,Germany,2018 BGS Records,2018 BGS Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There is nothing known about his debut as a musician, but he must have been noticed not far on since, when he was just a bit older than twenty, he drew upon himself the attention of Casa Ricordi, which strove to represent his Vanna in the Teatro Dal Verme, a prestigious theater in Milan at that time. The opera was performed on November 23, 1910. Vanna is an exquisite score that transfigures a typical Realist libretto, with an orchestration having, at times, an almost Ravel-like touch. The overture is an introductory piece that already encloses within it the first signs of an impending drama, with the death knell, which resounds again at the end of the opera. The characters are well-constructed: the main character, since her first appearance, is presented to us as a young girl who is in love and who is indifferent to everything else.

Sometimes he undertook the transcription of his orchestral works for the popular domestic market of piano duet; on other occasions he left the work to trusted friends and colleagues. Although the composer did not apparently have any other instrument in mind when he wrote the First Violin Sonata, the piece sits peculiarly well on the cello once transposed to the key of D major by the cellist Paul Klengel; its pervasive mood of profound melancholy is even enhanced by the cello’s voice. Clara Schumann recognized the sonata as one of Brahms’s most tender yet regretful tributes to her, and wished that it should be played at her funeral, to which purpose Klengel’s transcription is eminently suited. Norbert Salter (1868-1935) was a cellist who played under Mahler in both Budapest and Hamburg; this is his only published transcription, a set of six Lieder by Brahms which may well have been made under the elderly composer’s supervision. Like the Brahms/Klengel Sonata, this is a sensitive yet now little-known piece of work which deserves modern appreciation. Francesco Dillon and Emanuele Torquati conclude their fourth album for Brilliant Classics in a lighter vein, with nine of the ever-popular Hungarian Dances, arranged to stylish effect by the Italian virtuoso Alfredo Piatti who did so much to advance the cause of the cello as a solo instrument in the 19th century.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=BRI95415&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Chamber Music,Germany,2018 Brilliant Classics,2018 Brilliant Classics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is assumed that they both were born in the 1540s, without authoritative record, but their work in the royal court of the 1560s is attested. Johnson made his career as an accomplished performer, while Holborne’s energies were focused on writing for the instrument.

His works show the English taste for cross-relations, surprising harmonic and tonal relationships and, above all, variation. However, like Holborne, he developed the form of the pavan during the course of his career, endowing it with increasing richness of ornamentation and expression, to be enjoyed in full in the melancholy undertow of the Passingmeasures Pavan. Holborne’s lute music is still more painstakingly elaborate, designed perhaps less for public show than private reflection, to give as much pleasure to the musician as to his courtly audience.

This will amount to the first comprehensive recording of Dussek's piano sonatas on period instruments. It will catalogue the brilliant, harmonically beautiful and expressive music of one of the most fascinating composers at the threshold of early Romanticism, one of Beethoven’s most gifted and original contemporaries. In fact the parallels between Dussek and Beethoven are uncanny on this album, featuring three Op.10 sonatas and then Op.31 No.2 (though the ‘Pastorale’ subtitle corresponds with Beethoven’s Op.28). The instrument used on this album is a 1798 fortepiano from the firm of Longman-Clementi. It dates from a decade after the Op.10 sonatas and only a few years after Op.31 No.2 from 1795. Accordingly the touch and sound corresponds more closely than any other piano previously used on recordings of this repertoire. Dussek lived in London during the 1790s, and worked closely with the manufacturer John Broadwood to extend the range of keyboard instruments. The English fortepiano lent itself naturally to the harmonic fullness of Dussek's preferred textures, and in reverse, the instrument's characteristic sound and touch inspired and shaped the development of Dussek's compositional style. Even more important than the instrument is the musician, naturally, and in Bart van Oort these sonatas find an interpreter with years of experience in performing music of this time and place. His complete survey of Mozart’s keyboard music was praised in Gramophone for ‘attractive intimacy’ and ‘sensitive, singing accounts’; his survey of early-Romantic nocturnes is distinguished by ‘strong, authoritative artistry’.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=BRI95599&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Germany,2018 Brilliant Classics,2018 Brilliant Classics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The composer was himself a lifelong Catholic, a man of uncomplicated faith and not prey to spiritual torments in the manner of his contemporary Bruckner. Dvorák wrote religious music throughout his career, though his first substantial contribution was the Stabat mater of 1876-7. This large-scale setting burns with a restrained pathos likely intensified during the period of composition by the deaths of his children. One of the most personal of all his major works, the Stabat mater sets the tone for the equally large-scale St Ludmila oratorio of 1886 and the Requiem of 1890: sorrow and consolation are the Requiem’s key-signatures, just as devout belief infuses the Czech legend of St Ludmila. The Mass in D was originally composed in 1887 with organ accompaniment, but the carefully integrated nature of his setting is in the spirit of the late Masses by Haydn and Schubert, as he recognized by orchestrating it a few years later. His final sacred work is the elementally exuberant Te Deum of 1892, which looks back in spirit to his robust and festive setting of Psalm 149.

The sonatas on this album, from his Opp. 9, 10 and 12 collections, reveal both his admiration for Mozart and his own tendencies towards Classicism, in dialogue with the French galant style, with the melodic traits of the Italian operatic style, and with the virtuosic formulae of the innovative piano music associated with Muzio Clementi. The six Balletti are more modest in scale and probably intended for domestic use by amateurs. On the other hand, the Caprice Op.8 undoubtedly addresses the power and dynamic range of the new piano, with an innovative, unresolved conclusion on the dominant. Born in the Trento region of Italy, Ferrari studied music in Verona and could play the flute, oboe, violin, viola and double bass by the age of twenty. He became friends with both Paisiello and Thomas Attwood, the friend and contemporary of Mozart, whose quartets dedicated to Haydn made a deep impact on the young Ferrari. Having written operas in Naples, in 1792 he moved to London, where he met Haydn and Clementi and quickly became a leading singing teacher, with the Princess of Wales among his pupils. It was there that he achieved his most lasting professional success. He wrote a pair of piano concertos, and about 50 sonatas. The instrument used in this recording is a replica of a five-and-a-half octave 1804 Walter und Soehne fortepiano, built by Paul McNulty in 2008. Like Ferrari, Stefania Neonato hails from the Trento region; she is now professor of fortepiano at the Musikhochschule in Stuttgart, and her activities in teaching, performance and recording are concentrated on Classical-era music for fortepiano.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=BRI95646&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Germany,2018 Brilliant Classics,2018 Brilliant Classics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In fact an aesthetic conversation between Italy and Germany underlies the character of the album as a whole. Kittel, Krebs and Vogler were pupils of J.S. in Leipzig, and their work featured here is indebted to a greater or lesser extent to the example of their master; whereas his most talented son, C.P.E., struck out boldly in new directions of harmony and voicing, as demonstrated here by a C minor Fantasy and Fugue and the substantial A minor Sonata. The cousin of Pachelbel, Walther, like Bach, made many transcriptions for organ of concertos by Vivaldi and his contemporaries such as Corelli and Torelli.

Thus the qualities of affection and lightheartedness were established early in the history of the serenade, and they continued to be respected and exploited throughout the Romantic era. The outdoor serenade was naturally better suited to wind instruments, with their greater volume and carrying power, but a string band was more appropriate for tender and amorous expressions. Alone of the Romantics, Dvorák composed an example of each, and his Serenade for Strings is notably more relaxed and longer-limbed. However, the high watermark for the string serenade in the late 19th century was set by Tchaikovsky, with a masterpiece that recalls the example of his beloved Mozart. With his neoclassical Holberg Suite, Grieg looked back further still, to the world of Baroque dances. Some of the most rewarding but least-known music in the release is also Scandinavian in origin: the two symphonically scaled Novelettes of Niels Gade. Yet more heartfelt is the early Serenade by Josef Suk, and this work from 1892 set the tone for the more impassioned works for string orchestra that would be written, still in a broadly Romantic vein, during the first half of the last century.

In bringing this endeavour to a close the group have returned to their starting point, recording a fresh take of perhaps the most famous set, Monteverdi’s groundbreaking Books V & VI, previously released by Le Nuove Musiche one decade ago at the start of this musical journey. With these two books of madrigals Monteverdi unequivocally made his forward-thinking position clear in the heated debate over musical aesthetics that had been raging fiercely in Florentine artistic circles. Defying his critics, he distanced himself from conservative practices by declaring his own methods a ‘second practice’, the seconda prattica. He abandoned the confines of a single mode, freely adding piquant dissonance to underpin emotionally charged words in the text, thus heightening the drama. He also began exploiting the basso continuo as an independent harmonic foundation for melody – the dawn of monody, a solo-and-accompaniment style that would surpass polyphony as the basis for the music of so many later generations of composers. Le Nuove Musiche’s approach to Monteverdi is both dedicated and informed. They bring the past into the present, considering questions that were asked in the Renaissance and are still relevant in our present musical landscape, thereby making Early Music as new today as any other, while maintaining the highest standards of performance authenticity.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=BRI95659&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Germany,2018 Brilliant Classics,2018 Brilliant Classics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Federico Bardazzi duly obliges with this recreation of Easter at the Basilica San Marco, around the year 1600. Chants alternate with spectacular, antiphonal toccatas and canzonas that bounce off the walls of the generous church acoustic, as well as a slight but still exuberant sonata by Giovanni Paolo Cima. Enclosed within are the separate movements of the four-part Mass by Monteverdi, and the liturgical reconstruction concludes with a setting of the Ave maris stella which, like the Mass, is to be found in Monteverdi’s collection of Selva morale e spirituale, no less treasurable in its way than the better-known Vespers compilation. Indeed the Selva morale dates from several decades later in Monteverdi’s output and reflects an even greater harmonic refinement: the linear polyphony of the Mass obeys the rules of the stile antico, while the psalm settings and hymns such as Laudate Dominum and Cantate Domino belong to the more sectional and vividly illustrative style of the seconda pratica which became particularly associated in his work and that of his successors with the secular madrigal. Bardazzi notes that Monteverdi would have expected to perform this music with a mixed-voice choir; the male-only ensemble is a late-19th-century practice. His lively tempi and instrumental arrangements, switching between basso continuo and colla parte instruments, are intended ‘to allow Monteverdi’s creative genius and originality to permeate the strict counterpoint.’",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=BRI95747&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Germany,2018 Brilliant Classics,2018 Brilliant Classics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I am a great admirer of Ella Fitzgerald, Billie Holiday, Peggy Lee and other jazz legends. Their recordings are still amongst my favorites. I did not dare take on this repertoire for a long time, however, because I am of the opinion that each artist should stick to his or her own style. However, I was inspired by listening to the songs of Cole Porter performed by Frederica von Stade, whom I admire greatly. Without in any way endeavoring to alter her singing style, she gave Porter’s songs great charm and brought them into a different, interesting dimension.

Synthesis has had the privilege of sharing America’s music- jazz- with many countries of the world, including Japan, China, Brazil, Russia, and much of Europe. We need no translation when we play; people everywhere feel and love jazz, and much goodwill ahs been fostered through our performances. I have tried before to record the band at the end of a tour with no success because of our being jet lagged and brain-dead. We decided this time to bring good microphones and record every concert and see what we could get. Thankfully, Jeff Carter traveled with us to engineer these recordings. It’s amazing that he took these sounds from mostly outdoor performances- in shopping plazas and even in the woods. I hope you enjoy the recordings as much as we enjoyed playing these amazing tunes!” Synthesis is a musical melding of some of the finest musicians at Brigham Young University.

Regarded as a French composer, Hahn was actually born in Venezuela, returning to Paris at the age of three and showing a prodigious talent for music- entering the Paris Conservatoire aged just ten to study composition with Massenet and Saint-Saens- and like his teachers, he worked in a strongly melodic and tonal idiom. The main works here are a Piano Quartet and a Piano Quintet. His Quintet of 1921 has an arresting opening, with fluid piano writing and idiomatic and effective writing for the strings. It is a hugely underrated work in the repertoire. The Quartet is a very late work and smaller in scale than the quintet, but nonetheless a substantial and robust piece. The melodies are included in Hahn’s own instrumental transcriptions.

His second trio, composed once he had achieved international fame and experienced marriage breakdown and the loss of his beloved mother, seems more serious in tone and, it could be argued, reflects this. Although Saint-Saens himself cautioned strongly against the incorporation of subjective emotions into music saying “Art is intended to create beauty and character, feeling only comes afterwards and art can very well do without it. In fact, it is very much better off when it does.” Benjamin Fith, pianist, writes in his introduction to the album: “He was ahead of his time in authentic performance practice habits and an understanding of the classical repertoire, far exceeding that of most of his romantic contemporaries. Saint-Saens’ very long life took him through the Romantic period well into the age of Debussy and early Stravinsky. Out of kilter with the latter era, for many years he had the reputation of a musical reactionary.

In a long unknown transcript from Mozart's time, the 25 individual movements are arranged differently and supplemented by five arrangements of opera arias, resulting in 30 ""Terzetti"", as Mozart himself called it. Originally set for three basset horns, there are already alternative voices from the early days - the starting point for the Trio Lézard.

Both men were championing a singspiel in three acts premiered at the National Theater in Berlin on 6 July 1798 and performed fifty-five more times at this house until 1825. The authors of this successful work were the Gotha-born Friedrich Wilhelm Gotter and Friedrich Hildebrand of Einsiedel and its composer was the Königsberg native Johann Friedrich Reichardt. After a short phase as a brilliant violin virtuoso Reichardt, who was influenced by the philosophy of the Enlightenment, became a pathbreaking “thinking artist” who soon met with recognition in various European countries as a composer and versatile writer active in many fields. With simple means Reichardt’s music seeks, in keeping with the particular situation, to do justice to the tension between the “gentle melodies” of delightful spirit voices and the horrors of hell. It is primarily in his ensemble and final scenes that this composer produces a complexity that he had learned from Gluck and Mozart.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=777548-2&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Opera,Germany,2018 CPO,2018 CPO,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was here that the opera, now finally being released as a recording, celebrated its premiere on 28 November 2010. A closer examination of the opera reveals that there is much more to it than a lighthearted operetta; here we have a farcical, fantastic drama à la E. T. A. Hoffmann in which grotesque exaggeration renders tolerable the depths and perils of human existence. Dance forms pervade the music, contributing to the characterization of the social class depicted in the plot of the opera while also offering an overview of the “light tone” intended by Reznicek for this work; polonaise, foxtrot, Boston lente, and Tempo di Valse numbers occur along with a tango and a Galop presto.

He did not have much success in the United States, suffered while in exile, and took his own life in 1967. Wallenstein was completely forgotten, certainly also because of the great challenges posed by its performance. Cornelius Meister, the principal conductor of the Vienna Radio Symphony Orchestra, writes, “Along with a large chorus and orchestra, there are numerous stage musicians who are divided into three groups, even so as to include table music with a harpsichord, a large military band, and trumpets. Weinberger has a different style featured in each of the six scenes, and the absolutely indescribable manifoldness extends from the operetta, atonality, and music of folk character to romantically ramified counterpoint, so that one almost has the impression that several composers are at work.” The opera is based on Friedrich Schiller’s trilogy of the same name on the subject of the downfall of the famous General Wallenstein during the Thirty Years’ War.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=777963-2&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Opera,Germany,2018 CPO,2018 CPO,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, over the years his music for piano has been overshadowed by his many songs and choral compositions. Lindblad wrote some sixty pieces for piano, but the majority still only exist in manuscript. A couple of years ago, Oscar Ekberg decided to study Lindblad’s entire piano oeuvre, and this is the result: the very first recorded compilation of Lindblad’s piano music. The recording consists of a selection of character pieces and ‘Songs without words’. The short character piece was Lindblad’s preferred form, and he was clearly a master of this brief evocation of mood. Oskar Ekberg grew up in Sweden where he began studying piano at age six. After studying at the School of Music in Gothenberg, he continued post-graduate studies at the Royal College of Music in Stockholm. In 2003, he graduated and made his official debut with a performance of Prokofiev’s second piano concerto with the Swedish Radio Symphony Orchestra.

Geroge Enescu‘s Suite op. 10 No. 2 even has the title Des cloches sonores (Eng. Sonorous Bells), and the bell sounds are unmistakeably audible in all four movements of the Suite, albeit in very differing dynamics and atmospheric sound colors. The G major Sonata op. 78 D 894 by Franz Schubert is a piece with which I have a long and close association. What greatly influenced my interpretation of the famous first movement was my contemplation of the long, expansive chords – these sounds as if they are produced by a far-away bell in a quiet, profound landscape. The impressive ending and the highlight of the Sonata No. 5 op. 53 by Alexander Scriabin uses the very gentle harmonies and individual notes of the beginning, which develop from distant tolling bell to become an overpowering, mighty peal of bells.“",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=DGCD21107&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Germany,,2017 Dreyer Gaido,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Putting early music in new settings is an essential part of Brisk’s identity.

Modern composers have been invited by Brisk to write a musical comment on a certain style or composition. All these things can be heard on this album with music from Spain and Portugal.

On this new release from Glossa (where Senn is operating with a rich and deep bass-baritone coloring to his voice) there are not just the two principal Bach cantatas for solo bass – Ich will den Kreuzstab gerne tragen, BWV 56 and Ich habe genug, BWV 82 – but also the third and more rarely aired work, Der Friede sei mit dir, BWV 158, in which the soloist is joined by a chorus of sopranos.

Bach: Piano Concertos, Vol. 5",Michael Rische; Berliner Barock Solisten,1,CD,14.81,22.99,"What happened in Leipzig in 1733 was crucial to the development of a musical genre that has been an integral part of the music scene for over two hundred years: the keyboard concerto. That year, Johann Sebastian Bach wrote his great Concerto in D minor BWV 1052 and his second oldest son Carl Philipp Emanuel, aged just 19, composed his first keyboard concerto, the Concerto Wq 1 in A minor. Anyone who directly compares the two concertos will hardly believe that they were both written in the same place and at the same time: on the one hand, the elder Bach’s harpsichord piece, which plumbs the deepest depths of polyphony; on the other, the younger Bach’s new approach to keyboard-writing, a style that almost seems to overlook the omnipresent tradition of counterpoint. Setting aside the extremely complicated compositional history of JS Bach’s harpsichord concerto — from the presumed adaptation of an oboe concerto by Benedetto Marcello through to the arrangement of Bach’s own violin concerto for keyboard by his son Emanuel (BWV 1052a) — what is certain is that the younger Bach did not simply inherit the keyboard concerto as a genre from the hands of his father; he played a decisive part in shaping and enriching it from the outset. Another point to note is that the composer’s artistic identity fundamentally changed during this period: the truths of faith ceased to be the focal point, eclipsed by principles of the Enlightenment, namely self-assurance and self-reliance.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=HC17034&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Germany,2017 Deutschlandfunk Kultur,2017 Profil,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its four tracks present innovative approaches to instruments, novel deployment of electronic processing, and what might be the strangest ‘orchestra’ ever recorded. The album is at times serious, at times chaotic, at times sinister, but the underlying character is one of ‘play’: adventure, joy, exchange, even a certain mischievousness. Katherine Young is one of the leading voices of her generation, a composer whose work often defies categorization. Here we see her at her most spare and unadorned – a bassoon and a collection of effects pedals – but from that setup she conjures an unexpected landscape, overlaid with trumpet-like fanfares and wincing cries. Chris Mercer, likewise, is an artist whose work is difficult to pigeonhole, shifting between acoustic ecology, invented instruments, and interactive technologies. But here Mercer has written no ordinary orchestra piece. Mercer plays all 46 instruments, and as a result this orchestra can do things that orchestras shouldn’t be able to do. Cellos spontaneously morph into clarinets. Brass instruments sprout their own woodwind doublings. Brass players seem equipped with an enormous array of mutes and plungers. Pianos move seamlessly between sixth-tones and quarter-tones as though the instruments were being retuned mid-performance. The third track features Charmaine Lee, an extraordinary improvising vocalist whose unique soundworld is both augmented and lacerated through her partnership with Sam Pluta, one of the most inventive, original, and well-respected improvisers working in electronic music. Finally, Aaron Cassidy, known for his bodily, choreographic approaches to instruments and notation, presents his first purely electronic work to be released. The result of a series of electronic, politically charged improvisations recorded in the early months of 2017, this work is raucous, unruly, volatile and defiant.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=HCR17CD&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,United Kingdom,2018 Huddersfield Contemporary Records,2018 Huddersfield Contemporary Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All this is manifested in the works that Peruvian pianist Claudio Constantini reveals to us in this stunning release, second in a series that presents the recording of the complete piano output of the French composer, in which he performs the 24 Preludes, composed by Debussy in two volumes, the first from 1909 to 1910, while he was already ill with the cancer which would cause his death in 1918, and the second from 1911 to 1913. Together with the first book of Preludes, Claudio Constantini performs the Estampes from 1903 and the Ballade Slave from 1890; and next to the second book of Preludes, his Images oubliées from 1894. Claudio Constantini holds an international and multi-faceted career as a performer of two instruments, the piano and the bandoneon, as well as being a composer in high demand. Born and raised in Lima, Constantini’s unique style is defined by its solid classical roots paired with a passion for popular music genres, among which Latin music and Jazz/fusion play a key role.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=IBS22018&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Spain,2018 IBS Artist,2018 IBS Artist,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At that time, he was a promising composer who, having been brought up in Bohemia, not only spoke German but also demonstrated a profound knowledge of the Central European musical tradition. The composer, with all this, very quickly faced reality: in the Vienna of that time what they wanted of a Czech composer was music that sounded Czech, not German. Of the works he wrote in those years, the one that caught the publisher´s and Brahm´s attention was his song cycle, Moravian Duets. They particularly stood out if we keep in mind, as mentioned by Michael Beckerman, that to the Bohemian composer the Moravian culture was as foreign as any other. This is how history, with its selective forgetfulness, has prolonged for years the European rule that has been to label Dvorak a nationalistic Czech composer and author of various worthy symphonies. That he left more than a hundred songs written, that his inspiration went far beyond Bohemian folklore and that he was one of the most prolific Opera composers of his time are irrelevant questions. This recording from Spanish mezzosoprano Marta Infante and pianist Jorge Robaina gives us an opportunity to hear some songs that seem to have been written out of their time.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=IBS12018&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Spain,2018 IBS Artist,2018 IBS Artist,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The first work, ‘Karasuma: A Fast Funk for Orchestra,’ started life as a classroom exercise at the Donisha Women’s College in Kyoto, Japan, here Kechley demonstrated how acoustic musical fragments could be combined in various ways by computer. The work was so successful it was expanded and premiered by the Boston Pops in 1993. The other major work on the album is a symphony exploring various aspects of dreams, ‘Wakeful Visions/ Moonless Dreams.’ Each of the four movements is associated with literary references; from the Old Testament, a haiku by Buson, the Witches’ scene from Shakespeare’s Macbeth, and musings on remembrance by Marcel Proust.

The combinations afford a wide range of possibilities, from the aggressive noise of a cymbal on piano strings, and peaceful meditations created by finger cymbals gently buzzing on a vibraphone, to the curious thump of a person falling onto a bass drum. Sekhon writes: “I have been heavily influenced by the teachings of Don Juan, specifically those found in the book Journey to Ixtlan. ‘Death is an Adviser’ is a chapter from the book that deals with the awareness of death and how such awareness advises our decision-making in life. The movement titles each have double meanings, which reflect both the philosophy that inspired the piece and the compositional process. I am interested in finding ways for my creative work as a composer and other life activities to intersect and become the same. For this piece, in an effort to work and spend time with my family at once, my daughters and wife drew numbers from a hat to determine pitch orderings, durations, and contour. After selecting numbers for pitch and duration and combining them, we’d run to the piano and play it and hear how it turned out- we made a game of it.”",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=INN988&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Percussion,United States,,2018 Baljinder Sekhon,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These are enthusiasts of their work, people of tireless creative activity, and their course of life is nothing but creative enthusiasm. Such is Heinrich Gustavovich Neuhaus”, wrote Viktor Delson, a remarkable researcher of piano music. The outstanding Polish composer Karol Szymanowski dubbed Neuhaus “Heinrich the Great”. The pianist, educator, author of books, essays and reviews, and brilliant connoisseur of poetry, painting and philosophy, he was fluent in six languages and did not fit in the narrow frames of a mere musical performer. Neuhaus’s concert performances attracted sophisticated connoisseurs who had heard Rachmaninoff and Horowitz and general public at large. Although Neuhaus thought out every interpretation of the works he played, his piano sounded impulsively and passionately as though the music was born straight from under the pianist’s fingers. Neuhaus, who had a talent for composition and rejected a conducting career when he was young, possessed an ability to get the feel of music so that his performances seemed to come from the composers themselves. One of the most prominent piano teachers of the 20th century, Heinrich Neuhaus enjoyed unshakeable authority with his students and fellow teachers. Most of his recordings date back to the late 1940s and early 1950s.

The artistic individuality of Arthur Ancelle, a representative of a renowned artistic family in France, who started his performing career at the age of thirteen, allows us to reckon him among the most interesting pianists of his generation. The graduate of the Ecole Normale de Musique de Paris, he underwent studies with Berlinskaya and Mira Yevtich, and became a prize-winner of a number of prestigious contests. The owner of an extensive repertoire, Ancelle is known for his heightened interest in contemporary music. However, this album is dedicated to the piano works of Joseph Haydn whose 285th anniversary was celebrated last year. The album features two sonatas from Haydn’s “middle” period (Nos 30 and 31) written in the late 1760s and still bearing traces of C.P.E. Bach’s influence, and also one of the best known sonatas in E flat major (1794) filled with deep musical revelations and unexpected turns of the composer’s thought. Arthur Ancelle’s refined sense of style, diversity of the musical palette and noble restraint of playing make him a remarkable interpreter of the founder of the First Viennese School.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=MELCD1002527&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Russia,2017 Arthur Ancelle ,2017 Arthur Ancelle ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A great musician who heard the universe as a powerful, boundless space resounding with the sounds of bells at once both tragic and triumphant, Rachmaninoff left Russia and became a part of a completely different world... As I stood at his grave, I found this space resonating within me. When I returned home, I began writing a piano cycle. In this cycle, Rachmaninoff writes letters to postmodern composers. Rachmaninoff himself was an anti-modernist. He was not a revolutionary, was never ‘ahead of his time,’ and was unafraid of looking old-fashioned. At first glance, it would seem that he bore no influence on late 20th/early 21st century composers. Nonetheless, his invisible, magical presence can in fact be heard in the music of some composers, including so-called ‘contemporary classical’ composers and rock musicians. Likewise when I hear Rachmaninoff’s endless melodies that evolve from a very short motive of literally two or three notes, the word ‘minimalism; all but rolls off my tongue. However, these connections are so subtle and not readily apparent that I wouldn’t want to deaden them by invoking musicological terms. Rachmaninoff thus speaks to the composers that would come after him…”",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=MELCD1002548&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Russia,2013 IE Sergey Krasin,2013 IE Sergey Krasin,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But this is not improvisation. Stockhausen’s score instructs them how to transform what they hear: how they imitate amd modulate it, make it longer or shorter, how to rhythmically articulate it, higher or lower, louder or softer, darker or more playful. Whether they should play and as solo, duo, trio or quartet, etc. Though not so familiar now, at the time short-wave radios made it possible to listen to live radio stations from all over the world. The transmission was not always clean, but disturbed by noises and interferences. Moving from one station to another one could hear Morse-code signals, amateur radio communications and all kind of electronic sounds and noises. Stockhausen wanted this sound world to be part of Kurzwellen. This new version created by C.L.S.I., premiered at the Stockhausen Summer Course in Kurten on August 10th 2011, is a kind of updating of Stockhausen’s one of the 1960s.

The recording by Capella Antiqua Munich under Konrad Ruhland has long since become a classic – because it represents a milestone in the endeavor to portray the topicality of Gregorian chant’s timeless art form. Antiqua Munich was formed in 1951 as one of the forerunner ensembles of the Early Music movement.

Elegies is an aesthetic manifesto, a wish for a turning point in the composer’s creative evolution, but also, more ambitiously, in all future music. Ferruccio Busoni believed that music should be, as he commented to the critic and composer Hans Pfitzner, “well meant and full of peace,” but this did not preclude the provocative gesture of the Elegies’ exceptional harmonic variety, brought about by new chordal progressions and juxtapositions and giving an impression of a potentially inexhaustible tonality. An die Jugend is a collection of four pieces written in 1909 and published as four separate ‘books’ in the same year. These pieces have some stylistic features with Busoni’s first Elegy, while showing even further experimentation on the composer’s part.

Radiant, affirming and occasionally uncanny, the sound is an intricate patchwork of tones where instrumental lines and textures, like uniquely patterned autonomous organisms, shift in and out of alignment to produce a vibrating landscape. The compositions on Strange Paradise require a mode of “extended listening” — slow gradations of change between tone worlds of ambience, rhythm, minimal, and angularity. Tigue is a group of three percussionists with a fluid musical identity. The Brooklyn-based trio (Matt Evans, Amy Garapic and Carson Moody) makes their own kinetic and hypnotic blend of instrumental minimalism while opening up the possibilities of their instrumentation through commissioning and collaboration. Tigue’s debut album Peaks was released in 2015 with New Amsterdam Records with highlighted performances at the Ecstatic Music Festival, Bric Celebrate Brooklyn!

However, in musical forms based on breathing, the voice and wind instruments, a type of duet is performed, which could be described as an “accompanied solo”: one of the musicians, acting as soloist, takes the initiative of choosing the pieces, their developments, their tempo and even the time of his interventions, whereas his fellow musician, most often a disciple, is there to ensure continuity which the soloist would have difficulty in sustaining. By some improbable chance, three of the best musicians in India today happen to have developed, in addition to their own individual talents, the ability to play true ensemble music.

Many of the nobility furnished their courts with instrumentalists or music ensembles, for the entertainment of the master and of the house and his family and guests. Revolution and Napoleonic wars changed the face of society, redistributing economic power. In the years between the Congress of Vienna (1814) and the Revolution of 1848-49, new ways were found to finance and perform instrumental music. It was during this time that Liszt composed his ‘Annees de perelinage,’ and his ‘Premiere Annee. Suisse.’ This release also features the programme music ‘Francois de Paul marchant sur les flots,” which tells the musical story of St. Francis who asks some ferrymen to take him to Sicily from the Calabrian coast, and when they refuse walks across the sea with only his faith in God. Francesco Piemontesi is a pianist of exceptional refinement of expression, which is allied to a consummate technical skill. Widely renowned for his interpretation of Mozart and the early Romantic repertoire, Piemontesi’s pianism and sensibility has a close affinity too with the later 19th century and 20th century repertoire of Brahms, Liszt, Dvorak, Ravel, Debussy, Bartok, and beyond.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=ORF-C944182I&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Austria,2018 ORFEO International Music GmbH,2018 ORFEO International Music GmbH,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is without question a thoroughly contemporary interpretation; we get the now universal sense of hearing anew that comes with period instruments, even though none are being played here. It must have been a real stimulus to the composer at the conductor’s desk – a music analyst in the highest degree – to take this music tamed by over-familiarity and strip it of everything that is pseudo-obvious and safely middle-of-the-road. And it is that principle, faithfully followed in the earlier releases, of quite deliberately comparing and contrasting Mendelssohn’s works with the clarinet-playing conductor’s own that must have been what struck the spark and audibly kindled the music-making spirit of the Irish Chamber Orchestra. A drama otherwise reserved for the concert hall here comes across admirably: the well-known early-19th-century works sound like new, which is a compliment to their interpreters. Widmann’s two early works, now a part of his own history, turn out to be good, even exhilarating, listening; inspired by the young composer’s disco nights, “180 beats” goes well with the fascinating “Fantasie”, played by the composer himself, which effortlessly surmounts the limits seemingly set on the harmonies of a monophonic wind instrument. This is a spine-tinglingly new way to listen to Mendelssohn’s music.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=ORF-C945181A&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Austria,2018 ORFEO International Music GmbH,2018 ORFEO International Music GmbH,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He studied at the Franz Liszt Academy in Budapest, receiving tuition from Geza de Kresz, Leon Weiner and Imre Waldbauer. His musical education as a violinist was further influenced by working with Carl Flesch and Zino Francescatti. Personal contact with Bela Bartok inspired his great interest in Bartok’s musical vision and exploration of Eastern European folk music. In 1972, he was appointed Professor a the University of Washington in Seattle, and Guest Professor at the Boston University. The violin that he is heard playing on this recording is the “Ernst” Stradivari from 1709, which was on loan to him from private benefactors in Hamburg. It is an endearing coincidence that Stradivari made this violin in the very year of Johann Sebastian Bach’s first meeting with violinist Georg Pisendel, who might have inspired him to compose the works of this recording. This recording was hugely important to Denes Zsigmondy; it might be his musical farewell to his wife, and it is also a document of the essence of his own existence. At the 95th anniversary of Zsigmondy’s birth, this remastered version is not only a glimpse into the past, but also into the soul of a human being that must not be forgotten.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=pmr0093&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Germany,2018 Paladino Media,2018 Paladino Media,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

His stature predestined him as a singer for roles of gnomes and dwarves in Rome’s opera scene. Corelli played for a few years in the orchestra directed by Lonati, its concertmaster. One can only marvel at the fact that the virtuoso didn’t publish his collection of 12 sonatas (with 6 “Sonate da camera” and 6 “Sonate da chiesa”) before the year 1701, possibly motivated by the success of Corelli’s own violin sonatas (1701). At his point in time however, Lonati’s compositions were already a few years old and had been copied a number of times. Had he published his works at the time of their creation, his success would have been distinctly greater. Lonati’s virtuosity comes close to that of H.I.F. Biber. The power of expression in his music is surprising, although he cannot disavow the sunny origins of his Italian soul.

The seven symphony anthems included on this recording have been selected from the extant 19 to demonstrate Humfrey’s range of work in the genre. The anthems represent his most substantial contribution to English music and show him to be the country’s leading composer of the early Restoration period.

A Company Principal for 16 years, she has performed all the leading roles in the classical, dramatic and contemporary repertory. This collection showcases her exceptional mastery in four quintessential roles. In Swan Lake, she brings to life the beautifully tragic Odette and her rival Odile. She perfectly portrays the young lover Lise in La Fille mal gardée, and brings bravura and vivacity to the role of Kitri in Carlos Acosta’s production of the classical Don Quixote. She is transcendent as Giselle, one of the most challenging and demanding roles in the repertory. With peerless technical skill and compelling performances by the whole Company, this collection celebrates an exceptional dancer in her prime.

Marianela Nuñez and Acosta delivered sparky, engaging performances"" (The Times (Don Quixote)) ""If the acting is superb, it’s given real authority by the dancing.

Since, however, no opera of Sommer’s could hold its own in the repertoire for any length of time, one overlooked easily the quality of his works and his contribution to the further development of the opera genre. The songs, sung frequently during their lifetime, disappeared from the repertoire of the singers through the time-boundness of the selected poems; Hans Sommer wrote the most important contributions in the area of the art song at a time when his star was already sinking and he no longer had a large audience. The fact that he published his operas and parts of his song making in self-publishing and the publisher Litolff, who had published at least half of the total of about 300 songs Hans Sommers was dissolved in 1940, a possible revival of works by Hans Sommers has been simply impossible until now. Sommer’s final compositions, which are centered mainly on Goethe’s texts, serve as a message to posterity, advocating an intellectual mindset that, throughout his life, was rooted in Naturphilosophie, a philosophical approach to nature that flourished in the German-speaking world in the early 19th century. The selection of texts furthermore bears eloquent testimony to Sommer’s loneliness in his final years and the unwavering “optimism of an incorrigible idealist”.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=SM281&medium=phy,30 World/Int'l.,World,,Germany,2018 Solo Musica,2018 Solo Musica,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Heard together on an album for the first time, the Piano Concertos by Grieg and Delius reveal the full extent of the composers’ friendship and mutual admiration. Composed in 1868, Grieg’s Piano Concerto in A minor has become one of the cornerstones of the repertoire. Its famous opening timpani roll heralds a ravishing display of virtuosity lit up by the melting melody at the heart of an immediately recognizable masterpiece. Also in a minor key, Delius’s C minor Piano Concerto was inspired by a performance of Grieg’s Concerto in London in 1888. Grieg’s gifting of a copy of the score to Delius spurred him on to write his own Concerto. A first draft in 1897 was followed by two further revisions over the next decade before the final version heard here in a rare appearance. Grieg’s mooted Second Piano Concerto was never completed, but the 150 bars he did sketch hint at what might have been. Robert Matthew-Walker has fashioned the existing material – in various stages of completion and detail – into a coherent single movement to give, for the very first time, the clearest indication of what Grieg had in mind for a work left tantalizingly unfinished.

With this idea, I started my exploration of works reflecting the ways the violin (including its ancestors and relatives) is employed in musical settings worldwide.

In the mid-20th century, even as many artists went in overtly avant-garde directions, there were those who, choosing to work within seeming norms of structure, managed to integrate them with their sound-worlds in singularly captivating and moving ways.

She’s been widely praised by critics, both in Denmark and abroad. However, the 32-year-old Windfeld is also generous when it comes to letting others explore the possibilities of her 5-year-old big band – in this case an extremely experienced figure on the Danish jazz scene, saxophonist and composer Thomas Agergaard, who is 23 years Windfeld’s senior. The orchestra is used to Windfeld’s meticulously worked out and prepared compositions. With Agergaard, however, the music is often delivered spontaneously, and some of the compositions were crafted right in the studio, a whole new way for the band to work. “Thomas writes quite differently than I do,” says Kathrine Winfeld, “with many different references to contemporary classical music, among other things, and he often goes in for the free-tonal approach, sometimes the symphonic. He works more spontaneously and thrives on the energy of the moment. This is beneficial to the music, but is also a challenge when we are so many together and have to make something work within a limited time frame.” On this occasion Agergaard utilizes smaller units of the big band while also working brilliantly with the entire ensemble. Part of the repertoire consists of renewed preexisting compositions, such as Different Corner and the vehement Hast, while other compositions such as the ballad, Airborne Lotus, was written just before the recording was made.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=SVL1014313&medium=phy,02 Jazz,Jazz,,EU,2018 Storyville Records,2018 Storyville Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The first recording was made in early 1972, with the orchestra possessing technical brilliance following Karel Ancerl’s era, yet craving intensive emotionality and romantic flight – which they were duly afforded by their new charismatic chief conductor. The sheer magic of the recording is further enhanced by its analogue format, the technique that at the time enjoyed its apex, splendidly mastered by the recording team at the Dvorák Hall of the Rudolfinum in Prague.

His question in fact stood at the birth of Moravian Duets and also marked the beginning of Dvorák’s journey abroad. “Why not, find good lyrics and I will take care of the rest.” When the composer got the first selection of folk songs from Sušil’s collection, he decided to take only the lyrics and provide them with his own tunes. As soon as the duets got into the hands of Johannes Brahms (who was a member of a committee that assessed Dvorák’s application for a state scholarship), the well-established composer did not hesitate to recommend them to his Berlin publisher Fritz Simrock. “When you play them, you will enjoy them just as I did, and as a publisher you will especially be pleased by their unique beauty.” It was Simrock who initiated the composition of a four-hand version of the Slavonic Dances that led to Dvorák’s first major international success. The present recording is unique in another aspect as well: the complete set of 23 Moravian Duets have been played and recorded on Dvorák’s original grand piano, a 1879 Bösendorfer that is a pride of the Antonín Dvorák Museum in Prague. The challenge was taken hold of by young musicians who are not only crowned by international laurels but also possess a sensitivity both for the charm of Dvorák’s songs and the unique timbres of the instrument touched by the composer’s own hands.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=SU4238-2&medium=phy#,01 Classical,Classical,,Czech Republic,2018 Supraphon a.s.,2018 Supraphon a.s.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Ravel recording from May 1974 represents another unforgettable musical experience and no doubt also one of the best Ravel creations ever performed by Moravec. What is more, the recording of the Grieg concert played in December 1984 is the only recording made public by the virtuoso pianist. Microphones have captured Ivan Moravec in his top shape, his play possessing romantic flight, ferocity and a wide range of timbre nuances on the one hand, and remarkable preciseness on the other.
