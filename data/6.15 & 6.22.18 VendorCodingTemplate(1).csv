The difference not only in microphone technique but also in the performer's state of mind and how he projects his playing has a profound impact on the listening experience.

He started as a pupil of Johann Michael Haydn, and later had close ties with his older Joseph Haydn. During his life he came into contact with almost every composer of fame. He travelled throughout Europe, but didn't stay very long in one place. It is assumed he has written about 2,000 works. Among them are 50 masses, three funeral services and four Requiems. In 1816 Neukomm moved to Rio de Janeiro where he became the music teacher of João VI, Prince Regent of Portugal. It was there one year later, that he composed the monumental Missa Solemnis pro Die acclamationis Johannis VI, intended to salute King João VI's accession to the throne of Portugal and Brazil at the grand ceremony of acclamation that was to take place in 1818. The funeral service recorded here dates from 1838, when Neukomm was living in France. The music of the Requiem isn't a flashy piece of music, as it was written for liturgical use at the funeral. It is the whole structure of this service and the way it should be performed which is very intriguing: The Requiem and the psalm 'De profundis' were to be performed in church, whereas the psalm 'Miserere' and the funeral march were to be performed during the procession which accompanied the corpse to the cemetery. This release, featuring all parts of this service, delivers a nice portrayal of a most fascinating character in the European music scene of the early 19th century.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Release.aspx?id=ACC 24344,01 Classical,Classical,,,2008 & 2009 K617,2018 Note 1 Music,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bucolic pastimes were a favorite subject for these courtly entertainments: Rameau's “heroic pastoral” Daphnis et Égle (1753) is represented by a large number of movements which illustrate its rich orchestration and expressive depth. “Sigiswald Kuijken's Petite Bande play with brisk rhythmicality, clean-cut precision and an engaging stylishness, at the same time not ignoring dynamic contrast.

Here he plays on a design of the French horn that would have been a standard for the 19th century and beyond. The singular sound of this instrument, as heard on this album, harkens back to some of the best virtuosic players of the golden age of the design. The repertoire of Planel, Tomasi, Bozza, Gounod, Dukas, Saint-Saens and others are presented as these composers intended and “heard” their works to be played on this French valved instrument. The technical competence required for each track is unique, as some of them were regarded as a test of the highest level of performance. The Saint-Saens and Gounod tracks are included as examples of the pure vocal treatment of the horn by two of France's greatest composers. The Dukas track was the first conservatory test-piece for horn to specifically exploit the newly “legitimized” valve instrument. Tomasi describes what he composed in this way: “I write for the public at large. Music that doesn't come from the heart isn't music.” Listening to this album will give you a peek into a world of the French horn which has seldom been heard, and certainly not in one collection such as this, played by one of the instrument's best and most studied masters.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Release.aspx?id=AF1803,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Chamber Music,United States,2018 Affetto Records,2018 Affetto Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Penna,1,CD,13.25,20.99,"Every song is a journey: a voyage of the human experience explored through the intersection of poetry and music. In fact, a song serves as a natural extension of the original poem that allows us to experience words in a new and insightful way. A composer of songs is then also a poet: a creator of profound meaning through text, meter, harmony, texture, and lyricism. The great English composer Benjamin Britten (1913-1976) is a prime example. A great lover of poetry throughout his life, and friend to such great poets as W. H. Auden, it is difficult to think of another song composer who consistently chose poems of such high quality and breadth to set to music. Furthermore, Britten seems to fall in line as the rightful successor to Franz Schubert in the way he virtually composes the essence of a poem musically. On this recording by outstanding tenor Eric Rieger and renowned accompanist JJ Penna, we explore the Poet's Journey in three of Britten's most important song cycles, each of which is bound to the works of a great poet: Michelangelo, Thomas Hardy, and John Donne. In each work, we discover Britten's gift of lyricism, superb understanding of the voice, and exceptional pianistic capabilities. One finds a clear reverence to Henry Purcell through the use of florid, expansive setting of text and the use of ancient compositional techniques such as the ground bass. Britten skillfully combines these concepts with modern influences to create something unique and exciting. This album is, without doubt, one of the finest collections of Benjamin Britten's gift to the world of music.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Release.aspx?id=AF1804,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Chamber Music,United States,2018 Affetto Records,2018 Affetto Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the case of Brahms, a series of questions that form only one of several important interpretative criteria for other composers emerge as the performer's principal task: What emotions are expressed in the score? How does the musical structure hold it all together? What are the interconnections between the motives? How much interpretative freedom is required or, in some places, permitted? These questions arise almost everywhere in the score, which makes playing his music so very exciting and fulfilling. Brahms places exceptionally high demands on the performer, and yet, the greatest difficulty lies in navigating the tension between the overwhelming emotional intensity on the one hand and an ever-present clarity of form on the other.

La Falena was premiered in Venice on September 6, 1897 and proved not only in step with the literature and painting of the time but also anticipated coming trends in opera: Pelléas et Mélisande would not appear until 1902, Salome not until 1905. Even Illica & Mascagni's Iris with its floral-inspired symbolism was not staged until 1898. The truly new and most original element of La Falena is the extraordinary presence of the orchestra and its life-giving language, which is all modulation and excursions into rare key signatures, leading many experts to dub Smareglia a Wagnerian. This was not simply because of the three evocative preludes but also Smareglia's use of the orchestra.

A brilliant, lively personality from both a humanistic and artistic point of view emerges from the documents. Modern critics have included him in the indistinct group of 'lesser' names from the period of Bellini and Donizetti, acknowledging his ability and primary role in the buffo genre, considering with equally close attention his later writing in the serious genre. Rossi's Il domino nero was staged for the first time at Milan's Teatro alla Canobbiana on September 1, 1849. The subject was used for the first time in the libretto Eugene Scribe wrote for Le domino noir, an opera comique in three acts by Daniel Auber, successfully staged at the Salle de la Bourse in Paris on December 2, 1837 and performed by Laure Cinti Damoreau and Joseph-Antoine-Charles Couderc. Rubino kept the period and the setting in Spain and used some of the ideas, but in substance moved away from Scribe's plot. As well as the adaptability and technical ability in belcanto style, the singers must have first-rate acting talent. Rossi had the gift of simplicity and a 'modern' sensitivity, which goes beyond Rossini and Donizetti's great teaching.

This release gathers all of Porpora's manuscript works for solo cello and continuo, including some pieces currently or formerly attributed to the Neapolitan composer based on musicological evidence. Given the popularity of the solo cello among composers of the Neapolitan school and Porpora's own mastery of the instrument, the existence of a substantial body of work in this genre is not surprising. The new attributions to Porpora have come from recent research conducted at the New York Public Library. One manuscript in the Harrach Collection has revealed the Sonata à violoncello solo & basso del Sig.r Nicolò Porpora in A, which appears alongside two works matching known Porpora compositions from the set of Six sonatas published by Walsh in London. Another manuscript groups two anonymous sonatas with a third matching Porpora's known F major Sonata, published by Schott in an edition by Piatti. Though the Concerto in A minor – part of the Bologna State Archive's Malvezzi Campeggi collection – has recently been attributed to Porpora's contemporary Nicola Fiorenza, it is included here because Porpora's name does appear on the score and because it has been argued that Porpora wrote the work while in Venice teaching at the Ospedale degli Incurabili. Porpora's continual quest for new colors spurred solo cellist and Musica Perduta's musical director Renato Criscuolo to assign a range of different continuo forces to the sonatas: cello and harpsichord, double bass and harpsichord, and a particularly Neapolitan long-necked lute, the colascione, with archlute.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Release.aspx?id=BRI95279,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Baroque Era,Germany,2018 Brilliant Classics,2018 Brilliant Classics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bach and Kuhnau, the Italian organist and keyboard performer has turned his attention to the less-familiar output of Giovanni Benedetto Platti (1697-1763). As his dates might imply, Platti's career and music bridged the evolution from Baroque to Classical idioms, much in the same manner as Bach's son Carl Philipp Emanuel did, and with a comparable brilliance of invention. The influence of Italian Baroque masters such as Corelli, Vivaldi and Marcello is plainly heard in the sprightly cast of his quick melodies and their working out over a solid ground bass. However, Platti was also acclaimed as a singing teacher, as well as being a renowned singer in his own right. Many passages in his sonatas are endowed with the native Italian lyricism of opera, though in fact Platti left Venice for Germany in 1722 and established himself at a royal court in Würzburg. Platti's long career in Germany left its mark on his music in terms of harmonic and formal innovation: many movements in these sonatas take unpredictable detours into remote keys, and the slow movements such as the Larghetto aria of the Second are cast in a plaintive, melancholy mood that bears passing resemblance to the slow dances in the English Suites of Bach. This reconciliation of Venetian Baroque with nascent bel canto and German rationalism makes Platti's sonatas an object example of the stile galante which is gaining ever more attention on record thanks to the rediscovery of many hitherto unheard works in the modern age. Stefano Molardi performs them on this album with three different instruments according to the character of each work: a German-model fretted clavichord, a harpsichord built on a 17th-century Italian model, and a 1713 organ by Giuseppe Bonatti, to be found in the Sanctuary of the Blessed Virgin of Valverde in the province of Brescia.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Release.aspx?id=BRI95518,01 Classical,Classical,,Germany,2018 Brilliant Classics,2018 Brilliant Classics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The range of sonority is wide yet subtle in the set of three Folios (1974) which became his first work for the instrument, yet their brevity is out of all proportion to the care taken in their construction, and they quickly made their composer renowned, along with Henze, as one of the most refined composers for the instrument in the second half of the last century. Takemitsu's explanation of the title was characteristically laconic: 'just two facing pages, short pieces, no more than that.' Within the third of them is buried a quotation from a chorale used by Bach in the St Matthew Passion, hinting at a grave character that is shared by the more overtly Hispanic figuration of the second movement. From 13 years later, the four movements of All in Twilight are an impressionistic evocation in sound of a painting of the same name by Paul Klee. Takemitsu's fondness for bell-like sonorities returns in the minute-long tribute to the composer Sylvano Bussotti on his 60th birthday. Landscape and painting stimulated the composer's imagination in two more guitar pieces: Equinox, he explained, was inspired by the painting of the same name by the Catalan painter, Joan Miro (1967). In the Woods was Takemitsu's very last composition, completed in November 1995, three months before his death. This three-movement suite opens with Wainscot Pond, after a painting of Cornelia Foss – a tone-painting in his late style which is pared back to harmonic essentials and returns to a diatonic harmony that he never quite forsook at his most avant-garde.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Release.aspx?id=BRI95539,01 Classical,Classical,,Germany,2018 Brilliant Classics,2018 Brilliant Classics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This album of 12 harpsichord suites offers ample evidence of his creative gifts. The suites were published in two volumes in London in 1714. When Handel heard of this publication, he sent for a copy and in his own words, 'without hesitation, played it through': no mean compliment! Doubtless Handel recognized a kindred spirit. Mattheson's own style is genial and fluent, tending towards the more audience-pleasing character of Handel's suites rather than the more rigorous keyboard music of Bach. These suites also have their light-hearted and humorous moments, qualities which characterize many of Telemann's instrumental works: indeed it's notable how free Mattheson's music is from the pedantic and academic character of at least some of his writing. Several suites open with a prelude of showy, toccata-like character before the standard Baroque sequence of dance movements such as vigorous and syncopated gigues and gentle sarabandes. The last three suites are the grandest of the twelve, opening with spacious Overtures or in the case of No.10 a symphony, rejoicing in both counterpoint and a sense of high ceremony. Within the 12th are embedded adaptations of three pieces by Mattheson's contemporary Georg Ludwig Böhm: a stylish example of the borrowing that was common practice at the time.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Release.aspx?id=BRI95588,01 Classical,Classical,,Germany,2018 Brilliant Classics,2018 Brilliant Classics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

His partnership with the instrument-maker John Broadwood resulted in significant technical developments to the fortepiano which would be imitated abroad and capitalized upon in Vienna by Beethoven, notably the extra power and larger range. The Sonata Op.25 No.2 in D has become famous under the name 'La Matinée': a subtitle work that conveys the lively spirit of the sonata and its irresistible sense of good cheer even in the lyric simplicity of the third-movement Larghetto. The three Op.39 sonatas are more elaborate in conception and design without forsaking the earlier work's transparency and grace. The first movements of Op.39 abound in brilliant figuration, which evidently played to the composer's strengths as a performer, but they are strongly rooted in a sonata-form structure which contrasts a pressing and vivacious first theme with the more tripping, light-hearted character of the second. The concluding Rondos tend to be the highlight, alternating some surprisingly passionate and even stormy episodes with the kind of unpretentious folk-like theme that Schubert would go on to perfect. This is the second in a projected eight-album series to be published by Brilliant Classics, surveying the complete keyboard sonatas of Dussek. The series was launched in fine style by the Dutch fortepianist Bart van Oort, and it is attracting much critical attention which this addition to the series is sure to share.

They must have been among the first works with which Giovanni Bononcini (1670-1747) sought to make an impression on the discerning audiences and business-minded entrepreneurs who, at the time, were instrumental to a music-rich environment that made the city one of the main centers of European culture. It is perhaps to the detriment of his posthumous reputation that Bononcini became known as Handel's direct rival for the favor of London's musical public: the rivalry between the two men was even immortalized in a piece of satirical doggerel which popularized the English expression 'Tweedledum and Tweedledee'. In fact these divertimenti scored a popular success as soon as they were published; so much so that these harpsichord transcriptions were quickly produced – and then republished two decades later, when they appeared as Suites de Pièces pour le Clavecin, placing them in direct competition with the collection of works under the same name by Handel. The divertimenti are three- and four-movement works designed not to place any great strain upon the listener's attention: the longest movement here lasts barely three minutes. Even the slow movements are simple arias, originally conceived with a high melody instrument in mind – violin or transverse flute – and conforming to a serene and courtly character. By and large, however, they are filled with lively, dance-like quick movements, cheerful in temperament even when the tonality is minor, as it is in half the divertimenti.

However, he was also gifted at the art of improvisation, which is central to the organist's training, and he later wrote out several of his best improvisations as compositions for posterity. His organ music abounds in the elegance and impetuous vitality which characterize his music in general, while his lifelong immersion in the music of Bach is evident in both the counterpoint and the chorale movements to be found throughout his organ sonatas. Matthias Havinga plays three of the best-known of those sonatas on this album: Op.65 Nos 3, 4 and 6. No.3 concludes in a lovely song without words, a style which he revisited for the Andante tranquillo of No.4. No.6, by contrast, opens with a magnificent set of variations upon the 'Our Father' chorale theme Vater unser in Himmelreich, elaborated with such mastery by Bach in the Clavierübung III. Three standalone movements include an energetic E minor fugue and a much more introverted, even melancholic F minor fugue (a cousin to the despairing F minor string quartet which became his last major composition). The Allegro in D minor begins in brilliant and pianistic fashion (perhaps also owing something to Bach's D major Prelude and Fugue BWV532) before seguing into a chorale and fugue. The arrangements are of the overture to his oratorio St Paul (transcribed by the English organist W.T.

The two lais on this recording are found in a manuscript songbook known as the Noailles Chansonnier from c.1300. In the anonymous Plainte de la Vierge au pied de la croix the Virgin Mary speaks in first person in a figurative lament at the foot of the cross. The Lai de Notre Dame, attributed to 13th-century troubadour Ernoul 'Le Vieux' or 'Le Vielle', begins with the author's promise to keep faith with the Virgin Mary and serve no other woman, a pledge quite reminiscent of those of Alfonso X of Castile in his Cantigas de Santa Maria, one of the largest collections of monophonic songs from the Middle Ages. The Cantigas, attributed to King Alfonso X (1221–1284), were written in early-Medieval Galician-Portuguese, fashionable as a lyrical language in Castile at the time. In Santa Maria loei, e loo e loarei, the king thanks the Virgin Mary for her kindness and protection. Nenbressete, Madre de Deus deals with Mary's role as mediator – in medieval eyes, her primary function. It was composed as a contrafactum on Recordare, translating the antiphon into Galician-Portuguese and expanding it with new musical and poetic concepts. Virgen Madre groriosa, a contrafactum on the estampie 'Reis Glorios' by French troubadour Giraut de Bornelh, binds this album together, demonstrating the relationship between the Galician-Portuguese and French lyrics. To the members of Malandança, medieval music is a field in which both performance and scholarship are unavoidable and interdependent subjects.

Chamber music continued to be Bonporti's preferred creative outlet, at a time when cantatas and increasingly operas obtained wider favor, and his increasingly strenuous attempts to gain royal or aristocratic preferment by dedicating and sending his works to kings, queens and princes proved ever fruitless: he died as he worked, a humble cleric. Bonporti's gifts as a composer only began to be fully appreciated a century ago, and he can now be regarded among the most gifted north Italian composers of his generation, his music even worthy at points of being mistaken for Bach's, as it has been more than once in confused manuscript collections. The language of Corelli lies behind Bonporti's idiom in these trio sonatas, but his creative imagination ranged far and wide, not indebted to any local or popular idiom but always sympathetically conceived for his instruments, and for the violin in particular. The slow movements are more developed than most contemporary Italian comparisons; at all points Bonporti's imaginative harmony and lively part-writing can be enjoyed by any listener who is keen to look beyond the tried and tested trio sonata repertoire. Founded in 2006, Associazione Labirinti Armonici is an early-music ensemble of flexible formation, led by scholarship and close study of manuscripts and critical editions in its revival of repertoire from the Baroque.

This orchestra has Haydn's music in its blood, and its interpretation of his symphonies demonstrates a supreme confidence, musical sophistication and lightness of touch. As a noted American music critic remarked following a performance of the Oxford Symphony conducted by Leonard Bernstein: “Let's have no further argument: the Vienna Philharmonic is the world's greatest orchestra. Bernstein's interpretations of the symphonies have consistently met with unreserved critical acclaim.

La Sfera Armoniosa, founded in 1992, is a Dutch Baroque ensemble and orchestra specializing in the performance of music from the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Artistic director Mike Fentross writes: “I was really moved when I heard my orchestra playing the opening bars of Purcell. I heard a sound that was quite different to what I knew from other present-day baroque orchestras. Was this sound closer to that of Purcell's own orchestra, a sound that he may have had in mind when composing this wondrous music? In the very first chat I had about this project with Lidewij van der Voort, our new concertmaster, we talked about the modern adaptations that are often (and understandably) applied to baroque instruments nowadays, and about the possibility of going back to authentic strings (completely bare gut) and a 17th century bow hold (the French grip) for this Purcell project. As it happens, I'd had a similar conversation not long before that with Lidewei de Sterck, our principal oboist, about authentic reeds (scraped from the inside) and with Graham Nicholson, about 17th century trumpets (natural trumpets with no fingerholes). These aspects, seemingly just details, have a major impact not just on the sound but also the way of playing and therefore on the way we interpret the music. We all felt the need to record this album with these 'experimental' instruments.

Four female singers with an enchanting fusion in unison and large spectra in polyphonic singing, along with the tonal colors of multi-instrumentalist Michael Popp, represent the musical extension and interpretation of the church space. The program consists of sacred music that evolved up to the Gothic period. At its center is the Tournai Fair held in the 14th century. It is regarded as the earliest testimony of a mass, which was entirely set to music, as evidenced by medieval manuscripts. During the Gothic period, Paris was one of the most important cultural centers from whence the new Gothic spirit spread throughout Europe. The intellectual elite of this period gathered around its large cathedral and many new compositions of the 13th century emanated from this environment, the so-called “Notre Dame School”. The compositions, like the Tournai Mass, are part of a high culture of music – music that could probably only be heard in the great cathedrals. VocaMe combines this with more folk-like or modest melodies from the Codex Calixtinus (book of Saint James) and the Las Huelgas Codex, among others. Thus, a Gothic soundscape emerges, ranging from simple monophony to the splendor of medieval polyphony.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Release.aspx?id=CHR77420,01 Classical,Classical,,Germany,2018 Note 1 Music,2018 Note 1 Music,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite the rather weak libretto, the stage work has its merits and captivates, for example, with fresh, catchy melodies that, although they cannot deny the influence of Rossini and Donizetti, are by no means imitative. Only in this opera does Verdi combine his renowned depth of musical characterization with the turbulent entanglements of opera buffa.

The multi-layered music fires the imagination and is a rewarding challenge for listeners and pianists alike. I very much enjoyed working on these pieces; they are not only a real pleasure to play, but also take me on a wonderful journey on which I can encounter Debussy. From D'autre part via Ombres-tristesse, Un beau brin de fille, Monsieur Croche-Double Croche and Cloches up to the impetuosity of Bateau-ivre we are repeatedly confronted with extreme opposites. Spontaneity and freedom are juxtaposed by mechanical severity. Individual motifs from Debussy's Préludes flash up. The subtlest pianissimo passages, tender glissandos and bell-like sounds are 'pushed aside' in the next movement by brusque martellato chord clusters, and the consistent utilization of the sostenuto pedal leaves behind vibrant traces of sound. An intensely individual music, which perpetuates Debussy's concept of new tonal aesthetics in our time.” First prize-winner of the 'Jugend musiziert' competition, finalist at the Clara-Haskil Competition in Vevey/Switzerland, and prize-winner at the Gian Battista Viotti International Music Competition in Vercelli, Julia Bartha achieved the leap on to major podiums of the German-speaking and wider international world at an early age.

In the case of Henri Marteau this disappearance was occasioned in part by the circumstance that some of his compositions remained unpublished. Today the violinist Henri Marteau is known mostly only to specialists or fans of Max Reger's music. After all, during the early years of the twentieth century Marteau was an important violin interpreter of Reger's works. The close association between Marteau and Reger, who arranged Marteau's Cello Concerto for piano in 1905, the year of the publication of the String Quartet No. 2, is sometimes quite evident here and in many other works by him. However, the contrapuntal intricacy of Marteau's quartet also holds in store chromatic passages more reminiscent of Nielsen and his Quartet in E flat major op. 14 from 1897-98 than Reger's modulations. In its own way the quartet very much anticipates developments far into the twentieth century while exploring all the many gives and takes of German and French musical influence.

Vol. 2 now follows, just in time for Passiontide. Once again the instrumentation is manifold in its design, and it is here too that we find the key to Graupner's personal style: he captivates his listeners not so much with catchy, easy-to-remember »melodies« as with intensive play with the various tone colors made available to him by the court chapel members and their instruments. For example, while the Cantata for the Third Sunday in Lent exclusively employs stringed instruments, for the Cantata of the Annunciation of Mary Graupner chooses a clearly more colorful instrumentation by additionally using two transverse flutes and two oboes opposing each other as pairs in the opening chorus. The instrumentation of the Bass Aria No. 5 in the cantata exhibits special finesse. Along with the pair of transverse flutes, the first violin part is given an original design: it has tones held for an entire measure in the lowest register on the lowest string, while the two flutes insistently repeat their syncopated motion.

Today the small lute is uniformly termed the “Baroque mandolin” and more rarely the “soprano lute.” The number of composers who wrote attractive works for the mandolin documents the fact that it was then a much-played instrument that musical audiences liked to hear. Accordingly, this new recording brings together concertos, trios, and sonatas by Carlo Arrigoni, Johann Adolf Hasse, Ranieri Capponi, and – of course – Vivaldi. What is particularly surprising here is the so very homogeneous sound of the dialogue between the Baroque mandolin and the Baroque violin – since they are two very different instruments in the field of tonal production. The tonal beauty of both solo parts, with one duo partner supporting the other with accompanying broken chords, produces a captivating effect in the second movement of Vivaldi's Concerto RV 548. The magic of the fascinating tonal idiom of the mandolin and violin duo makes us wish that this rediscovered version will find many delighted listeners.

On our new recording we hear two highly interesting works that once were (and today still are) ascribed to George Frideric Handel. Johann Mattheson, who was working on the setting of the same libretto in 1723, wrote a detailed review of this Passion probably first performed in 1704 and published anonymously. Although Mattheson does not mention the “world-famous” man by name, his choice of words repeatedly offers clear references, for example, when he states that the inscription Pilate had put on the cross caused him “new business” (“neue Händel”). Mattheson doubtless knew exactly who the composer was, and everything that he describes is a perfect match for Handel. For me, there is a lot in the score that recalls the mature Handel while sounding very much like a young man who was then in quest of his individual style. The same applies to the chorale cantata “Ach Herr, mich armen Sünder,” a work certainly suggesting an even earlier date of composition.

The music by Lohse hangs in front of the listener as independent figures- mobiles- and although they constantly show new sides of themselves one recognizes them easily.

His distinctive and grotesque but also poetic and beautiful music is performed by many- especially his beloved little “gymnopedies.” The early 1900s in Paris was an exciting time filled with contradictions and paradoxes, and Satie and his music are a distinct and uncompromising expression. This new release is a truly fascinating take on the French composer Eric Satie. The Danish trio has long experienced great success with their intimate concerts featuring songs and solo music by Satie, and the result is here captured in brilliant sound. Trio Satie is celebrating their tenth anniversary with the release of this album. The group works to arrange music for soprano, double bass and piano- a somewhat unusual trio combination- and cares about presenting and explaining the music in a cultural and historical context of contemporary poetry and visual arts. It gives their concerts shape as a kind of “café concert” and the ambition is to make difficult music easy, accessible, and fun.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Release.aspx?id=DACOCD790,01 Classical,Classical,Vocal,Denmark,2018 Danacord Records,2018 Danacord Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two further premiere recordings feature alongside the remarkable collaboration of Mundy, Sheppard and a young William Byrd on music for the Easter procession, In exitu Israel. Combining powerful music on a ceremonial scale with shorter liturgical works, this recording conveys the choir's sheer joy in their now firmly established role as ambassadors of sixteenth-century polyphony.

For a long time the composer searched for the ideal opera subject until he found it in Nathaniel Hawthorne's story 'The Wives of the Dead.' The template offers everything that the operatic heart desires: ""It requires almost no reduction, is ambiguous, irresistible, narrative broken and almost without an internal narrative,"" says the composer. First published anonymously in 1831 and then again in 1851, Hawthorne's 'The Wives of the Dead' is regarded as one of the most remarkable short stories in 19th century American literature. In the story, the wives of two brothers learn that both men have been killed abroad on consecutive days. In their grief, “sleep did not steal upon the sisters at one and the same time”; one woman slumbers while the other is awake. Far more than the tale of the grief of two widows, “The Wives of the Dead” deals with the “waking dreams such as Hawthorne explored again and again in fiction and in sketches like 'The Haunted Mind,' ” notes scholar Arlin Turner, and the ambiguity of the boundaries between the widows' dream-worlds and their realities leaves readers wondering how much of the story the two women experienced and how much they imagined.

Here, besides masterly compositional technique, there is life in every fiber, colors down to the finest nuance, meaning everywhere, the acutest expression of detail, and the whole cast over by a romanticism that we are already familiar with elsewhere among Schubert's works.” (Schumann) In this symphony, Enoch zu Guttenberg makes uncompromising statements about human existence, about the violent nature of our reality that is, all the same, pervaded by the most intimate beauty.

There is a baroque suite, but it plays elaborately with our expectations and listening habits, and there are ""transformations"" of individual movements of the two string sextets by Johannes Brahms: real ear-openers! Also, there are colorful variations on a theme and a virtuoso fantasy that unites the styles: brilliantly played, true expansions of the repertoire! “As if entirely of one mind” (Primephonic) captures the essence of every performance by the dynamic Menuhim Duo. Whether performing on two pianos or side by side at the same keyboard, Mookie and Jeremy play as one, interpreting the classical repertoire with devotion and joy.

Under the direction of Benjamin Bagby, Sequentia can look back on more than 40 years of international concert tours, a comprehensive discography of more than 30 recordings spanning the entire Middle Ages, film and television productions of medieval music drama, and a new generation of young performers trained in professional courses given by members of the ensemble. Sequentia was co-founded by Bagby and the late Barbara Thornton during their final years as students at the Schola Cantorum Basiliensis, and have maintained a solid link with the Swiss institution since then. Their appearance in the collection that the SCB publishes in co-production with Glossa was an eagerly expected one. And intriguing it is, too... Imprisoned in Pavia in the early 520s, Boethius could not have anticipated that his final work would become one of the most widely read books of the Middle Ages. The Consolation of Philosophy portrays his struggle to reconcile himself to his fate by exploring the ways of man, the role of Fortune, and the major questions of good and evil. Evidence that the poems of the Consolation were sung in the early Middle Ages survives in the form of musical notation added to over thirty extant manuscripts dating from the ninth through to the beginning of the twelfth century. Through scholarly detective work, the members of Sequentia, together with a Cambridge eminence in the medieval melodic tradition linked to Boethius' work, Sam Barrett, have been able to produce a convincing reconstruction of this lost repertory.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Release.aspx?id=GCD922518,01 Classical,Classical,,Austria,2018 Schola Cantorum Basiliensis,2018 Note 1 Music,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Horne; Bob Hoffnar; Joe McPhee; Sterling Steffen,1,CD,14.81,22.99,"What is the likelihood that hymns from the time of Pietism would resonate with progressive free musicians in Austin, Texas? Particularly when they are sung in a language that feels distant, even to Norwegians. On this album the miraculous happens, in that old texts communicate across centuries and language borders. The conversation makes room for new depths in text and tone. Pietism strongly promotes a life in faith and humble service. In Pietism, the letter of the teachings is less important than a personal and sincere faith in practical life. There is a powerful longing for heaven. The feeling of falling short as a human being, living in difficult circumstances with sickness, exhausting work, and poverty, resonated with the words of the hymns. Despite the distance and many differences between the two traditions, this sense of life can be likened to the situations of those who wrote spirituals and blues on the other side of the great ocean. A dialogue plays out between Gunvor Fagerhaug's singing and Andreas Bjørkås's fiddle playing on the one side – and Ingebrigt Håker Flaten's bass and the impressive lineup of Austin-based musicians from both hip-hop, free jazz, and electronica on the other.

Both provocative and mesmerizing, her agility on this underappreciated folk instrument is without equal. When interfaced with live electronic processing, furthermore, she surely reaches sonic territories where no one has gone before. Six electroacoustic composers, from Italy to Brazil, and her home base in New York, have collaborated with Lamneck on this journey. The tarogato is a single reed woodwind instrument with a hauntingly beautiful sound. It is originally a folk instrument from the regions of Hungary and Romania whose music has been handed down aurally; references to folk art and gypsy melodies are woven throughout this album. The instrument provides a rich sound, full of harmonics, and Lamneck has managed to extend the range by an octave. Because it does not have the extensive key mechanism of a clarinet or saxophone, there are many glissandos and otherwise impossible techniques available. Lamneck explains, “In this album, Tarogato Constructions, each composer has designed a musical world which reacts to what I play by triggering electronic sounds which then influence the direction of my improvisational composition. All of these musical environments have propelled me to use the extreme sonic possibilities of the tarogato.” The New York Times has called Esther Lamneck “an astonishing virtuoso.” She has an active career as a soloist and is the director of the Woodwind program at NYU.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Release.aspx?id=INN994,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Avant-Garde,,,2018 Esther Lamneck,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The recording of these compositions followed in November 2017 on four Steinway D pianos in the main hall of the historic Radiostudio Zürich. Composer, trombonist and scholar George E. Lewis, who knew Eastman personally and played with him, writes in the liner notes: “This brilliant recording by the Kukuruz Quartet constitutes an important new contribution to the growing corpus of performances of music by the composer, pianist, and singer Julius Eastman (1940-1990), who came to prominence in the experimental music scene of the 1970s and 1980s ... On this recording, the Kukuruz Quartet renders Eastman's spirit of adventure audible and sensuous, exemplifying a new, creolized formation of contemporary classical music that is able to embrace a multicultural, multi-ethnic usable past and thinkable future that can affirm our common humanity in the pursuit of new music.“",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Release.aspx?id=INT306,02 Jazz,Jazz,Jazz|Contemporary Jazz,Switzerland,2018 Intakt Records,2018 Intakt Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Yet the musicians who remain in Cuba—whose relationship with jazz and other musical forms stays grounded in their native island's cultural traditions and daily life—maintain a unique perspective. They tell a specific story. Un Día Cualquiera, pianist Harold López-Nussa's second release for Mack Avenue Records, represents this musical vantage point with force and innovation.

The August performance marked the band's final show together, saying goodbye to this configuration of Aimée's band while welcoming a new chapter of creative output. As anyone who has followed her work over the last decade can hear, Aimée thrives on living in the moment. Nowhere is that more evident than on stage; throughout Cyrille Aimée Live she holds the audience in the palm of her hand.

The concert captured here marks the end of an era, but the tone is celebratory, not bittersweet. Aimée's tight-knit band – guitarists Adrien Moignard and Michael Valeanu, bassist Dylan Shamat, and drummer Dani Danor – share as warm and playful an energy as ever. Aimée, restlessly creative and an inveterate improviser – in her life as in her music – is anxiously looking forward to new opportunities, new sounds, and even a new home.

Margaret Leng Tan has long been a champion of Crumb's music, and he composed Metamorphoses (Book 1) for her. This recording is of the German premiere at the legendary Donaueschingen Festival in 2017. Crumb's Metamorphoses is a natural descendent of his monumental Makrokosmos I & II piano cycle of the early 1970s. With a nod to Mussorgsky's Pictures at an Exhibition, each movement of the Metamorphoses is inspired by a famous painting. And, like the Makrokosmos, it requires the pianist to be a virtuoso not only at the keyboard but playing inside the piano and vocalizing as well. Ms. Tan is regarded at the “Diva of the Toy Piano,” and Crumb has also incorporated the toy piano and toy percussion instruments into some movements. Crumb says: “I have always been most fortunate to have had outstanding pianists who were willing to tackle the formidable technical and musical innovations in my scores. And among the very finest of these is Margaret Leng Tan for whom I wrote Metamorphoses (Book l). Margaret's technical prowess and superb artistic sensitivity is a combination that must warm the heart of any composer!” The album also includes the early Five Pieces for Piano. All the components of Crumb's mature compositional language are already evident: a broad palette of coloristic effects along with an extraordinarily sensitive command of nuance, his unmistakable musical gestures, an inherent sense of drama coupled with a magical suspenseful atmosphere and a battery of interior piano effects demanding that the pianist be somewhat of a harpist and percussionist as well.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Release.aspx?id=MOD-CD-303,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Avant-Garde,United States,2017 Sudwestrundfunk,2018 Mode Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The album is a collaboration with Javanese contemporary gamelan composer Gondrong Guanarto and his team of virtuoso gamelan players. Gamelan, for non-initiates, is the music of Bali and Java, played mostly on tuned gongs, which has long inspired smart western music makers from Debussy, Messaien, Philip Glass and Steve Reich to Sonic Youth. Traces of its shimmering, loopy DNA are over everything from modal jazz to electronic dance music.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Release.aspx?id=NJ628711,02 Jazz,Jazz,World,United Kingdom,2017 Susheela Raman,2017 Susheela Raman,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mary Kouyoumdjian's 'Byblos' is inspired by the ancient Lebanese city of the same name, and involves an accompanying electronic track that subtly deconstructs a Mediterranean traditional dance in hazy washes of sound. The guitar writing at times evokes the figurations of its regional cousin, the oud. With its title, Courtney Bryan's 'Soli Deo Gloria' signals its alignment with centuries of work dedicated to the glory of a higher being and purpose. The composition's journey is framed in terms of Bryan's relationship to the stages of prayer- Contemplative, Unsettled and Searching, Questioning and Hopin, a Prayer, Pursuing, Realization, Acceptance. Iranian composer Golfam Khayam's title work is in three movements, and one hears echoes of the oud and Middle Eastern music in fleet. Gity Razaz's work is more squarely within modern compositional tradition, and her 'Four Haikus' are four tightly crafted pieces. Gabriella Smith's 'Loop the Fractal Hold of Rain' engages with popular music more overtly than the other music on the recording. Duo Noire's playing throughout is virtuosic, sensitive, and calibrated beautifully to the style of each work.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Release.aspx?id=FCR210,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Contemporary Era,United States,2018 Duo Noire,2018 Duo Noire,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Over the course of his prolific career, the German composer proved that he could write for any instrument as well, and that very notion became something of a mission for him- to ensure that each instrument had its share of solo repertoire. Convergent Winds, a new recording from Oberlin Music, showcases five sonatas Hindemith wrote for woodwinds. It features performances by a host of esteemed Oberlin Conservatory faculty: clarinetist Richard Hawkins, pianist James Howsmon, flutist Alexa Still, oboist and English hornist Robert Walters, and retired bassoonist George Skakeeny. The works were written between 1936- a time when Hindemith's music was banned from performance in Nazi Germany- to 1942, by which time he has resettled in America. For Howsmon, a longtime professor of instrumental accompanying at Oberlin, the recording pays tribute to an exacting neoclassicist whose music has unfairly fallen out of fashion. “Rather than being a huge innovator, Hindemith took his inspiration from past eras, and yet he had a really wonderful approach to it,” Howsmon says. “He took old models and made them look new, and no matter how wild he gets, you can always find where his starting point was, and it was always 150 years before. He's like a master furniture builder- a total craftsman. There have been others who have done that, of course, but to me he is the best of them.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Release.aspx?id=OC18-02,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Brass & Woodwinds,United States,2018 Oberlin Music,2018 Oberlin Music,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There are several recordings by him of the 3rd to 5th and 7th to 9th Symphonies, two in the case of the Seventh, a live recording from the 1949 Salzburg Festival with the Vienna Philharmonic, and this transfer direct from the original tapes of 1963 (and not “off the air”) with the Cologne Radio Symphony Orchestra. The Seventh is particularly suited to comparison with older recordings insofar as there is no question of the alternative versions and editions we otherwise associate with Bruckner. The difference between the two recordings is substantial, which is no particular surprise when it comes to “Kna”. His later reading released here is painted on a broader canvas, goes into less individual detail; at the same time, one can appreciate how comprehensively Knappertsbusch plans the grand design while noting with amazement – especially at the brass-scored fortissimo climaxes typical of Bruckner – how energetically the conductor shapes, phrases, “turns into music” even here, something one does not hear these days. The orchestra is impressive for its exceptional solo contributions.

At first Mozart set to work with enthusiasm, and soon after, the first flute quartet was finished. But shortly after having penned the double bar at the end of his first quartet, he met the young soprano Aloysia Weber, with whom he fell in love. Very quickly, Dejean's commission became a millstone around his neck and it took him several years to fulfill it. Although the quartets in G, in C and in A do not have the breadth and, for some commentators, the quality of the quartet in D, they provide as a group a most comprehensive portrait of Mozart – the composer and the man. The charming 'galant' style of the quartets in G and in C recall Johann Christian Bach, one of Mozart's models; it is well and truly in these works that Mozart surprises by his elegant simplicity, which contrasts with the exuberance of the Quartet in D. Oxalys was founded in 1993 by a group of ambitious young students from the Brussels Conservatory of Music. Since then the ensemble has developed into one of the most esteemed professional chamber music groups in Flanders. The composition of this ensemble remains open to new musicians in order to complete an original string quintet, a flute player, a clarinet player and a harp player, which permits to interpret a broader repertoire and to realize uncommon projects.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Release.aspx?id=PAS1042,01 Classical,Classical,,Netherlands,,2017 Musurgia; Passacaille 1042,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sezione aurea is Italian for “Golden Mean,” which is defined as “the part of a line segment which represents the mean proportion between the entire segment and the remaining part.” The ensemble was created in 2013 following Luca Giardini's idea of reuniting some of the finest European baroque musicians active on the concert platform and on album.

Among the thousands of exhibits is a collection of carefully copied, framed and preserved harp music. It shows that, following the example of the Parisian salons, the harp was also a highly popular instrument in Poland. Two Poles contributed to the development of the harp: Prince Michal Kazimierz Oginski (1728-1800) - hetman, poet, composer and harpist, and his friend Karol Groll (1770-1852) - engraver, constructor, entrepreneur and distinguished scholar of Warsaw. They constructed the world's first harp with a double-action pedal system. Karol Groll patented this invention in London in 1807 and immediately following this he sold it to the French piano and harp builder, Sebastian Erard, who is still considered to be the father of the modern harp. The Czartoryski Library includes works for the pre-Erard harp and for the harp invented in the 19th century. This treasure, a collection of almost 200 titles hidden for over 100 years in Cracow, is an inexhaustible source of inspiration for concerts. The artists have chosen several works arranged in order from the simplest, anonymous composers to works by virtuoso harpists, such as J.B.Cardon, F.Pollini and John Thomas. The mazurka, entitled ""L'Esperance"" for solo harp, which John Thomas dedicated to Princess Anna Czartoryska in Paris, is a beautiful work related to Poland. It has shades of Chopin in it and the title ""Hope"" is an expression of the composer's sympathy for Polish efforts to regain independence.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Release.aspx?id=Phasma001,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Chamber Music,Poland,2017 Phasma-Music,2017 Phasma-Music,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The urgent, impulsive drama of the First, which propelled Brahms into international standing as a performer as well as a composer, was answered more than 20 years later by the more spaciously conceived Second, often more light-hearted in character yet making even more strenuous demands upon its performers as a fully symphonic concerto. Those demands are met here by the Italian pianist Vincenzo Maltempo (b.1985), whose recordings of Romantic piano music have won critical superlatives. Of his debut on the label with the notoriously exacting music of Alkan, PianoNews considered Maltempo to be “one of the greatest contemporary interpreters of this composer... no other pianist as Maltempo has managed to dominate in a so well thought-out and orchestral way the enormous difficulties.” According to Andrew Clements in The Guardian, the album is “Exhilarating, demonic, a real revelation.” Four further albums of Alkan's music followed for the label, as well as the Hungarian Rhapsodies by Liszt and the 12 Etudes d'exécution transcendante Op.11 of Lyapunov. As Maltempo's first concerto recording, this album is sure to be welcomed by not only his many followers but also all those listeners with their ear to the ground for modern virtuoso pianists. Here he is partnered by the Italian-based Mitteleuropa Orchestra under its principal conductor, Marco Guidarini, who is an experienced opera conductor across Europe and the US. This album presents the live registration of both the Brahms piano concertos, as played by Vincenzo Maltempo on two consecutive nights with the Mitteleuropa Orchestra, conducted by Marco Guidarini.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Release.aspx?id=PCL10145,01 Classical,Classical,,Germany,2018 Piano Classics,2018 Piano Classics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Made between 1936 and 1963, these recordings showcase not only one of the finest venues in the world, but one of the world's finest composers. Tchaikovsky wrote his first opera, The Voyevoda, in 1867. After a disastrous premiere, the self-critical composer burnt the entire manuscript of the work. Luckily, most of the score has been reconstructed from the individual parts. It is included in the first portion of this release for modern listeners to make up their own minds about the music. Luckily, his feelings about his first opera didn't stop him from pursuing more within the genre. As a composer of opera, Tchaikovsky could seek inspiration in centuries of operatic tradition in Western Europe, but the history of the opera in Russia had only just begun a few years before he was born. While Tchaikovsky welcomed the ideas of Western Europe, he faced rivalry from “The Mighty Handful” of nationalist Russian composers. Despite a rocky first few operas, Tchaikovsky went on to find later success as he walked a middle-road between operatic tradition and Russian nationalism. While his operas never found the success that his ballets did, this release proves that they are the works of a brilliant mind.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Release.aspx?id=PH17053,01 Classical,Classical,,Germany,,2018 Profil Medien,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Gieseking's playing lived from his accuracy and gift of observation, but also from being at home in various European cultures and possessing an awareness of widely differing musical forms, which was reflected in a very wide repertoire extending beyond the classics to composers then less well-known, such as Hindemith, Schoenberg, Busoni and Szymanowski. His piano technique revealed a hitherto unknown lightness. Gieseking translated feelings effortlessly into physical movement, resulting in a unique emotional immediacy of sound. The combination of precision and such unbridled devotion again proved its worth in Walter Gieseking's recording of Mozart's piano works, music which demands the highest technical ability alongside an essential lightness in its acoustic.

Since Maria Callas, these roles are sung with heavier and primarily dramatic voices. In our times this is considered common property. Nevertheless, one should always keep in mind, that these roles - in terms of requirements and stylistics – can´t be separated from the epoch of bel canto and, even in Verdi's time without any exception, sung by leading bel canto prima donnas or explicitly composed for this kind of voice. Elena Mosuc started her brilliant international career at the Zurich Opera House. Guest appearances have taken place at the most important houses and festivals in the world (including the opera houses of Amsterdam, Barcelona, Berlin, Hamburg, Teatro alla Scala Milan, Munich, Vienna, Salzburg, Paris, London, Helsinki, Rome, Venice, Verona ) as well as in the USA to the MET, and to Japan, China and Korea.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Release.aspx?id=SM279,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Opera,Austria,2018 Solo Musica,2018 Solo Musica,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Performed by Maria Marchant, Bantock Rediscovered is being issued to celebrate the 150th anniversary of Bantock's birth in 1868. This is a major release supported by a full-page advert in Gramophone magazine and is sure to attract considerable attention for its treasure-trove of music newly rescued from neglect and the new light it sheds on a revered composer. Composed between 1894 and 1938, these immensely varied, beautifully crafted works illustrate fascinating aspects of Bantock's artistry and music. The carefully chosen, exquisitely played programme reveals the breadth, delicacy and deliberateness of what Robert Matthew-Walker describes in his booklet notes as Bantock's “always clever structuring and drily eloquent style”. Among the gems to be discovered here are Memories of Sapphire, three beautiful lyrical tone poems recalling a visit to North Carolina and dedicated to the composer's mother; the richly impressionistic Barcarolle showing Bantock's piano writing at its finest; the late, lively Parade March and the striking piano transcription of the symphonic overture Saul, with its early hints of the orientalism that would later prove so significant to Bantock's music. Demonstrating Bantock's deft ability to borrow from traditional music, the Two Scottish Pieces offer up a vivacious quickstep and reel. Heard in their entirety, the Twelve Piano Pieces carry themselves with a 'light music' gloss but reveal deeper feelings and more sophisticated meaning in the hands of a master composer.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Release.aspx?id=SOMMCD 0183,01 Classical,Classical,,United Kingdom,2018 SOMM Recordings,2018 SOMM Recordings,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2018,SOM,SOMM Recordings,ARIADNE 5001,748871500129,Edvard Grieg,Carole Farley sings Grieg Songs,Carole Farley; London Philharmonic Orchestra; Philharmonia Orchestra,1,CD,14.81,22.99,"Somm Recordings launches its new re-issues and historical label, Ariadne, with a spell-binding collection of songs by Edvard Grieg performed by the legendary husband-and-wife team of soprano Carole Farley and José Serebrier conducting the London Philharmonic and Philharmonia orchestras. Released by Dinemec Classics in 1998, 'Carole Farley sings Grieg Songs' follows Somm's acclaimed recording of Grieg's Piano Concerto and Piano Concerto No. 2 by Mark Bebbington. Sensational American soprano Carole Farley brings enormous passion and exquisite poetry to intensely personal songs originally composed for piano accompaniment but here richly orchestrated by José Serebrier. Sung in Norwegian, the sublime result showcases Grieg at his most evocative, Farley at her most expressive and Serebrier at his most nuanced. Grieg orchestrated only a handful of his 180 songs although they lend themselves readily to the broader palette of a symphony orchestra. José Serebrier says: “My choice of songs for orchestration was dictated primarily by the character of the writing. In most cases, the orchestration seemed so obvious, it almost literally jumped out of the page. I took great care to orchestrate them idiomatically”. Carole Farley says: “The idea for this recording was to make these under-performed songs available to a wider public. The poetry is so very evocative and the marriage of the words and the music makes these songs absolutely unique”. Carole Farley shot to fame as Alban Berg's Lulu at the Metropolitan Opera in 1977. Now a respected vocal coach, she continues to perform around the world, most recently touring Poulenc's La Voix Humaine in the United States and Europe. One of the most recorded classical artists in history, conductor-composer José Serebrier has received 46 Grammy nominations and won the Latin Grammy Award for his own Carmen Symphony in 2004.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Release.aspx?id=ARIADNE 5001,01 Classical,Classical,,United Kingdom,2018 SOMM Recordings,2018 SOMM Recordings,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We met during our first year as doctoral students at Arizona State University, developing a natural collaborative energy when Hannah began writing her dissertation on Antheil's three Parisian violin sonatas. Over the course of six months, we discovered the very limits of our technical and musical skill as we worked through each piece. We thrived on the raw energy and driving aggression of Antheil's early sonatas, finding beauty in their vivacity and quirky athleticism. In the fall of 2016, we received an email... informing us of a newly discovered Antheil work for violin and piano, found amongst the late violinist Werner Gebauer's papers. Marc Gebauer, his son, had unearthed a set of three short waltzes, Valses from “Specter of the Rose,” an arrangement of music from Antheil's 1947 film score for Specter of the Rose. As we studied Gebauer's Valses, we learned that Antheil and Gebauer's relationship extended far beyond successful musical collaboration into friendship, mirroring our own musical relationship. Over the course of their collaboration, Antheil composed two works specifically for Gebauer, his 1945 Sonatina for Violin and Piano and his 1946 Violin Concerto... In the ink of the handwritten manuscript at the Library of Congress, we could see Antheil's borrowed melodies and ideas from earlier works pop out of the page, transformed for Gebauer's technical brilliance... In our recording we have attempted to remain as close to the handwritten score as possible... With these three pieces, we have come to a deeper understanding of the collaboration and friendship between two incredible musicians...”",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Release.aspx?id=DSL-92222,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Chamber Music,United States,2018 Sono Luminus,2018 Sono Luminus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Noting that “it is hard to find the right words to describe the beauty” of Mr. Varga's playing, Corriere della Sera's chief critic Paolo Isotta praised the young artist as a “true poet of the keyboard, a musician of depth, and a genuine artist.” Other critics have found his performances “impressive” (Gramophone, 2016), “magical” (Süddeutsche Zeitung, 2009), “colorful, vivacious [and] engaging” (Le Diapason, 2012). Discovered at age 10 by soprano Mariana Nicolesco, he went on to win top prizes at the George Enescu International Piano Competition and the International Maria Canals Piano Competition.

Three works have a sociopolitical slant, and several compositions draw on the energy that rock offers. The pieces are inspired by a wide variety of subjects, including: the Vietnam War; the infamous Attica Prison riots; the development of a “groovy” bass line; and the antics of catnip-fueled cats. Five of the six works receive their premiere recordings, and the sixth work presents a contemporary music masterpiece in a new, unusual arrangement. NakedEye's founder Ju-Ping Song comments, “Because members of the group come from diverse stylistic backgrounds, our music reflects the rock, jazz, experimental, and classical genres that define each musician separately. For us and for composers writing for us, this is a journey where storylines cross from the personal into the musical.” “This young ensemble has shown a wonderful commitment to commissioning and championing new music, so I'm not surprised they're releasing this ambitious, impressive album.” (Lainie Fefferman)",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Release.aspx?id=ST-228,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Avant-Garde,United States,2018 Starkland,2018 Starkland,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Those who reviewed the album especially appreciated his rare ability to combine thorough understanding both of the musical architecture and the deep emotionality of the works (a quality possessed also by the pianist's tutors Ivan Moravec and Alfred Brendel). From the early “Haydn-like” Sonata No. 3 in C major to the highly dramatic “Appassionata” to the transcendent last Sonata No. 32 in C minor, which gives an impression of the composer parting with this world, the pianist facilitates to us the amazing integrity and colorfulness of Beethoven's piano work. During the thirty years separating his first and last piano opus, the composer tried out numberless experiments, and yet some crucial themes come up again and again; the imprint of his unique musical DNA is discernible from his very first opuses. In the hands of Jan Bartoš, Beethoven whispers, sings and thunders.

His compositional output encompasses influences and musical fashions from many European counties, melting them into the so-called mixed style, the goût réuni. This mix of styles is an especially prominent feature in his XII Fantasie per il Flauto senza Basso (c. 1733, Hamburg). These Fantasias for an unaccompanied flute juxtapose German counterpoint with Italian virtuosity, French and English dance movements with Polish folk infused dances. Perhaps this is what Telemann's choice of title, 'Fantasie', refers to: a fanciful, imaginative, daring, and fantastic line-up of musical languages. This invites the idea of exploring the continuing relevance of these ingenious pieces by adding the 21st century to the mosaic of compositional styles. On the occasion of Telemann's 250th anniversary of death in 2017 the City Music Foundation and Tabea Debus have commissioned twelve contemporary pieces based on each of the Fantasias. All of these freshly-penned pieces are reflections on thematic, harmonic or rhythmic material taken from the Fantasias, a (re-) interpretation of musical ideas, a reply to Telemann's musical thoughts. This recording aims not only at documenting the ever expanding repertoire for solo recorder, but also at showcasing so-far “unheard of” ways of listening to seemingly 'old” music. It strives to reveal the continuous relevance of Telemann's music in general and his twelve Fantasias for solo flute in particular.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Release.aspx?id=TXA18105,01 Classical,Classical,,Germany,2018 TYXart,2018 TYXart,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

His music is always based on musical intuition, thus not permitting any clear delineation. Rather than filling rigid formal structures with musical material, Groslot uses a bottom-up method: based on a certain key idea (a melodic or rhythmic motif, a mood or a color) his music develops, as it were, in a natural and spontaneous manner. This album contains a number of works for chamber music, in which the flute in particular is given a prominent position: thus, the composer explores the possibilities of an instrument that has all too often been treated as a poor relation. Indeed, the relatively limited known repertoire for the flute is contrasted starkly by the almost endless technical possibilities and unsurpassed agility of this precious silver instrument. Groslot brings the instrument back into the spotlight in a sonorous adventure that wanders through many paths without losing the way.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Release.aspx?id=TXA18113,01 Classical,Classical,,Germany,2018 TYXart,2018 TYXart,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
