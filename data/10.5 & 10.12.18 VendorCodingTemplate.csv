The names of Arcangelo Corelli, Alessandro Scarlatti and the young G. F. Handel stand out among many others. Giovanni Lorenzo Lulier (Rome, c.1660-1700), a cellist and composer known as ‘Giovanni del Violone’, participated in this intensive musical activity. When he entered the entourage of Cardinal Pietro Ottoboni, in 1690, Lulier already had a decade of compositional activity behind him in the genres of oratorio, opera and above all the chamber cantata. Originally consisting of a succession of strophic arias, the cantata gradually established itself as a poetic and musical genre characterized by alternating recitatives and arias. As is well known, the conversazioni of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries also included the performance of instrumental music. On this release, Lulier’s cantatas are coupled with his sonatas and beautifully performed by Francesca Boncompagni, Accademia Ottoboni, and Marco Ceccato.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=ALPHA406&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Baroque Era,,Austria,2017 ACCADEMIA OTTOBONI & ALPHA CLASSICS / OUTHERE MUSIC France,2018 ALPHA CLASSICS / OUHERE MUSIC France,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This time, they venture into England with an essentially secular programme devoted to Henry Purcell (1659-95), varying the mood by alternating between instrumental dances and songs performed by the English countertenor Tim Mead, including ‘O Solitude’ and ‘What power art thou’. While Les Musiciens de Saint-Julien have chosen these celebrated pieces for pleasure above all, with this English programme they also fill in a new piece in their jigsaw map of the United Kingdom. At the same time, they demonstrate the musical porosity of Ireland, Scotland and England – and the atypical colors of the small string ensemble complemented by two flutes, a harp and harpsichord/lute continuo further underline the fact. The common thread, dear to Les Musiciens de Saint-Julien, is that of folk music lying at the heart of art music, in a mixture of origins, practices and repertories. We can easily recognize ‘Scotch and Irish tunes’ that Purcell incorporates in his overtures, jigs, hornpipes and chaconnes.

The themes and melodies are borrowed from Spanish, Turkish, Russian, Italian, English, Hungarian and French composers, inspired by folk music and dances. Édouard Ferlet has used this music to compose new pieces, arranged for harpsichord and piano. There are no direct quotations here, rather a thread which is woven between these well-known melodies and a new musical vocabulary. In each piece Violaine Cochard and Edouard Ferlet improvise freely, each with their individual ‘temperament’ and sensibility. They work on sonority, texture, the exploration of sound palettes, specialization, phrasing, distillation. The two artists seek to develop sonic possibilities, articulations, playing techniques and interaction between their musical personalities. A special feature is their work on pulse and tempo, with compound meters linked with the rhythms of folksongs and dances, which are often in compound time.

And it provided a perfect opportunity for an idea that we had been discussing for some time- an entire album arranged for vocals and strings. It also gave us a perfect opportunity to join forces with Sara and David, whom we met through the Mark O’Conner Strings Camps; Amos; and Alex from the Hausmann Quartet. We wanted the repertoire to present a sense of how Khanike was and is celebrated by different cultures around the world. The Ladino songs were traditionally sung by women in the kitchen as they prepared for the holiday. There is a particular feeling of intimacy, comfort and family that was true of how we musicians felt about each other, both musically and personally, and that is really satisfying. When you listen to these songs, you’ll hear the musicians thinking out loud and sharing inspiring thoughts and ideas with each other. Each of us has our own personal references, ranging from classical to jazz and blues, to Middle Eastern, klezmer, bluegrass, and Texas Swing.

The work's originality lies in the art of balancing the detail of chamber music with orchestral ""al fresco."" The concerto can be discovered alongside the skillfully-written Kakadu Variations, op. 121a, with their folk-like character, a work probably composed in 1809. The Piano Trio WoO 38 was composed in 1790/91 and is thus dating from Beethoven's Bonn period - an early stage of his chamber music compositions. During his lifetime the work remained unpublished. The Swiss Piano Trio concludes its journey through the cosmos of Beethoven's piano trio works with his ""final word"" in the genre, the Allegretto, WoO 39 dating from 1812.

At the end of his symphonies we often encounter utopias, as here in the Adagio of the Third, and many years later, particularly, in the Ninth. Something new sets in, but the movement is still a closure. From it we learn that whatever is new will no longer occur in this world. The Third Symphony, on the whole, is one of Mahler’s richest: the individual movements are so different from one another that they almost seem to stem from different periods of Mahler’s life. The Third contains its own world in itself- already in the first movement, longer than most Beethoven symphonies. Then Mahler plunges into the Wunderhorn world: the world of simplicity where his style seems inspired by Schubert. He quotes from his own works and creates his own mythology. Just as in a grand novel, the same figures appear in different stories. The second and third movements belong together; then, a new dimension is introduced in the fourth one with the human voice. With the contralto’s first note, Mahler truly opens up a new world. This is a new kind of composition altogether. The measures almost seem to flow into one another; Mahler is freeing himself from the rigors of rhythmic bars… This abandonment of the rigorous diktat of meter represents a challenge for every conductor.”",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=AVI%208553399&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,,Germany,2018 Avi-Service for music,2017 Deutschlandradio / Avi-Service for music,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Everything acquires existential significance. This is where our performers find a bridge that connects Juon’s kaleidoscopic tone poem with Pjotr Tchaikovsky’s colossal Piano Trio, op. 50, a musical epitaph for pianist and conductor Nikolai Rubinstein, who had been Tchaikovsky’s friend and mentor. Rubenstein had ensured that the young Tchaikovsky was allowed to enter the newly founded Moscow Conservatory while taking him up as a resident in his own home. “He looked after my every need like a child’s nurse,” Tchaikovsky wrote. Rubinstein not only made sure that Tchaikovsky wore appropriately elegant clothing, but he took him to the opera and to concerts while introducing him to his circle of colleagues and friends, playing out his connections to draw their attention to his protégé’s compositions. His unexpected passing in 1881 must have profoundly shattered the young Tchaikovsky, who dedicated the only piano trio he ever wrote to his late friend, adding the subtitle ‘A la memoire d’un grand artiste.’ The work consists of two monumental, thematically related movements. Beginning with a heartfelt cello cantilena, the first one is an extensive elegy or Pezzo elegiac: an immense variety of musical ideas flow together in this sonata form with exposition, development, and reprise. The second movement consists in a seemingly endless set of variations.

And to what extent are composers, when they compose, aware of how urgent that question is? In my opinion, these are the main themes that confront us in a “swan song” (a composer’s last work- or, as in the case of our recording, the last opus in his vocal output). In the second part of Schwanengesang- in the songs based on poems by Heine- Schubert attains an unprecedented economy- or rather concentration- of means: the demands thereby made on the performer are literally “unheard of.” The text and the music express themselves so directly that the listener can find no refuge in musical solace. Brahms’s Vier ernste Gesange, written in 1896, one year prior to his death, paint an entirely different picture. I find that they reveal his inner struggle for personal truthfulness, his hope to attain an all-subliming love after so many years of painstaking sacrifice, while somehow managing to retain a certain kind of faith…Samuel Barber’s last vocal work, the Three Songs Op. 45, has fascinated me ever since my student years, because of the songs’ multi-faceted style, their refined text and the music’s melancholy, morbid beauty. The second song, A Green Lowland of Pianos… elegantly whisks us off into an entirely different universe… As ambiguous as life itself, and undoubtedly as scintillating and multi-facetted as Leonard Bernstein’s own personality: that is how his swan song, Arias and Barcarolles, presents itself. This musical potpourri of daily-life situations acted out by singers makes an explosive Broadway entrance in the first song.”",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=AVI%208553402&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,,Germany,2017 Bayerischer Rundfunk / Avi-Service for music,2018 Bayerischer Rundfunk / Avi-Service for music,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Kuhn,Chiharu Naruse ,1,CD,11.69,17.99,"Composer and pianist Kenneth Kuhn, after finding the music he wanted to hear did not exist, strove to bring his own musical visions to life. The result, Piano Works of Kenneth Kuhn, is a cathartic journey through the memories and imagination of the composer. Romantic in quality, thematic, memorable, and deeply moving, Kuhn’s latest work leaves listeners feeling enriched and enchanted. Kuhn’s compositions arose from three main sources: dreams, memories, and spontaneity. In Prelude No. 3 in G-minor, the composer describes the free-flowing second section as having formed on its own, stating “As if controlled by some external something I literally watched my hands play this without any thought in the process.” ‘An Alpine Song’ formed from a dream of a young Bavarian woman singing and playing guitar in the Alps and what the composer could recall of her exotic melodies upon waking. In ‘Ode to Memories,’ the composer reminisces on his own past and its ups and downs, from joyous school years to the sudden death of a dear friend. Sublime in nature and simultaneously tender and haunting, each memorable composition tells its own story. Piano Works of Kenneth Kuhn bares the heart, mind, and soul of the composer in a beautiful, sentimental fashion. With its emotional height and depth, nature-inspired melodies, and connection to the sublime, Kuhn’s collection both moves and inspires listeners.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkMOq8_f1Vk&feature=youtu.be,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=BR8954&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Piano,,,,2018 Big Round Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When Fagerlund received a commission for a second opera from the Finnish National Opera, he found his inspiration closer to our own time as well as to his own field. Ingmar Bergman’s 1978 chamber drama Höstsonaten (Autumn Sonata) tells of the celebrated pianist Charlotte Andergast, and how she is confronted by her daughter Eva, who accuses her of neglect and self-absorption. Bergman’s screenplay has been used as basis for numerous stage productions, but this is the first adaptation for opera. Höstsonaten was premièred at the Finnish National Opera in Helsinki in 2017, with Anne Sofie von Otter as Charlotte – the role for which Ingrid Bergman was nominated to an Oscar as best actress.

The trio sonata was the primary vehicle for chamber music in the seventeenth and at least half of the eighteenth centuries. Its history mirrors other developments throughout the whole of the baroque era. This set is chiefly concerned with those for two violins and continuo, with occasional digressions into those for violin, bass viol and continuo, and one with viola replacing the second violin. Like the string quartet in later ages, most composers (with some notable and regrettable exceptions) tried their hand in the form. The customary addition of a figured bass part played on a harpsichord or organ around 1600 meant that middle parts of the old contrapuntal style could be excluded and chamber music soon began to favor the trio sonata texture. 150 years later, with the string quartet, the process was reversed as the viola took over the middle ground previously occupied by the keyboard.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=BIS-9050&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Baroque Era,,EU,2003-2013 BIS Records ,BIS Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

His oeuvre includes nearly three dozen operettas and light operas as well as countless farces and comedies, which he loosened up by framing them with musical numbers. This was the typical repertoire of Old Viennese folk theatre, which he imaginatively enriched in his various capacities as Kapellmeister at the Theater in der Josefstadt and as ""chief composer and conductor"" at the Theater an der Wien, as well as on other stages of the Austrian capital later on. His most famous operettas are ""The Beautiful Galatea"" (1865), ""Fatinitza"" (1876) and ""Boccaccio"" (1879). Although most of his stage works have now been forgotten, his sparkling, animated, captivating and thrilling overtures are supremely vivacious, conveying this composer’s skill, his imagination in inventing catchy melodies, and also his creative abilities where design or instrumentation are concerned. Overtures such as ""Light Cavalry"", ""Poet and Peasant"" or ""Morning, Noon and Night in Vienna"" were indispensable parts of Viennese operetta’s “golden age” and have remained a regular feature of the city’s musical life (e.g. the Vienna New Year's Concerts) to this day. As Chief Conductor of the Münchner Rundfunkorchester, Ivan Repušic has selected some of Suppé’s best-known and most popular overtures for his new studio production.

This is why they were tailored closely to clients’ wishes or to Bach’s own ideas. Taken together - and in contrast to ""modern"" cantatas - they are conservative in style, and belong to the tradition of vocal polyphony that reached its peak in the 16th century. The choir is backed not by an orchestra but only a simple instrumental accompaniment with basso continuo. To compensate for the missing orchestra, the vocal score is even more complex and finely detailed than usual: the small space is occupied by all kinds of compositional techniques, contrapuntal and concertante, as well as with chorales and double choirs. With exceptionally reduced means, Bach thus created music that was every bit as significant and expressive as that of his much larger works. These motets were the first works to introduce the Bach “Renaissance”, even before the revival of the St Matthew Passion in 1829, and they evince an unbroken performance tradition to this today - also because they were not only composed for church services but for early forms of popular festivities. To this day, for any choir, Bach's motets represent a special artistic and interpretive challenge. On this BR-KLASSIK album, the Chor des Bayerischen Rundfunks, under its artistic director Howard Arman, sings a selection of Bach’s most well-known motets.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=BRK900523&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Choral,,Germany,BRmedia Service GmbH,BRmedia Service GmbH,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Why have you suffered? Is everything just one enormous, terrible joke? We have to solve these questions in some way if we want to carry on living,"" said the composer. Similar questions preoccupied him throughout his life, and with a special intensity during his time as an opera conductor in Hamburg. The Second Symphony, also referred to as the ""Resurrection Symphony"", is a complete expression of Mahler’s existential struggle; both its form and its overpowering sound make this utterly clear. The symphony took several years to compose – it was written between 1888 and 1894. In September 1888, the first movement – which at this point still bore the title ""Totenfeier” (“Funeral Rite”) – was already complete. The second and third movements were not written until 1893 and Mahler only completed the entire work in 1894. Like most of Mahler’s symphonies, the work follows a ""Per aspera ad astra"" pattern (“through difficulties to the stars”). Starting with a funeral march in the main theme of the opening movement - the passing of a life full of vigor, pain, blows of fate, and only a few brief and beautiful moments - the symphony concludes with a triumphant resurrection movement. The premiere of the complete symphony took place on December 13, 1895 in Berlin under Mahler's direction; previously (on March 4 of that year) he had already performed the first three movements. The premiere of the Second Symphony thus took place after that of the Third. The reactions were initially subdued, but today the work ranks as one of the most popular of Mahler’s symphonies.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=BRK900167&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Romantic Era,,Germany,BRmedia Service GmbH,BRmedia Service GmbH,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Though his keyboard sonatas have appeared on several recorded collections of the Italian Baroque, they have rarely been presented in a comprehensive manner. In doing so, this album celebrates the personal even idiosyncratic style of a composer whose technical accomplishment facilitates rather than stifling his creative voice. The 12 Sonatas were later published as Op.3. They date from early in Marcello’s career, and are mostly cast in three and four brief movements, though the first and last of them, in D minor and C minor respectively, feature more extended forms. The minor-key sonatas are generally more dramatic and varied in mood; two complementary performances of the G minor Sonata afford the opportunity to compare the tone-colours of the different instruments used on the recording. There are several sonatas not belonging to the Op.3 collection which are less often heard, and their inclusion here is valuable, alongside Marcello’s magnificent chaconne, subtitled ‘La stravaganza’: a 15-minute tour-de-force of keyboard invention. The album is enhanced by a vivid account of Marcello’s music, life and career, written by the harpsichordist Laura Farabollini. On this recording she plays a modern Italian copy of a late-18th century French instrument by Taskin, with two manuals and four registers.

In it, a maid and a servant conspire to convince their master to marry the maid. When Aldo Tarabella was asked to direct a performance of Pergolesi’s intermezzo, he wanted to do more than simply pair it with one of the operas it traditionally sits alongside – so he composed Il Servo Padrone, a companion piece, and a kind of sequel, to Pergolesi’s original. At the level of the plot, things come full circle, and by the end, master and servants have returned to where things began, highlighting the difficulty of fundamentally changing social conditions. A kind of emancipation seemed within reach, but is ultimately not achieved – in some senses, the reverse of what one might expect given the transformation of social roles in Europe among (at least middle-class) women in the 17th century and since. Musically, however, this homage to an 18th-century musical form is very much brought into the present day. Its arias are developed in an atonal context and its recitatives leave traditional Classical form behind to travel symbolically towards the light-hearted episodes found in 20th-century musical comedy.

A bold claim, but one made with passion by the guitarist Izhar Elias in his own booklet essay for this ground-breaking new album. Born in the Italian city of Pavia around 1615, Corbetta worked as a musician in the court of Madrid but he made his career and lasting reputation in France. According to contemporary accounts, Corbetta’s playing epitomized the ornate Baroque guitar solo. The high range, frequent resolution of dissonance, virtuosic techniques, and coloristic effects, such as overlapping tones of campanelas or flashy repicco strumming, converged in his guitar music to make it the most brilliant if challenging of the era. On this album Elias has made his own selection from two of Corbetta’s published volumes which were written for King Charles II (1671) and King Louis XIV (1674) respectively. According to him, Corbetta’s music is rooted in the popular songs and dances of his day, making him more like a modern pop songwriter. Using the genres of chaconne and passacaglia, several of which are included here, he transformed the guitar into a polyphonic instrument and a genuinely soloistic one compared to its previous, humble role as an accompaniment to song and strings. There are also two substantial dance suites, in A minor and G minor. The Dutch-born guitarist Izhar Elias has made several significant contributions to the extensive library of guitar music on Brilliant Classics, including a Spanish Baroque album, ‘La Monarcha’, an exploration of Beethoven’s little-known writing for the instrument; and perhaps most noteworthy, a first complete recording for substantial excerpts from Rossini’s late masterpiece Semiramide, arranged for solo guitar by Giuliani. ‘You’ll rarely hear anyone work so hard,’ remarked the Classics Today reviewer. ‘The playing is magnificent – fluent, tonally as varied as possible, rhythmically true to Rossini.’",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=BRI95587&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,,Germany,2018 Brilliant Classics,2018 Brilliant Classics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bach, in 1709. Bach had by then taken up a post in Weimar, but the two men became friends, and Telemann dedicated to him a Concerto in D major (TWV 51:D6), of which the slow movement opens with a festive BACH motif, in a transposed version. This is one of three first recordings on the album. The other concertos and sonatas in this recording were also composed during Telemann’s time in Eisenach. A pair of quartets, in D minor (TWV 43:d2) and G major (TWV 43:G12), follow the same principle in the treatment of the parts, whereby in the slow opening movements the instruments take turns – in TWV 43:d2 the viola, in TWV 43:G12 the flute – and the other parts accompany. The Sonatas IV in C major (TWV 43:C1) and F major (TWV 43:F1) were originally composed for two violins, viola and basso continuo, later adapted by a Parisian publisher to include an upper part for a wind instrument. Further value to any Baroque-music enthusiast is added by the inclusion of two sonatas and a concertino written by Johann Melchior Molter, who is now known almost exclusively through the compositions he wrote for his own instrument, the trumpet. By contrast, these works present a less extrovert side to the composer, who belonged to the generation after Telemann (though in fact died two years before him, in 1765) and worked in Eisenach after the elder composer’s departure. The two quartets date from a later period of Molter’s career, when he was based in Karlsruhe: fully mature, richly worked chamber sonatas in a highly ornamented Italian idiom. The cheerful, vivacious Concertino is essentially a duet for violin and harpsichord. With this album, the Leipzig-based Camerata Bachiensis make their debut on Brilliant Classics. Founded in 2012, they are now ensemble in residence at the city’s Bach Museum, and they make frequent appearances at the major early-music festivals in central Europe.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=BRI95621&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,,Germany,2018 Brilliant Classics,2018 Brilliant Classics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Working day to day with imperishable masterworks by Bach, Beethoven and Brahms, they did not expect to meet such standards, yet their own creative voices required an outlet through more than recreation of others. Left cold by the musical innovations and developments of their own time in the work of Schoenberg and Stravinsky, they wrote in a heightened Romantic idiom, and in genres – especially song and chamber music – which lay separately from their own professional activity as performers. Both chamber works presented here date from Kempff’s youth. The Piano Trio was composed in 1911, when Kempff was 16, and bears a clear Brahmsian influence in thematic conduct and emotional landscape, through the guidance of Kempff’s teacher Robert Kahn, who had himself been a student of Brahms. The Quartet is scored for the more unusual combination of flute, violin, cello and piano. It dates from 1920, and was composed on the island of Capri during a period of recuperation from a serious illness which had laid him low during a concert tour of Sweden. Thus the second movement is based on a Swedish folk theme and the finale ends with a whirlin Tarantella di Taormina, in the tradition exemplified by Mendelssohn’s ‘Italian’ Symphony of German musicians letting Italian sunshine into their work. The Quartet is led by the flautist Ginevra Petrucci. Now based in the US, Petrucci has made several well-received recordings for Brilliant Classics, among them Romantic-era concertos by Briccialdi and a ‘winning’ (MusicWeb International) album of chamber music by the Polish-US immigrant Robert Muczynski.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=BRI95629&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,,Germany,2018 Brilliant Classics,2018 Brilliant Classics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Now the focus falls on his chamber music, with these new studio recordings of suites, sonatas, tone-poems and fantasies. From the piquant miniatures of the two Signorine Op.10 to the neoclassically economical Suite 508 Op.170, all the works here abound in the bitter-sweet harmonies and soaring melodic rapture which gave a distinctive flavour to Castelnuovo-Tedesco’s music throughout his long career. Song without words is another thread to his output, first encountered here in the Tre canti all’aria aperta from 1919. Tuscan folksong and medieval troubadour tradition are spiced with Bartokian harmony in a fresh and appealing combination. The writing for the string instruments is reliably extrovert and idiomatic, influenced by the music’s dedicatees and first performers such as Jascha Heifetz, Albert Spalding and Adila Fachiri, grandniece of Joseph Joachim. Notturno Adriatico is a tranquil, dream-like tone-picture with a tenuous hold on the repertoire, like the virtuoso flourish of Exotica: A Rhapsody of the South Seas. However, the extensive fantasy on themes from Donizetti’s La fille du regiment is a substantial rarity which deserves much wider currency. In the same tradition of the operatic fantasy is a paraphrase of Rossini’s ‘Largo al factotum’; like the two deft miniatures from a series of Greetings Cards Op.170, the paraphrase was issued in print, whereas most of the five-movement Donizetti fantasy remains unpublished. So does the Suite 508 for viola and piano, composed in 1960. With typical ingenuity, Castelnuovo-Tedesco works in the name of the different dedicatees to each of the seven movements, resulting in chromaticism on the verge of atonality at times, but reliably handled with verve and melodic prominence.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=BRI95642&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,,Germany,2018 Brilliant Classics,2018 Brilliant Classics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This new album forms a significant appendix to that monument of gramophone history. Liszt’s pioneering series of 12 symphonic poems came to fruition during his time as Kapellmeister at the court of the Duke of Weimar in the 1850s, although the gestation of many of the pieces begins somewhat earlier. Liszt did not conceive the final order of the works until all the pieces were ready for publication, but it is clear that he thought of all 12 works as a gigantic cycle. He issued them in versions for orchestra, for two pianos, and for piano duet. Thus, although works such as Les Préludes are familiar in their orchestral guise, they were conceived from the outset no less for the keyboard. The two-piano versions of these pieces are no mere transcriptions: Liszt allows quite considerable variance from the orchestral scores in order to make real duos, occasionally even adding some bars (as in Hungaria), omitting bars – especially of untuned percussion, or transforming the material with new harmonies instead of untuned percussion. As with his monumental versions of the Beethoven symphonies, he often makes an informed trade of the letter of the score for the spirit of it, and happily gets all the closer to the musical substance.

2018,Brilliant Classics,BRI95762,5028421957623,Joseph Marie Clement Dall'Abaco ,Dall'Abaco: Capricci a Violoncello Solo,Francesco Galligioni,1,CD,7.79,11.99,"Born in Brussels in 1710, Joseph Marie Clément Ferdinand Dall'Abaco displayed such an aptitude for the cello that at the age of 19, he was appointed cellist in the chapel orchestra of the Prince Elector Clemens August I of Bavaria in Bonn. In due course he became Kammermusikdirektor to the Prince Elector of Cologne before a scandal necessitated a hasty move to Verona in 1753. However, Dall’Abaco retained his allegiances to previous German employers, and dedicated this set of Capricci to the Elector of Bavaria. The Capricci are no mere exercises, devised for cellists by a cellist, even though the wider public is barely aware of them. Eleven such works survive on the only extant copy of the manuscript, though Dall’Abaco probably wrote twelve. They probably date from the 1770s, though the composer lived on until 1805. Their style is a relative of the Empfindsamer Stil pioneered by Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach, and in many ways they are the immediate successor to the Cello Suites of JS Bach. A vein of melancholy pervades many of the pieces, especially those in the minor key. There are also allusions to 17th and 18th century dances: for instance, the second and the sixth Capriccio, which borrow respectively from the allemande and the courante. The eighth, in G minor, stands out on account of its length and its complex polyphony, which is also a feature of the seventh Capriccio. Others develop around simple chords, or in the toccata style, as in the case of the ninth. Another common element is the allusion to the perpetuum mobile by means of the reiteration of a particular rhythm or figuration. Thus the Capricci make serious demands upon any cellist, hardly less than do the Caprices of Paganini for the violin. Taking up the challenge here is Francesco Galligioni, who was praised by MusicWeb International for his ‘measured and thoughtful’ approach to the cello sonatas of Vivaldi.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=BRI95762&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,,Germany,2018 Brilliant Classics,2018 Brilliant Classics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Of course, nobody was more aware of these evolutions than clarinettists themselves, who are represented here by two instrumentalist–composers, the Swedish-Finnish Bernhard Crusell, whose three concertos make use of the clarinet’s full range, and Heinrich Baermann, the dedicatee of Weber’s works blessed with a wonderful personal idiom. Other names which may be less familiar to listeners include Charles Villiers Stanford, a leading figure in the late-19th-century renaissance of British music who is often overshadowed by Elgar and Vaughan Williams, and Julius Rietz, most closely associated with Mendelssohn, both of whom contribute concertos with clear influences (Brahms and Mendelssohn respectively) that still retain their individuality. Mendelssohn himself is not often associated with the clarinet, but features here via his Concert Pieces for clarinet, basset horn and piano, alongside other unexpected figures such as Rossini and Mercadante (both better known for their operas) and Franz Anton Hoffmeister, most famous as a music publisher. The other multiple-soloist compositions come from the pen of Carl Stamitz, a prolific composer who contributed more than ten concertos featuring the clarinet. Equally prolific was Franz Krommer, whose concertos are among the most unpredictable and imaginative in the set. Also notable for its innovative style is Copland’s concerto, influenced by jazz and written in response to a commission from famous jazz clarinettist Goodman. By contrast, Bruch, despite living through the diverse innovations of the late 18th and early 19th century, remained steadfast and consistent in his compositional approach.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=BRI95787&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,,Germany,2018 Brilliant Classics,2018 Brilliant Classics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Still hardly present is the music by the German Romantic composer Emilie Mayer. At the age of five, she began receiving piano lessons, and in the early 1840s none other than Carl Loewe in Stettin was her teacher.

The show has been performed nine times since 2016, and has been met with great enthusiasm.

World-premiere recordings include Noel Da Costa’s ‘A Set of Dance Tunes for Solo Violin,’ based on American fiddle tunes; Daniel Bernhard Roumain’s ‘Filter,’ which conjures the sounds of electronic dance music and psychedelic guitar; Errollyn Wallen’s ‘Woogie Boogie,’ a humorous and inventive reimaging of the boogie woogie blues dance; and Billy Childs’s ‘Incident,’ a single-movement violin sonata / tone poem written as a response to a fatal shooting by police. Another premiere is Wendall Logan’s violin and piano arrangement of Duke Ellington’s 1935 composition, ‘In a Sentimental Mood.’ The album’s title track, Dolores White’s improvisational ‘Blues Dialogues,’ draws on classical, jazz, and country music, as well as African-American vocalizations and a blues harmonic language. David N. Baker’s gospel-tinged ‘Blues (Deliver My Soul)’ evokes the ecstatic energy of a Black church service. Charles S. Brown’s ‘A Song Without Words’ was inspired by bottleneck guitar player and gospel blues master Blind Willie Johnson. Each movement of William Grant Still’s ‘Suite for Violin and Piano’ evokes the work of a different African-American visual artist. Clarence Cameron White’s ‘Levee Dance, Op. 26, No. 2,’ a favorite of violin virtuoso Jascha Heifetz, surrounds a traditional African-American spiritual with a playful, syncopated dance. Coleridge-Taylor Perkinson’s ‘Blue/s Forms’ and ‘Louisiana Blues Strut’ befit a composer with a legacy of achievements in the classical, jazz, modern dance, and pop music worlds.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=CDR%20182&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Violin,,United States,2018 Cedille Records,2018 Cedille Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At this time some of his musical ideas bear a family resemblance to certain themes from Mozart, Haydn and Beethoven, but already his own musical character is evident. He began his Second Symphony in December 1814 and had finished it by March 24th of the following year. He completed the Fourth Symphony in about three to four weeks during April 1816. We should not read too much into the Fourth Symphony’s “Tragic” appendage, added by Schubert as an afterthought. It may be merely an example of the flippant comments which he wrote on some of his youthful scores, but nevertheless the symphony has more gravitas than its predecessors. Schubert also includes a second pair of horns to enrich the texture. Actually, this is the only piece of non-programmatic music to which he gave a descriptive title. After completing the symphonic cycles of Beethoven and Mendelssohn, Jan Willem de Vriend now undertakes Schubert’s complete symphonic output.

More than two centuries had passed since its premiere in Salzburg, and Die Wahrheit der Natur (The Truth of Nature) is now also finally available on this album. Salzburg’s rich theatrical tradition was once inseparably linked to the Benedictine University. The final comedies presented by students at the university at the end of the academic year along with the participation of members of the court ensemble were in particular very popular and open to all local residents. As the music for this delightful comic and didactic poem penned by the Benedictine priest Florian Reichssiegel demonstrates, Michael Haydn also made original contributions to this genre. Reason, in the guise of Mentor, seeks true art with assistance from the three Graces, the daughters of Nature. During their quest for knowledge the four again and again meet curious types like the vain master of song Vollstreich, the braggart painter Wurmstich, and the ill-mannered schoolmaster Bockstolz and his wife Urschel. The plot includes scenes in which the quest for art is portrayed not only as a series of lessons but also as an entertaining adventure.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=555032-2&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,,Germany,2018 cpo,2018 cpo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Italian idiom, Hotteterre’s affinity for Italy and its music, distinguish the structure of his works, and this proximity to the goût italien can also be heard in the four Suites op. 5. Hotteterre modified the French suite type consisting of many pieces in the same key and replaced it with a model practically verging on the sonata form. L’art de préluder, a course offering instruction in the so very important capabilities necessary for improvisation, is another highly interesting work by Hotteterre. Here the composer writes short preludes that could be used to introduce suite cycles in the corresponding keys and were supposed to school and inspire the musician’s own gifts of invention. In his pieces from the valuable volume entitled Airs Ornez d’Agremens Hotteterre arranges familiar melodies of French provenance for two or three flutes and writes Doubles for flute solo.

It is clearly audible that in this majestic orchestral genre he tended to a style with closer ties to the tradition than he did in his works of smaller format. At the same time, however, this symphony is also his strongest and most individual contribution to this genre. In view of its flawless formal proportions, thorough mastery of the highest quality, and characteristic invention, it is really difficult to understand why Larsson withdrew this symphony shortly after its premiere and retained only the finale, now with a new, lengthier slow introduction and the title Concerto Overture No. 3.

The songs brought together on this album represent a significant portion of his multifarious and multifaceted vocal oeuvre and show the whole great breadth of this composer whom his contemporaries described as an »extremely upright character« of the highest artistic seriousness but who occasionally – as his songs to texts by Robert Burns reveal – drew on his humorous vein far removed from any sort of cynicism.

The mid-1950s saw Walter at the height of his powers, and the ‘live’ recordings here are very focused, having a great sense of forward movement and excitement – most notably in Haydn’s Symphony No.96 and Mahler’s Symphony No.1 – compared to some of the studio accounts in the early 1960s when Walter was well into his 80s. The set also contains Walter with the great German soprano Irmgard Seefried in ‘Wo die schönen Trompeten blasen’ from Des Knaben Wunderhorn, which illustrates both her superb artistry and his genius as a Mahler conductor. Brahms’s Song of Destiny (Schicksalslied), a Walter favorite, completes the set. All recordings have been sourced from the Richard Itter archive, as Beecham caught ‘live’ often showed the mercurial side of his character, and no performance was the same either in the studio or in the concert hall. All the performances included here from the Edinburgh Festival, London’s Royal Albert Hall, Royal Festival Hall and the BBC Studios are from Beecham’s final years, from 1954 when he had fully established the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra and himself as central figures in England’s musical life, to 1959 when he conducted an extraordinarily memorable account of Brahms’s Symphony No.2.

In his booklet note, Richard Osborne describes the performance of Beethoven’s Symphony No.5 from the 1958 Edinburgh Festival as “a performance that genuinely gathers itself to greatness.” Klemperer’s performances of the Brahms Requiem were justly famous, and this 1955 ‘live’ account precedes his acclaimed 1961 studio recording and is almost five minutes faster. Gramophone described the latter as follows: “Klemperer’s reading of this mighty work has long been famous: rugged, at times surprisingly fleet with a juggernaut power.” In this ‘live’ performance with the BBC Symphony Orchestra and Chorus, Klemperer is joined by the baritone Hans Wilbrink from the Munich State Opera and the German lyric soprano Elfride Trötschel, a protégée of Karl Böhm.

Alexander Knyazev graduated from the Moscow Conservatory where he studied cello and the Nizhny Novgorod Conservatory where he studied organ. Bach’s music has always been in the artist’s focus of interests. “I try to find an interpretation of Bach’s music that must, first of all, be very living.

In fact, it is the Tower of its own: looking through the list of Rachmaninoff’s works and the names of Russian and Soviet performers in the Rachmaninoff Collection offered by legendary label Melodiya on the composer’s 145th anniversary, one can assume just that. To a great surprise of the scholars and amateurs, such a collection has never been assembled previously. The “Russian idiom” has never been presented in such a massive and powerful way, reaching the “critical mass” that may lead to important conclusions about the Russian musical style and interpretation in general. The list contains the names of great singers from the generation of Soviet classics such as Irina Arkhipova, Ivan Kozlovsky, Georgy Nelepp, Elena Obraztsova, Mark Reisen, to the most current internationally renowned stars such as Hibla Gerzmava. One can find a smorgasbord of chamber music performed by the exceptional ensembles and individuals such as David Oistrakh, Leonid Kogan, Mstislav Rostropovich, Gidon Kremer and Daniil Shafran. An unusual component in the collection is the recordings of Rachmaninoff’s Russian Orthodox church music – something that was carefully shoved under the rug in the Soviet times. The operas are represented by the best that the country could give – and here, for sure, the native Russian diction raises the level of performance to the classical height. And, of course, that poetics of the piano, in which Sergei Rachmaninoff expressed himself in the most unencumbered way, is represented in the Collection by the names that do not need promotion: Sviatoslav Richter, Emil Gilels, Grigory Sokolov, Vladimir Krainev, Alexei Nasedkin, Pavel Serebryakov – the list goes on until it reaches the latest acquisition on the Montparnasse of piano, Dmitry Masleev.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=MELCD1002550&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,,Russia,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

First of all, the famous concertos by Vivaldi: two of them appear here on this intensely romantic album (‘Come une volta’) that Julien Martineau - one of today’s greatest figureheads of the instrument - has recorded for Naïve. We also finally get to hear, thanks to the world premiere recording by Julien Martineau, the legendary, virtuosic and poetic second concerto (of which the manuscript was lost) by Raffaele Calace (1863-1934), who was often described as ""the Paganini of the mandolin"". The instrument is in fact so close, in many ways, to the violin. The Caudioso concerto completes an album which, steeped in authenticity and musical excellence, honors and lends prestige not only to the art of mandolin, but also to Italian and musical culture as a whole.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=V5455&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Orchestral,,France,EMT,Naïve,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Carollo’s fourth Navona Records release, and follow up to 2017’s The Transfiguration of GIovanni Baudino, is a wondrous musical journey through the world of desire. With Music From the Ethereal Side of Paradise, Carollo makes an impassioned plea for the power of romance. From the opening tensions and mystery of “Awakenings for String Orchestra” through the surprising, amorous joy of “Romanzo!” “Splendido Affare,” and “La Tortura dell’ Amore,” Carollo’s compositions communicate what mere words cannot: the inner rapture, utter fulfillment, and yes, the torture, of being in love. Shifting slightly, and perhaps more into the ethereal, “Metamorphosis No. 3 for Solo Violin” introduces a newer, more contemplative element. With short notes and runs, the violin first cries out with unanswered questions followed by furrowed introspection. Two Guitar Etudes follow, demonstrating both intimacy and technique, while maintaining an inquisitive tone throughout. As the album continues, we arrive at a vocal suite with “Little Gems” to be discovered throughout. T.S. Eliot wrote “…the end of all our exploring/Will be to arrive where we started/And know the place for the first time.” Musid From the Ethereal Side of Paradise does just that. Concluding as we began with a sumptuous string orchestra, we arrive where we started – enlightened and wise from our journey.",https://youtu.be/7YbUCWAxPfU,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=NV6148&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Orchestral,,,,2018 Navona Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Each piece demonstrates the unique synergy between the two performers. With twice the hands, twice the talent, and twice the interpretation, the piano is pushed to dynamic and sonoric extremes. Compositions on In Your Head span over five decades, but each is brought to new life by the skilled hands of Muller and Steigerwalt. The duo, who have performed extensively across the Western Hemisphere, found inspiration for this compilation in the success of Lewis Spratlan's Dreamworlds, a piece which they had commissioned in 2015. Using the piano as a canvas, the two paint a psychological landscape exploring the mind within different people, scenarios, and even locations. Sometimes dissonant and flustered, as in ‘Mind Games II. Panic,’ and other times eerie as in ‘The Silent Hearth’ which captures the memories echoing like firing synapses inside a dilapidated concert hall, each piece resonates with the complexity of mental activity. Throughout In Your Head, Steigerwalt and Muller compel listeners to zero in on the thoughts of the panicked soul, the trapped bureaucrat, the obsessed dictator, and the mind control of the lucid dreamer.

Each has a different, unique story to tell, and the narratives are brought to life by the orchestra and string ensemble. Hans Bakker showcases his ‘Canzona III: Hidden in Her Light’ in ternary form. Described by the composer as a “hymn to the sun,” this tone poem is reminiscent of the symphonic storytellings of such greats as Tchaikovsky and Rimsky-Korsakov — with a heritage of folk melodies and rhythms to boot. The extraordinary balance between strings, woodwinds, brass, and percussion is expressed so fluidly, yet individually, the listener is immediately enveloped into the epic saga Bakker is telling. Jan Järvlepp expresses his unique composition style in Suite for Strings. In this incredible pedagogical work, Järvlepp brings the listener through a gamut of emotions. Clive Muncaster’s Redcliffe Gardens Suite for Strings follows suit perfectly with a romantic “Petronella,” enormously expressive in every way. “Pastorella” takes it down a notch, toeing the line between major and minor, somewhat demonstrating the complexity of romantic love. But, obviously, love wins. “Stella” is the heroic ballad to profess it. “Fuga Romantica” layers the sweetness together using one of composition’s most complex forms. Shirley Mier’s Of Lakes and Legends, a programmatic work written for the Century Chamber Orchestra, closes the album. Each movement is set at White Bear Lake in Minnesota, the city where the Century College and the ensemble are located. This celebration of music is tinged with nostalgia, as it both recalls these concerts and reflects on the fact that they now exist only in time past. This, hands down, is contemporary composition at its best. This album has been perfectly curated to offer continuity in the listening experience. PARMA patrons, old and new, will find enormous satisfaction in this collection.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEvNf08-yFg&feature=youtu.be,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=NV6187&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Orchestral,,,,2018 Navona Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fun, energetic, and brimming with rhythmic imagination, it is set against an original percussive backdrop provided by, among others, a vibraslap, a marimba, and a Chinese opera gong. The album's title track, ‘When you are reminded by the instruments,’ is inspired by a verse in Walt Whitman's Leaves of Grass. Like Whitman's poetry, Biggs's composition oscillates between the concrete and the fantastical, while the traditional classical instrumental grouping stands in stark contrast to the decidedly modern soundscape it creates. One of the most personal tracks on the album, ‘The Trill Is Gone’ is a dedication to Biggs's fellow composer and friend, the late Edwin London. This solo saxophone piece paints a memorable portrait of a character that, not unlike its dedicatee, is equal parts nonchalant, mischievous and sophisticated. In the intimate ‘E. M. am Flügel,’ melancholic tenderness meets with moments of precipitous furor. Specifically written for Biggs’s colleague — and the performer on this recording — Eric Moe, the piece includes quotations of Gregorian chants as well as a fragment from one of the Moe's compositions. Played to perfection, the piece is a true reflection of their friendship. This album holds quite a few surprises, and the Wedding Motet is certainly one of them. This choral work, inspired by Biggs's interest in liturgical texts, is steeped in the album's most obviously tonal musical syntax, harking back to the traditions of the Medieval, Renaissance, and Late Romantic periods. Ochila laEil, the composer's first choral piece set in Hebrew, develops a dialogue between a horn and the choir, mirroring the dynamic between cantor and congregation. With its varied moods, it manages to distill the power and serenity of an entire oratorio into less than 14 minutes. In short, When You Are Reminded By The Instruments manages to shed light on Biggs’s incredibly versatile musical output – light which, indeed, is well deserved.",https://youtu.be/gJO0pstsMPo,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=NV6191&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Modern Era,,,,2018 Navona Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The arrangements emote a sophistication that echoes J.S. Bach, one of Cunningham’s greatest inspirations. In the three-part composition Bach Diadem, Cunningham pays tribute to the famed composer and incorporates 18th-century orchestral influence in his compositions. Backed by the Moravian Philharmonic Orchestra and the Croatian Chamber Orchestra, Cunningham uses his compositions to create stories that intertwine darkness and beauty. The instruments interact at the forefront of the pieces as though they are characters in an opera, singing with backdrop of the chamber orchestra. A classic example occurs in the second work, Clarinet Concerto. The composer highlights the clarinet as the protagonist in a fantastic narrative carried by the orchestra. Throughout the three movements, the clarinet creates a conversation which moves the production forward. The somber melodies form a dramatic dialogue with the rest of the orchestra, presenting a chain of events that captures the listener’s attention immediately. The captivating compositions in Mezzanine Seat will ensure to listeners that anywhere they listen to the album, they will feel as though they are sitting in the best seats in the concert hall.",https://youtu.be/ENRtmHwO12k,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=NV6186&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Orchestral,,,,2018 Navona Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

First up is Elizabeth R. Austin's ‘B-A-C-HOMAGE,’ an intricately constructed tribute to the German Baroque composer. Based on Bach's name and his ""Air on G"" respectively, the first and second movements reflect upon the clarity of his work through the lens of Austin's decidedly modern tonal language. John Alan Rose's ‘Sleepy Hollow Suite’ for piano mesmerizes with a timeless appeal that bridges centuries: aesthetically gratifying and inventive all at once, Washington Irving could fittingly have imagined this as a soundtrack for his eponymous story. ‘Bells and Grass,’ composed by Juliana Hall, brings five poems by Walter de la Mare to life with only a soprano and an oboe. A related theme could be discerned in Ryan Jesperson's ‘Icarus,’ a riveting duo for alto saxophone and piano. Like the eponymous mythological character, it starts out soaring, but undergoes a considerable transformation, culminating in a spectacular fashion. There is nothing random about Frank Vasi's saxophone quartet ‘Random Thoughts’: the four-movement work is so refreshingly tonal, as well as rhythmically and harmonically engaging, that it wouldn't be out of place in an upscale jazz venue. The quirky ‘Picasso's Rag’ sounds exactly how one would imagine it according to the title – only better. Nancy Tucker brings the album to a close with two of her playful, upbeat compositions. ‘Escape of the Slinkys’ imagines the life of named perennial childhood toy with bewildering depth of imagination. ‘Grasshopper's Holiday,’ an unapologetically catchy guitar piece, evokes images of road trips and carefree summers with such cheerful drive that one might find it difficult to stop listening to it on repeat. With its variegated selection, Spectra 2 packs a veritable punch in just about one hour of music – music composed in Connecticut, but with an artistic appeal that easily transcends the borders of the Constitution State.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8LyB_1OBrQ&feature=youtu.be,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=NV6188&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Modern Era,,,,2018 Navona Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On each of the album’s ten tracks, McEnroe has crafted a musical painting, a work of art that describes, as it were, his reflections on the subject alluded to in its title. The concepts for these very personal compositions, which were brought to life by the noted Janacek Philharmonic Orchestra under the direction of Anthony Armore, fall into two basic categories. The five selections on the first portion of the release talk of the wonders of the natural world, of bio-diversity, and of the power of the seasons. From the spry energy of ‘That Old Indian Summer’, to the majestic dignity of ‘Movements in the Night’, McEnroe’s talent for creating compositions that evoke both image and emotion is on vibrant display. The second half features two tracks that also explore ecological terrain. Those are combined with three distinctively introspective compositions which musically portray the joys and difficulties that are a part of daily life. The tumultuous beginning of ‘The Passing’, which the composer says is “about letting go of old ideas that are no longer relevant,” evolves, as the music becomes brighter, to reflect the promise of a hopeful future. ‘Echoes from a Haunted Past’ captures the frustration at not having resolved issues from the past. Those tracks bookend the playful, pastoral ‘A Pageant at the County Fair.’ In his rather brief career, Mark John McEnroe has composed pieces that have been performed by solo pianists as well as by full orchestras. My Symphonic Poems, the latest addition to his robust body of work, confirms that his capacity to portray both ambiance and emotion is truly boundless.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzOF9t7E2KA&feature=youtu.be,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=NV6189&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Orchestral,,,,2018 Navona Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The eloquent and sprightly Fifth Symphony is a celebration of ‘the heritage of my dear father,’ who was also a talented musician and an important figure in Alexander’s development as a composer. The Sixth Symphony is notable for its clarity and symmetry, from the simple theme of its opening to the brilliant contrapuntal fugato in its closing movement.

Bach’s Christmas Oratorio was written for the Christmas season of 1734, and although it incorporates music from earlier works it belongs firmly among his timeless large-scale compositions. The development of the oratorio, which was to become a new musical form in Protestant church services at that time, was stimulated by Bach’s compositions, particularly by the unusual form of his six-part Christmas Oratorio. From its famously joyful opening ‘Jauchzet frohlocket’ to the arrival of the Wise Men from the East, this work’s enduring popularity has long proven its status as a choral ‘evergreen.’ For the conductor Ralf Otto, flexibility, diversity and transparency of sound have always been essential to his work with choirs and orchestras.

The Sonatas Op. 38, Nos. 1 & 2 can be heard on the 2nd volume of this edition, which was “unreservedly recommended” by Fanfare magazine. Violinist Eric Grossman is a versatile performer hailed for his flawless technique, superb musicianship, and commitment to a wide range of repertoire.

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries Argentine composers tended to study in Europe or North America, and the result was the appearance of a number of striking personalities who eventually attracted worldwide attention. Three names now stand out: Alberto Ginastera, Mauricio Kagel, and Astor Piazzolla. In addition to these stylistically extreme figures, a number of quality composers remained known principally only within Argentina. The leading creative figure among them was Carlos Guastavino. Guastavino’s music remained firmly based in the language of the late 19th and early 20th century, maintaining that music should be based on singable melody and tonal harmony, and written for the here and now, not for discovery by future generations. He succeeded instead in creating a national music that was genuinely popular and accessible to a very wide audience.

My works are organic and, at every level, concerned with transformations and connections. The carefully sculpted musical materials of Brio are agile and energized, and their flexibility allows a way to braid harmonic, rhythmic, and contrapuntal elements that are constantly transformed — at times whimsical and light, at times jazzy, at times layered and reverberating. Across Brio’s 11-minute duration, it unfolds a labyrinth of musical interrelationships and connections that showcase the musicians of the Des Moines Symphony in a virtuosic display of rhythmic agility, counterpoint, skill, energy, dynamic range, clarity, and majesty. Throughout the kaleidoscopic journey, the work passes through many lively and colorful episodes and, via an extended, gradual crescendo, reaches a full-throttle, sparkling intensity — imagine a coiled spring releasing its energy to continuously propel the musical discourse. Vivid, clangorous, brassy, and blazing, Brio culminates in music of enthusiastic, intrepid (almost Stravinsky-like) spirits while never losing its sense of dance, caprice, and effervescence.”",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=NMP1052&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,,United Kingdom,2018 Augusta Read Thomas,2018 Augusta Read Thomas,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the music, worlds, real and imaginary are encapsulated, touched and experienced. Occasionally, we feel tangibly close to the action, but often we are mere onlookers from afar- now locked in the icy waters of ‘Zustande,’ where we find ourselves aurally trapped within the cracking ice, now isolated on the banks of ‘On the Other Shore,’ calling across the water to a loved one where distance is felt most longingly. Inspired by Marco Polo’s depictions of Venice, water again is the fundamental element within ‘Invisible Cities.’ Distance, in ‘The Sun was Chasing Venus’ is felt from above, flying high in the skies, where movement and proximity are perceived very differently. ‘Beyond’ also relates to this realm, outside the limitations of the world we inhabit.

It seems that it can obviously be either or both, and that there is a huge continuum of language between those musical gestures that are truly universal and those which are almost as personal as a fingerprint. One of the things I find most compelling about Philip’s music is the extent to which it embodies the extremes of both the universal and the personal. As Philip’s output grows and our understanding of his work evolves, we can begin to see that there are musical threads which spill over from one work to the next. In this respect, he is part of a venerable tradition. Sometimes these recurring themes and motifs have profound personal significance, sometimes they are simply, as Philip once said to me of a particular rhythmic motif which appears in the vast majority of his pieces at least once, “very useful.”",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=NI6374&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Orchestral,,United Kingdom,2018 Wyastone Estate Limited,2018 Wyastone Estate Limited under exclusive licence from Philip Sawyers,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These works cover the full gamut of emotions, from extreme passions and extravagant virtuosity to the most intimate and profound expressions of poetic introspection, with elegant dances inserted for good measure. The violin that Schmelzer played was likely made by Jacob Stainer, the most celebrated luthier in Europe, whose violins were renowned for their fine silvery tone and considered superior to Cremonese models.

Hearing Li Xiangting play the qin is just that kind of experience: extremely refined compositions, both rich and contrasting, in a climate of total dedication to the service of this repertoire, over a thousand years old. What is so amazing with qin music, is the way it can be immediately and universally appreciated even beyond its very rich and specifically Chinese context. The sensuality of its sound is heightened by complex variations in which virtuosity is at all times for expressive effect. In spite of the many upheavals that China has undergone, the art of the qin remains timeless, faithfully handed down from master to disciple from generation to generation, mainly in writing. Each link in the chain is indispensable and in this respect Li Xiangting occupies a privileged place, being the direct descendant of the greatest masters: Zha Fuxi (1895-1976) and Wu Jinglue (1907-1987).

So, the work is permeated by a permanent presentiment of death. At the same time, Mahler’s music vibrates full of vital energy, putting the listener in a melancholic, yet optimistic mood simultaneously. The result is a harrowing work with moving passages and violent explosions, mirroring Mahler’s personal drama between life and death. The present recording from the Essen Philharmonie (April 2018) is a perfect proof of all these facts. Tomas Netopil took up the position of General Music Director of the Aalto Theatre and Philharmonie Essen at the start of the 2013/14 season.

These recordings highlight the art of Julian Anderson and are a unique testimony of artistic collaboration and friendship between him and the conductor that lasted for 37 years. Julian Anderson was commissioned to write a substantial work for solo mezzo-soprano, chorus, and orchestra for the 2006 BBC Proms. This resulted in the creation of ‘Heaven is Shy of Earth,’ an oratorio based on texts by poet Emily Dickinson. The work also features texts of a Latin mass. Despite the predominance of Latin religious texts, this is not a sacred work. The insertions change the whole structure away from denominational Christianity and bring the liturgy out and into the natural world as a sort of secular Eucharist- a celebration and sanctification of nature itself. This substantial work ends in a beautiful climax of harmonious ecstasy, a movement which the composer added in 2010. ‘The Comedy of Change’ is a work for 12 instruments which pays tribute to Charles Darwin and celebrates the 150th anniversary of the publication of his book ‘The Origin of Species.’ The composer intended the work to function as both a free-standing concert piece and the score of a ballet.

These two chamber music masterpieces by Antonín Dvorák express great emotional depth and dark passion. The two piano trios by Dvorak featured in this album have remarkable similarities as well as differences. Piano Trio No. 3, nearly symphonic in its character, hints to the world of Johannes Brahms, while the Piano Trio No. 4 includes folkloric elements. The third piano trio might not only be considered as an homage to Brahms; it was written by the composer in 1883 shortly after the death of his mother which might well explain the sorrowful musical expression in the slow movement of the work. The ‘Dumky’ trio has a very unusual structure in its six movements. This intense and intimate work was written just prior to the composer’s departure to New York in 1891 and serves as a great climax for Dvorak’s series of piano trios.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=ODE%201316-2&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,,Finland,"2018 Ondine Oy, Helsinki","2018 Ondine Oy, Helsinki",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Simon Gjoni, Cesk Zadeja and Tonin Harapi belong to the first generation of professional composers from Albania, all born in the 1920s, studying abroad but returning to the capital and artistic hub, Tirane, to lead cultural life while the country suffered from comparative international isolation in the 1950s and 60s. It is to this later generation that Pellumb Vorpsi, Thomas Simaki and Vasil Tole belong. The Adriatic culture shared by Albania and Italy is celebrated in several bilingually titled works such as Ja gëzimi kthen përsëri, (La gioia ritorna ancora) by Harapi, whose works are among the simplest, briefest and most charming on the album. At the other end of the scale, pianistically speaking, are the Lisztian Variations on a Popular Theme by Vorpsi. Even so, both composers, and most of the others, share a direct, fresh, folk-inspired mode of expression that carries with it strains of Bartók and Vaughan Williams, to name two more noted ethno musicological explorers in the early years of the last century. The piano music presented here is generally in traditional style, highly attractive, alternating melancholy romanticism and joyous, rhythmically vibrant folk music. This album marks the debut of Marsida Koni (b.1981) on Piano Classics. An Albanian native, she grew up in her home country and made her broadcast debut at the age of just nine, and her orchestral concerto debut two years later. Having graduated from the university in Tirane, she pursued further studies in Italy, where she now makes her career. She has a recorded partnership with the clarinettist Piero Vincenti, and she is artistic director of the Lazar Berman International Piano Competition in Camerino in the Marche region of northern Italy.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=PCL10149&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,,Germany,2018 Piano Classics,2018 Piano Classics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here are three sonatas from the ‘Silver Age’ of Russian music from the turn of the last century, all exploiting a virtuoso technique to the full. The narrative arc and harmonies of Robert Schumann’s music make their mark on the rippling arpeggios and ardent lyricism of the Second Sonata by Alexander Glazunov. The Guardian also praised Maltempo’s handling of Schumann on a recent album of the Sonata Op.14 and other, less-familiar works: with his ‘intimate, delicately colored accounts’, ‘it’s clear in every phrase here that Maltempo is much, much more than just an Alkan specialist.’ Least known of the composers here is the Ukrainian Victor Kosenko (1896-1938), whose sonatas have long attracted pianists in search of grand statements in the Lisztian tradition. The three movements of the Second are laid out on a relatively compact scale that belies their technical demands and majestic vein of expression; any listener who appreciates the architecture of Medtner’s sonatas will find much to enjoy in Kosenko. The four-movement sonata by Balakirev begins with a modestly self-contained Andantino but builds through a stamping mazurka and ardent intermezzo to a finale of exhilarating drive and passion on the scale of the composer’s Islamey, which remains a barnstorming showpiece for virtuoso pianists at the highest level. On this showing, Maltempo may certainly be counted among them. Italian pianist Vincenzo Maltempo, one of the most interesting pianists of the young generation, is clearly at home in this repertoire, which he showed in his staggering recording of the Transcendental Studies by Lyapunov (PCL0124), which received 5 stars in several classical magazines.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=PCL10159&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,,Germany,2018 Piano Classics,2018 Piano Classics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At 14 years of age, he took over the office of cathedral organist from his deceased father. In 1844, though, he moved to Paris, the hub of European music, where he remained until his death in 1900. It was there that he assumed a prestigious post in 1849, taking over at the Great Organ in the Church of Saint-Sulpice. He became very active as a composer and writer, published organ works and papers on the organ and the reform of church music and also co-founded a congress that aimed to re-establish “true” church music. Schmitt was gradually forgotten after the Franco-Prussian War of 1870/71. The performance of a comic opera and operettas at minor theatres and his participation in national composition competitions with cantatas and great choral symphonies did not give the composer the breakthrough he hoped for. Nonetheless, he published numerous piano pieces and songs as well as theoretical and educational works. This album features just about half of Schmitt’s surviving French songs. They were individually published in Paris between 1855 and 1890 and some have survived in handwritten form.

What clearly distinguishes it from other concertos is its symbiosis of orchestra and pianist. What I mean is that the orchestra and pianist are very closely interlinked so as to give the concerto a thoroughly symphonic complexion. It is known that Brahms originally conceived the work as a symphony. It stands to reason, therefore, that this work should sound symphonic. The task set before the pianist when tackling this work is a very tall order, namely the challenge of playing a 50-minute concerto and, throughout every minute, immersing oneself in the music without losing sight of the overall picture. A useful analogy might be to imagine a mountainous landscape and, whilst enjoying the harmony and unity of the mountains, also to observe their slightest elevations and hollows. I believe that nature abounds in this work, as if I were to breathe in the fresh mountain air, feel its vigor and visualize scenic colors. I have put so much time and energy into this concerto. By giving so many concerts, I was able to thoroughly immerse myself in the music and experiment with it 13 times. So I think I’m justified in saying that it has become my concerto.“",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=PH18065&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,,Austria,2018 Profil Medien GmbH,2018 Profil Medien GmbH,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The title track was written in a small compartment backstage at Malmö Arena in Sweden prior to a show with Swedish pop star Orup. The Karin Hammar Fab 4 line up includes some of Sweden’s finest jazz players: Niklas Fernqvist on bass, Fredrik Rundqvist on drums and new member, guitarist, Andreas Hourdakis who brings a new form, shape, and level to the group’s sound.

It is the first recording of the Vespers in the alternative version proposed by the composer, without concertato instruments. It reveals the underlying matrix of the work we all know, the ‘original version’ to which Monteverdi added concertato instruments for use in large-scale performances. Respecting the structure of the Office of Vespers, Ludus Modalis has chosen to frame the psalms with the antiphons corresponding to a Marian ceremony. The interpretation proposed here is one influenced by the Renaissance tradition. It places the work in perspective in a musical world at the point of equilibrium between prima and seconda prattica, between the achievements of tradition and the contributions of modernity. Ludus Modalis is a professional ensemble of five to twelve singers formed around the tenor Bruno Boterf. The group focuses principally on polyphonic Renaissance and early Baroque repertoire, with incursions into contemporary music. Apart from the absence of a conductor in the standard sense, the ensemble’s specificity and its ‘sound blend’ are the fruits of thoroughgoing attention to the parameters of a cappella polyphony: the development of an intonation aimed towards achieving a clarity of harmonic intervals; the attention paid to the text on the basis of the declamation and historical pronunciation; and the richness of the sonority achieved through the use of a variety of vocal timbres and colors, as well as a subtle mix of female, male, and even children’s voices.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=RAM1702&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Baroque Era,,Austria,2018 Outhere,2018 Outhere,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Technology performer Jeff Morris is joined by free jazz icon Karl Berger on vibes and piano as well as innovative New York percussionist Joe Hertenstein. Morris takes sounds from his partners live in the moment and transforms them into his own musical voice with the DNA of acoustic sounds and the fingerprints of digital processing. This live sampling improvisation results in expressively shifting quasi-loops and glitchy melodic gestures, drawn from music that just happened and influencing what the performers will do next. Call it a twenty-first century version of imitative counterpoint, as in J. S. Bach’s classic fugues. Taking inspiration from, among others, free jazz legend Ornette Coleman and Brian Eno’s early rebellious sound, Morris builds different digital instruments and interactive environments to produce unique encounters with the jazz world. He uses every stutter, glitch, and clash as a chance to discover new kinds of beauty. The native voice of the technology sings freely instead of pretending to be other instruments or remixing classic recordings. At times, Interfaces can feel like an aural puzzle that challenges the mind as much as the ear.

Titled by the works first published following Schubert’s death, ‘Swansong’ D 957 sets the words of poets Ludwig Rellstab, Heinrich Heine and Johann Gabriel Seidl in songs that cover a variety of different emotional states. The lighthearted ‘Love Message’ with its rippling accompaniment, addresses a murmuring brook with the hope of true love. The bone- chilling ‘Doppelganger’ with its stark, slowly tolling chords, finds the protagonist crazed with a nocturnal vision of himself agonizing at the empty doorstep of his lost love. Renowned for his clear diction and powerful voice, Sir John Tomlinson brings his insight and nuance to these profound works. Reminiscent of the scoring for The Shepherd on the Rock and composed in the same year, ‘On the River’ combines soprano, clarinet and horn in a setting of a poem by Ludwig Rellstab. Originally given to Beethoven who did not live long enough to set it, Schubert took up the words in a work that is a subtle homage to the composer. The 1828 work The Shepherd on the Rock sets words by Wilhelm Muller and German playwright Helmina von Chezy, and was composed in gratitude to the soprano Anna Milder-Hauptmann. Here performed by Sophie Bevan and Julian Bliss, it tells the story of a shepherd lamenting the distance between him and his beloved before a reflection on loneliness and grief.

The third symphony is written in one movement, but you can distinguish three blocks and a concluding part, ‘the reminiscence’- in which the accumulated power reverts to the original nothingness in the end. The third symphony was begun in 1971 in Jamtland and was completed in 1975 at Salto in Bohuslan. As in most of Lundquist’s symphonies, this symphony begins with a primal cell, his association theme, a gust of wind, which unfolds into a grandiose sunrise. Nature means a lot for Lundquist. The idea for the Symphony No. 3- which also had the title Sinfonia dolorosa and is dedicated to the composer’s deceased wife Maud- he got during a mountain hike, shortly after his wife’s death. The symphony was first performed in September 1976 in Malmo, by Malmo Symphony Orchestra conducted by Janos Furst. Lundquist was working on the fourth symphony for several years, mainly in 1984-85. Also this is in a single long, mighty, movement. It is almost twice as long as the third symphony, and it is also written for large orchestra with extensive percussion. After the premiere in Gothenburg in October 1985, with the Gothenburg Symphony under the direction of Sixten Ehrling, who also got the dedication, the composer withdrew the score and revised it slightly a year later. “Performance, yes- because the composition does not feel completely finished until I heard it,” says Lundquist.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=CDM3004&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Orchestral,,United Kingdom,2018 Sterling Records,2018 Sterling Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There are also a number of French artists who only fulfill these stereotypes to a modest degree. Olivier Messiaen, however, is most decidedly the least “French” of any composer to come out of the country known for its measured, discreet treatment of music. When asked about his aesthetics, he at first doubted that he had any at all, but then dared to express the much quoted confession: “I can probably say that my preference is for colorfully resplendent, refined, even voluptuous music, a kind of music that is familiar with tenderness and vehemence, love and impetuosity; a kind of music that moves listeners back and forth, that sings out; a kind of music that is invigorated by fresh blood, that knows about unmistakable gestures, that exudes a scent never before perceived, like a restless bird…”",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=SWR19421CD&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,,Germany,1999-2008 SWR Media Service GmbH,2018 Naxos Deutschland GmbH,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rosbaud is an expert at presenting Mozart's charming and instantaneously fascinating melodics without trivialization and exaggerated sentiment. Hans Rosbaud was an undemonstrative conductor. Bernard Haitink has recalled that ‘…as he approached the podium you thought, surely that can’t be the conductor’, yet he achieved excellent results. As the Chicago-based critic Robert C. Marsh commented in a review of Rosbaud’s first concert with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra in January 1959, ‘This modest, self-effacing conductor has authority, an ear for color and a sense of style. He is a musician to hear rather than watch... He seems to have the most naive idea of showmanship, but his musicianship cannot be questioned.’ The esteem in which he was held by his contemporaries was illustrated by the composer Francis Poulenc’s comment, quoted in Paris-Match in November 1954, that ‘The taste of music buffs little resembles that of professional musicians. Music buffs believe that the greatest living conductor is Toscanini; musicians know that it is Hans Rosbaud.’ And another major French composer, Pierre Boulez, regards Rosbaud as a model of what a conductor should be.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=SWR19066CD&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Orchestral,,Germany,1951-1962 SWR Media Services GmbH,2018 Naoxs Germany GmbH,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The rendition of a four-handed piece on the harpsichord or the fortepiano can be considered an example of the direction that music of the second half of the eighteenth century was about to take: light-hearted, convivial, and educational, in which quality existed alongside the intention to satisfy the new “galant” tastes of the aristocracy, as well as the needs of the rising middle class. The four-handed genre becomes, in this regard, an ideal setting to express the new musical feeling. Four hands can double possibilities and exploit the keyboard’s full range. The search for expressivity is maintained by combining extended melodies with arpeggios or broken chords. In the case of performance on the harpsichord, the increased opportunity to “mix” the stops facilitates the search for unexplored colors and contrasts. On a historical copy of the famous harpsichord maker Martin Sassmann, Alberto Firrincieli and Mario Stefano Tonda perform the singular repertoire that sees protagonists Nicolò Jommelli, Muzio Clementi and Giovanni Maria Rutini, in these compositions reflecting their different peculiarities.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=TC710002&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Classical Era,,Austria,2018 Tactus Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Virtuoso flutists such as Philibert Rebillè, Michel de la Borre, Pierre Gabriel Buffordin, Michel Blavet, Johann Joachim Quantz and his noble pupil Frederick II of Prussia were undoubtedly a source of inspiration for the composers of the baroque and galant periods who composed music for the transverse flute and produced pieces that became landmarks in the history of music; but it was also thanks to the diffusion of the instrument among amateurs that the transverse flute repertoire was enriched by an extraordinary number of compositions, many of which were exquisite works.

This album, performed by Sandro Volta and Mauro Bonelli, is focused on one of the least considered aspects, yet very important for the formation of a musician: the music for two guitars in its fundamental meaning: on one hand exquisitely concertistic pieces, on the other hand dedicated to pure didactics - real “Lessons” - for which the compositions for two performers are particularly important. The interpretation of these works by Ferdinando Carulli was developed on the basis of the use of two period guitars with catgut strings from the collection of Lorenzo Frignani, in Modena, and on a “historically informed” performance practice. The result is aesthetically quite different from that obtained with modern instruments: its distinctive qualities are a more audible “noise” when the fingers pluck the strings or run over them, a more marked difference in the timbres of the various ranges, and also a particular lightness of sound.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=TC770303&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Guitar,,Austria,2018 Tactus Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A simple dramaturgic path - somehow almost evanescent and oneiric - was built to form the spoken part, composed by reading a miscellany of poems and proses written by poets and soldiers who took part in the Great War or wrote about it. The music was written by Pier Paolo Scattolin in 2017: in addition to the original material evocative echoes can be heard of some melodies sung in the “ordinary custom” of life in the trenches, during the alienating and often long pauses of the aberrant war activity. Threnody is not a commemorative “musical”, but a space in time and sound to reflect upon man’s acting. To reflect upon the soldiers’ reasons, reactions and visions giving way to behaviors significantly different from those of the high officers in charge, thus unmasking the squalid strategies of the political power.

All three pieces demonstrate Marco Stroppa’s highly sensitive experimentation with sounds at the threshold of audibility. As a philosopher of sound, all sonorities are for him instruments of epistemology; as a musical poet, he tells stories with sensual, tactile, dynamic, and constantly changing sounds, the interpretation of which is always left up to the individual listener. The string quartet ""Un Segno nello Spazio"" (1994) deals with the idea of a sign in space that undergoes an intense increase of density, making the three-dimensionality of the space palpable. In the seven miniature movements of ""Hommage à Gy. K."" for clarinet, viola, and piano (1997–2003), Stroppa honors the Hungarian composer György Kurtág. The performers repeatedly change their positions on the stage, creating differing effects which can be experienced purely acoustically thanks to skillfully managed microphone placement and audio mastering. In ""Osja, Sieben Strophen für eine literarische Drohne"" (2005/2013) for violin, violoncello, and piano, Stroppa reflects on the life of the Russian poet Joseph Brodsky through two of his poems.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=WER73722&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Chamber Music,,Austria,2018 Wergo,2018 Wergo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He is a charismatic performer with an incredibly strong voice and musical vision. His dynamic playing crosses boundaries and genres thanks to a light, elegant touch that conveys a full spectrum of deep emotions and contrasts. As a solo artist, Nitai Hershkovits’ repertoire consists mainly of original work written for piano, giving space for interpretation. Nitai started playing the clarinet at the age of twelve, only to discover his love for the piano at age fifteen. Around that time, he was first exposed to the sound of jazz giants such as Wynton Kelly and Sonny Clark. By the age of seventeen, Nitai had moved to Tel Aviv to combine regular school with private music and piano lessons under the guidance of jazz educators Amit Golan and Yuval Cohen. In 2011, Nitai joined bassist Avishai Cohen’s group. As part of Cohen’s Trio as well as of other symphonic projects, they recorded three albums together. In 2016 Nitai relocated to New York City and is keeping a busy schedule, touring and recording. New Place Always is a collection of melodies that have resonated through time, long enough to evoke a sense of folkloric familiarity. Nitai writes: “Before the recording, I had all kinds of ideas, but we wanted the music to fit the piano and the room, so I wrote most of it there. The rest of the tunes consist of songs that were composed in NY and hand-picked renditions of music by people who inspired me at that time. Even though it has been 17 years since I took my first Piano lesson, its’ familiarity doesn’t reveal itself fully-- it is almost like coming back to a place I've visited before, yet have never been to.”",https://youtu.be/HIVT5VAiZWU,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=yeb-7788&medium=phy,02 Jazz,Jazz,,,Germany,werner aldinger,werner aldinger,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When medievist/archivist André Nieuwlaat initially shared his discoveries (much more Dowland lute music) with lutenist Mike Fentross two years ago, he realized immediately their importance. Every composer has his own musical signature. Trusting the experience that Mike Fentross has gained throughout his thirty-year career as a professional lute player, and as Professor of Lute at the Royal Conservatory of The Hague for the last 15 years, he started to make a selection from all the pieces in the pertinent manuscripts. He let himself be guided by musical intuition, by the essence of the pieces, and by constantly asking himself the question: do I recognize Dowland's hand in this? The overall quality of the pieces to choose from was very impressive, and the answer to this question was: ‘ Yes, I recognize Dowland in these works, without a shadow of a doubt’.
