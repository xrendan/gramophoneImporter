With tracks ranging from sacred to secular, and from delicate to aggressive, the surprising cohesiveness of the composers’ work is astonishingly beautiful and impassioned. Schola Cantorum Coralina and Vocal Luna contribute exquisite vocals to the proceedings. L Peter Deutsch’s Dance to the Revolution, takes inspiration from the writing of Emma Goldman. The composer explains, “what drew me to her writing was her inclusion of interpersonal relationships, not only political or economic ones, in the vision of ideal society.” Deutch’s Where Everything is Music transports the listener to Havana. Conrado Monier’s Gozando’s En La Habana received mention in the Choral Music Contest sponsored by the Cuban Agency of Musical Copyright and the Cuban Music Institute. Monier’s second composition on Coro Del Mundo, Gozando En La Habana, is an a capella tour de force effortlessly conjuring up the sights and sounds of the City of Columns. Cuban composer and conductor Guido López-Gavilán’s Qué Rico É! is a shimmering choral mambo that leaves the listener breathless. Vocal Luna’s contribution to Coro Del Mundo is profound. On Cemento Ladrillo Y Arena, Murmullo, and Silencio their voices range from brassy brilliance to delicate, angelic whispers. Nowhere is this more apparent than their performance of Cynthia Folio’s four-part piece At the Edge of Great Quiet. J.A. Kawarsky’s Sacred Rights, Sacred Song also shines with Vocal Luna’s participation. Sacred Rights, Sacred Song, a multi-movement piece, envisions Israel as a healthy Jewish democracy in which the spiritual civil rights of all Jews are protected. Michael Murray’s El Lunar, based on a poem by Juan Clemente Zenea, depicts the adoration of a beautiful woman. Caminando, based Nicolás Guillén’s poem focuses on the extreme poverty and scarcity faced by many Cubans in the 1930’s. The extraordinary desperation and bleakness Guillén depicts is emphasized by the implication of cannibalism toward the end of the piece. Both of Murray’s pieces are lush with solemn, hypnotic tone. Meira Warshauer’s We Are Dreamers is an adaptation of the Jewish psalm Shir Hamalot. With its blend of religious and cultural influences, Coro Del Mundo is proof that different faiths and beliefs can sit together comfortably at the same musical table.",https://youtu.be/BPReYlfkNgs,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=AR0008&medium=phy#,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Choral,,,2018 Ansonica Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the close connection between music and the educated middle class was taken for granted, the act of composing- either as a dilettante or as a professional- was still considered a hazardous venture. Hardly anyone could devote himself or herself entirely to composition without additional income from performance or teaching. Sommer took his first composition lessons in the 1850s, while studying mathematics and physics. Finally, in 1881, at the age of 47, Sommer withdrew to devote himself entirely to his musical inclinations. These songs require a wide range in terms of pitch and dynamics, long breath, and a differentiated approach to the text that is not easy to combine with the long phrases and wide-ranging legato slurs, and Baritone Sebastian Noack has mastered these skills.

Tenor Kurt Streit is Lucio Silla, and soprano Patricia Petibon is Giunia for the last time, after having gained international recognition thanks to her numerous performances in this role, while mezzo-soprano Silvia Tro Santafe is the ardent Cecilio. In this monumental production, Claus Guth finds a way to respect both the classical setting and the formal innovations that make the opera so interesting.

In 1786 he decided to regale his visitors with a contest involving what were then the two most popular forms of vocal music for the stage: Italian opera and the German Singspiel. And so he commissioned two works from two composers, both of them outstanding in their respective fields, each work to involve the same basic arrangement. For the Italian opera the choice fell on Antonio Salieri, the director of music at the Vienna Court Opera, while Mozart was chosen to write the German Singspiel. The first performance took place at a magnificent gala at Schönbrunn 1786, when two stages were set up, one at each end of the Orangery. This musical contest produced no outright winner, Joseph II having been astute enough to offer his visitors only the crème de la crème of singers and composers. Salieri’s stature as an opera composer was abundantly demonstrated by Nikolaus Harnoncourt when he conducted Prima la musica at the Mozart Week Festival in Salzburg in 2002 – but at no point was Mozart’s own reputation impugned in consequence.

2018,BC,Berlin Classics,0301058BC,885470010588,Felix Mendelssohn-Bartholdy; Aribert Reimann; Robert Schumann ,Schumann Quartett: Intermezzo,Schumann Quartet; Anna Lucia Richter,1,CD,27.29,41.99,"Interest in the Schumann Quartet ignited long before the release of the ensemble’s last album, Landscapes. The combination of Liisa Randalu, Erik, Ken and Mark Schumann represents youthful vigor combined with intelligent circumspection and vision. With the release of Intermezzo they forge a link to their previous album by presenting an equally charming and sensitive choice of repertoire linked to their namesake, Robert Schumann. Their point of departure and focus is his String Quartet no. 1 in A minor. The Schumann Quartet musicians concentrate unconditionally on the vocal part-writing, and rather than merely overcoming the technical challenges choose to simply ignore them. The music of Felix Mendelssohn is suffused with what Schumann envied as “ease” or “facility”. The String Quartet no. 1 in E-flat major was written in the late summer of 1829, when the younger composer was not yet 20. The correlations, corresponding references and tributes are all in evidence – Mendelssohn’s string quartet is the perfect match for Schumann’s equivalent work. Schumann and Mendelssohn provide the framework into which Aribert Reimann then sets “his” Schumann. Reimann is one of today’s most successful composers and is linked to the composer of the Romantic era born in Zwickau, Saxony, by more than music. The Adagio zum Gedenken an Robert Schumann (adagio to the memory of Robert Schumann) based on two unfinished chorales without words was composed as a result of intensive and personal cooperation between the quartet and Reimann. In Reimann’s arrangement of the 6 Gesänge op. 109, the ensemble succeeds, in harmony with the soprano Anna Lucia Richter, in fulfilling Schumann’s wish for an “additional, fully-formed accompanying instrument”. Reimann’s skill in handling the original brings out the fine features and nuances of the lyrics. The quartet and singer complement each other so effortlessly that the unusual combination sounds like a quintet that has been working together for many years.",https://youtu.be/2JEbgpX9oaM,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=0301058BC&medium=phy#,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Chamber Music,Germany,2018 Edel Germany GmbH,2018 Edel Germany GmbH,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Throughout the series he continues to develop the three genres which are featured in it – sonata, rondo and fantasia. In the sixth collection, the fantasias and rondos continue to resemble each other in structure and in stylistic features: abrupt tempo changes, disruptive rhythms, and constant harmonic non sequiturs. Bach gives them ample dimensions, but as in previous collections he continues to reduce the length of the sonatas, to the point that Sonata No. 1 is the shortest work of the collection, although it is in three distinct movements. On this amply-filled album, Miklós Spányi also includes four other works from Carl Philipp's last decade which in various ways underline the composer's boundless curiosity. The Sonata in G major, Wq 65/48 was composed for an experimental keyboard instrument with a bowing device coupled to it – a 'Bogenclavier' – while Bach in the set of variations Wq 118/9 gives us his own take on La Folia, the harmonic scheme that almost a century earlier had inspired composers such as Corelli, Marin Marais and Vivaldi, as well as his own father, in the famous ‘Peasant Cantata’.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=BIS-2263&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Baroque Era,Sweden,2018 BIS Records,2018 BIS Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He was also suspicious of virtuoso interpreters – among which violinists were particularly numerous – and their tendency to 'seek immediate triumphs and to lend themselves to the wishes of the public'. Nevertheless there are in Stravinsky's oeuvre a number of works featuring a solo violin, all of which have now been recorded by his compatriot Ilya Gringolts. The focus of the preceding volume was on the works for violin and piano, most of them Stravinsky's arrangements of his own music for the stage, and Gringolts and pianist Peter Laul were praised for their performances, for instance in Fanfare: 'The Russian duo has discovered – and created – new freshness in the sound of Stravinsky's music for the instrument. Urgently recommended.' On the present release, Gringolts combines duos – again in the company of Laul – with other genres, including Stravinsky's most famous work for the violin: his Violin Concerto from 1931.

By this time he had also begun to make his mark as a composer, and during his years at the court he would add several pieces for the harp to his list of works, inspired by the young harpist Dorette Scheidler. Spohr later recalled his reaction to her playing: ‘I was so deeply moved that I could scarce restrain my tears... I took my leave – but my heart remained behind!’ Only months later, the two were in fact married and Spohr began to compose works which would form the repertoire during future concert tours. Dorette Spohr played a so-called single-action pedal harp of a similar type to the instrument used on this album. Soon to be replaced by the double-action pedal system, the single-action pedal harp was best suited for playing in flat keys. As Spohr preferred writing his violin parts in sharp keys, which allowed the resonance of the open strings, he adopted the method of tuning the harp a semitone lower, which had the added benefit of reducing the tension on the strings. The Sonatas Opp 113-115, in D and G major, therefore have harp parts notated in E flat and A flat major respectively. Because of its delicate construction and stringing, the single-action harp has a distinct silvery bell-like sound and these sonatas are among the last important works specifically written for it. They are also the most demanding, but it is clear that Spohr intended them to display not only the technical skill of the two artists but also their musical expressiveness. The performers here are Masumi Nagasawa and Cecilia Bernardini, who have made a particular study of Spohr's writings on performance practice.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=BIS-2302&medium=phy#,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Romantic Era,Sweden,2018 BIS Records,2018 BIS Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These include works for traditional solo instruments – piano, violin, cello – but also more unusual ones, such as the theremin or accordion. One project of Aho's is to write concertos for all of the instruments of the symphony orchestra, from the flute to the contrabassoon, and in 2015 the turn came to the timpani. The work was commissioned by the Turku Philharmonic Orchestra for its timpanist Ari-Pekka Mäenpää, and Mäenpää and Aho worked closely together during the writing process. The result is a concerto that explores the instrument's full potential, from the melody opening the concerto, which lasts more than thirty bars, to the rhythmically compelling third movement. Composed almost 30 years earlier, Piano Concerto No. 1 reflects the composer's interest at the time in numerology, and specifically in so-called cyclic numbers. The colorful and exciting work is however anything but cerebral. The soloist is Sonja Fräki, who chose Aho's music for piano as the subject of her doctoral studies, and whose recording of the solo works was released to great acclaim in 2015.

After the performance of Bruckner’s Seventh, the famous conductor Hermann Levi had hailed him as ""the greatest symphonist since the death of Beethoven"". Frequently ridiculed in Vienna, Bruckner had finally been taken seriously in Munich: his importance had been recognized, and the Austrian emperor had awarded him the Order of Franz Joseph – something that filled Bruckner with very special pride. In the summer of 1884 he set to work on a new symphony, and in August 1887, after three years of work, the symphony was completed. Because of energetic objections from Levi, however, it was not immediately performed. Bruckner revised his work thoroughly between October 1887 and March 1890, and the premiere of the Eighth Symphony in its new version finally took place on December 18, 1892, performed by the Vienna Philharmonic under Hans Richter. It was an extraordinary success. Hugo Wolf described the concert as follows: ""It was an absolute victory of light over darkness, and the storm of delighted applause was like some elemental manifestation of nature. In short, it was a triumph as complete as any Roman emperor could have wished for."" Since then, Bruckner's Eighth Symphony has been an integral part of the symphonic repertoire, yet it still continues to present a huge challenge to performers. Mariss Jansons and the musicians of the Symphonieorchester des Bayerischen Rundfunks are however more than equal to the extraordinary demands made by this masterpiece. The recording of the Munich concert event of November 2017 has now been released by BR-KLASSIK: it is an exemplary performance of one of the most important compositions of the Late Romantic symphonic repertoire, in its version of 1890.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=BRK900165&medium=phy#,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Orchestral,Germany,2018 BRmedia Service GmbH,2018 BRmedia Service GmbH,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although Jadassohn was a distinguished teacher and wrote several important books on composition and music theory, he considered himself primarily a composer.

The piano Fantasiestucke op. 111 was composed in 1851 during  atime of deteriorating mental health and increasing disillusionment with his post as Music Director of the Dusseldorf Music Society. In contrast to the youthfully extroverted Fantasiestucke op. 12 of 1837, these three untitled pieces are “of a serious and passionate character,” as Clara described them. The Fantasie in C major op. 17 is one of Schumann’s most powerful large-scale piano works, composed during the bitter period of his enforced separation from Clara. Schumann completed his cycle of nine forest piano miniatures, Waldszenen, in 1849, while struggling with increasing bouts of mental instability and depression. Each piece is headed by a descriptive title. These masterly tone paintings display Schumann’s genius in creating miniature images consummate in expression, characterization and mood. Critics have praised Einav Yarden’s previous recordings for Challenge Classics: “She pairs Beethoven with Stravinsky to striking effect, merging that unlikely couple with imagination and exceptionally vivid playing.” (The Washington Post) “Yarden plays a wonderfully exuberant, vibrant Haydn, glowing, transparent, adventurous, at times intimately chamber-music-like, at times grand and orchestral.

It begins with the ever-popular trio in D by Faure, an exploration of the deformation of high and low sounds composed at the end of his life when beset by deafness. Neave’s accurate and balanced interpretations perfectly capture the complexity and tension of the piece which in late Faure comes abundantly from texture and movement. This is followed by Debussy’s early piano trio, performed with a bright and radiant approach that provides great moments of lightness and clarity.

For half a century, the Malta Philharmonic Orchestra has been Malta’s leading musical ensemble. The orchestra was founded in April 1868, when musicians from the defunct “C-in-C” orchestra of the Malta-based British Mediterranean Fleet regrouped as the Manoel Theatre Orchestra. It continued to serve as the theatre’s resident orchestra until September 1997, when it became an independent orchestra, taking up the name National Orchestra of Malta in the process.

The Piano Concerto op. 9, composed shortly prior to the symphony and in the same key of E flat major, has astonishingly little to do with Liszt and much to do with Brahms. Although the piano part is properly virtuosic and demands eminent talent on a thoroughly Lisztian level, the ambitiously designed work is actually more a symphony for piano and orchestra. The instrumentation of his symphony is in principle of classical character and often pleasurably sonorous and also shares a certain predilection for the oboe with its model, and he too combines Beethovian texture and its frequent shifts of tempo with romantic emotion.

Rosenmüller implements changing combinations of singers and richly imaginative motivic work, even in the instrumental parts, which are in part virtuosic in character. The works are divided into sections, and the composer usually creates larger interconnected structures in them by using recurring ritornellos and repeatedly returning to the first verse of the particular work. The text concerns David’s petition for divine assistance in the greatest distress. The psalm has a special significance in the Christian church because according to Luke the words from its sixth verse, “Into your hands I commend my spirit,” were among Christ’s last words on the cross.

Tenor Michael Slattery performs the song cycle brilliantly, and soprano Marnie Breckenridge interprets the epilogue to devastating effect.

Phil Mer has added a high dose of realism with his production. On the album there are moments to close your eyes and float in midair, as if to breathe a sigh of relief, between minimal touches of guitar or piano, as in ""Risalire,"" in ""Gray, black, white,"" ""Sometimes the case,"" ""Existence,"" ""Beyond the stars,"" ""Love is not hungry,"" as well as to get to discover the warm and earthly soul of the singer-songwriter from which comes a deep Mediterranean feel (see ""Escape,"" ""Hero,"" ""Unconditionally,"" ""Between a second""). Rita presents her songs in simple and true terms; her vocal timbre, delicate and crystalline, then acts as a natural amplifier for these concepts. In the ten tracks of this album, the protagonists are dreams, love songs and small personal revolutions, songs that tell stories and expose common pains, those that every person faces, revenge and admissions to oneself with a common thread that is called hope.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=DIGR39&medium=phy#,24 Pop,Pop,Pop,Italy,Digressione Music,Digressione Music,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A child prodigy, with his elder brother Jascha, a pianist, they toured Europe as the Spivakovsky Duo. At only 18, Spivakovsky was spotted by Wilhelm Furtwängler, and he became the youngest concertmaster of the Berlin Philharmonic. In 1940, Spivakovsky emigrated to the U.S and made his New York debut at Town Hall. Two years later he became concertmaster of the Cleveland Orchestra under Artur Rodzinski. Obviously he was one of the top violinists of the Twentieth Century. Since childhood, Spivakovsky had a special interest in the way Bach repertoire for solo violin should be played. Although most violinists arpeggiate chords, Spivakovsky had become convinced early on that this was not what Bach intended. Upon realizing that Bach wanted certain chords in his solo violin works played without arpeggiation, he wrote an article entitled ""Polyphony in Bach’s Works for solo Violin,"" published in 1967 in The Music Review, Vol. 28, No. 4., in which he provided the evidence for Bach’s preference. He later acquired a curved Vega Bach Bow from Knud Vestergaard, of Denmark, which enabled him to perform with increased ease, sonority and smoothness of tone. The New York Times, describing Spivakovsky's performance of the Bach on April 1, 1963, wrote: ""Tossy Spivakovsky demonstrated again his impressive artistry, and his use of the curved bow gave his performances unusual interest. ... The violinist's use of the curved bow had its most persuasive results in the great Chaconne."" This set contains a distinctive performance: Spivakovsky’s interpretation of the Bach Chaconne using the VEGA BACH-Bow had never been released or available on record until now. We are therefore pleased to present here a brilliant live broadcast by Radio Stockholm from 1969. His playing is simply magnificent and attests to Spivakovsky’s genius as a magical new dimension is added to Bach’s violin music.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=DHR-8025-8&medium=phy#,01 Classical,Classical,,Canada,DOREMI 2018,DOREMI 2018,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Alex has composed all of the music, with the exception of one jazz standard, “I Hear a Rhapsody.” The goal of this record was to capture the energy and spirit of live jazz music: exciting, unpredictable and daring. His quintet, comprised of Chris Edmondson on alto saxophone, Gentiane MG on piano, Levi Dover on bass and Louis-Vincent Hamel on drums, do justice to this objective in brilliant fashion, with each of their individual voices shining through while conserving a concise group sound. Alex Francoeur is a mainstay in Montreal’s jazz community. After graduating from Schulich’s jazz performance program in May 2017, Francoeur has continued to maintain a busy playing schedule. He writes of this release: “After spending seven straight years in music schools, I felt the need to document this exciting period of transition from a controlled academic environment to life as a freelance musician. While in school, I had the benefit of being able to write and perform music with truly exceptional young musicians, and this album not only encompasses that experience but it will also act as a stepping stone for the rest of my career. I've had the idea of a live recording for many years. Many of my favorite albums were recorded live… All of these records have a special energy to them, and I find it difficult to truly capture that feeling in a studio setting.”",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=FND151&medium=phy#,02 Jazz,Jazz,,Canada,Socan,Socan,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hindemith was the more inclusive artist while Hartmann more fully reflected the cultural concerns of his time; as conveyed by the contemporaneous but aesthetically very different pieces on this release. Composed in 1942 during his stay in the United States, Ludus Tonalis was first performed in 1943 in Chicago. It is one of the greatest solo piano works of the mid-20th century, exploring matters of technique, theory, inspiration, and communication. This masterpiece comprises all 12 major and/or minor keys and was intended to be the 20th century equivalent to J.S. Bach’s The WellTempered Clavier. Written just three years after Ludus Tonalis, Hartmann’s Piano Sonata [No.2] depicts the shuffling feet of 20,000 camp prisoners from Dachau whom Hartmann watched being marched away from the approaching Allies. The subtitle of Hartmann’s work, ‘27 April 1945’, is clarified by an epigraph the composer (in his own words) positioned at the head of the score: ‘On the 27th and 28th of April 1945 trudged an endless stream of Dachau prisoners of war past us … unending was the misery … unending was the sorrow’. This is made explicit by the (central) Lento, a ‘Marcia funebre’ that ranks with Hartmann’s finest utterances; its sombre and fatalistic tread – shot through with fanfare-like elements – reaching an impassioned climax before regaining its mood of numbed sorrow. Esther Walker is pianist who combines “virtuoso fire and musical temperament” with “lyrical sensibility” in an almost ideal way.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=FHR54&medium=phy#,01 Classical,Classical,,European Union,2018 First Hand Records Ltd,2018 First Hand Records Ltd,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In cooperation with the Pannonic Philharmonic Orchestra under the baton of Tibor Boganyi, Schmid now releases a recording of both violin concertos by Bela Bartok. Written in 1908, the first concerto Op. posth. Sz 36 remained lost due to his unfortunate admiration of, and the handing over of the manuscript to, a violinist until late after Bartoks death, and only was published in 1956. The violin concerto No. 2 Sz 112 was composed in 1937/38 and should become the last completed solo concerto before Bartok’s emigration to the United States. Here, the listener can from listening alone hardly tell that in addition to the typical “Hungarian” melodies, twelve-tone motives and even quarter tones can be found in the solo part. Bejamin Schmid is one of today’s most versatile violinists.

The composers of both countries unite the compositional trends of the century in special ways although they all honor the traditions and write tonal, melodic music. It is difficult to explain why, after the French and German repertoire, it was in the Czech lands where significant flute sonatas were composed. What is more, the Czech school of flute playing could not be considered definitive in the 20th century. These works were dedicated to French flautists; Rene´ Leroy, George Laurent and Jean-Pierre Rampal were the dedicatees. The geographical and cultural position of Bohemia facilitated the embrace of both French and German influence, uniting them with a distinctively Slavic character. Perhaps this was why, comparably to Russian music, Czech compositions, works by Dvorak, Smetana and Janacek, joined Western European mainstream music the soonest. This central location held an advantage for Czech music also in the 20th century.

We wanted to present the listener with a satisfying musical journey, as much through the formal variety as the expressive content of the pieces, full of contrasts that are to be found among different movements of the same piece, as well as among the five works on the recording. Rather than offering a historical overview of the programme, we would prefer to look briefly at our choice of title, Deep Light, and its various meanings. On the one hand, it aims to evoke the luminosity that lies in the depth of feeling, represented here by two major works of the German Romantic clarinet repertoire, the Grand Duo Concertant by Carl Maria von Weber and Robert Schumann’s Phantasiestücke. Emotionally profound in their darker, slower movements, these works also display an exalted brightness in their exuberant finales. On the other hand, however, the deep and the light are simply synonyms for the serious and the playful. Seen in this way, the two German works provide the weight on the album, while the three others fall more into the second category.

Argentine composer Carlos Guastavino proposes us in his Sonata for clarinet and piano a neoclassical atmosphere in the clear formal definition of his themes and in a certain harmonic freedom, yet he offers a more scholastic work, more solid and resounding that is already clearly evident from the beginning of the work. This release also includes a final perspective of the neoclassical conceptual model, offered by the Austrian composer and conductor Joseph Horovitz in his Sonatina for clarinet and piano composed in 1981. Sonata en re by Nino Rota, composed in 1945, comes to us to finally offer us a musical image brimming with Mediterranean light. Kindness, beauty, simplicity and pleasant repose merge into a piece of scholastic organization in which solid formal structures guarantee the listening and understanding of a fundamentally melodic discourse, always well-articulated. Sonata for clarinet and piano by Francis Poulenc brings tenderness to the album. The slow section of the first movement invades all who know the work but its beauty is not only collected there. A different world, despite the proximity in time is what Edison Denissow offers us in his Sonata for clarinet, composed in 1972.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=IBS62018&medium=phy#,01 Classical,Classical,,Spain,2018 IBS Artist,2018 IBS Artist,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Kaija Saariaho’s native Finland gained its independence in 1917, which was the same year and with almost the same historic circumstances that shattered the social foundations of Russia, Sofia Gubaidulina’s country of origin (although she was actually a Tatar), in that case resulting in the October Revolution of 1917. The third composer, Geghuni Chitchyan’s country is Armenia, which achieved its first period of modern independence in early 1918, also as a result of the dramatic events that shook that part of the world in 1917.

Brahms succeeds in his two “Sister Sonatas” to show the full sonority of the woodwind instrument while treating the piano as an accompaniment, but equal chamber music partner. Clarinet and piano always stay together – in support and in dialogue. The composition in all of these works can be experienced as a contribution to any understanding of expression and inter-musical relationships: this becomes clear on an inter-musical level of the composition and on an inter-humane level of the interpreters. It is especially this aspect which makes Brahms still experienceable in performance and interpretable today. In this ‘performativity’, the works experience their raison d’être; and in their performance, the intimate dialogue of friendship becomes reality. It is hard to find such a well-balanced and creative union between three artists, whose solo careers speak for themselves, but whose collaboration evoke the true essence of music-making. The most notable element perhaps, which brings Pablo Barragan, Juan P. Floristan, and Andrei Ionita together is their common vision of the communicational power of chamber music, its capacity to inspire and transform and its importance for their professional and personal development.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=IBS72018&medium=phy#,01 Classical,Classical,,Spain,2018 IBS Artist,2018 IBS Artist,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Federico Mompou described this way in his admission speech to the Royal Academy of Fine Arts of Saint George not only the profound significance of his work titled Silent Music, but also his essential values and the sensitive attitude of both interpreter and listener to submerge in the asceticism that its course proposes. A description which is in line with the author of the verses that stimulated so much sound beauty, the most illustrious of our mystics, Saint John of the Cross, who, in the Prologue to his The Spiritual Canticle, names the explicit music in his verses: silent, because it is calm and peaceful intelligence. Although each book of Mompou’s Silent Music is composed on different tempi, the work possesses a united structure; the configuration in four books only responds to its chronological order of composition and not to a formal organization previously designed. Luis Aracama is considered by critics to be one of the most outstanding and eclectic Spanish pianists of his generation. The versatile musician is founder and artistic director of the Festival of Contemporary Music of Ponferrada, and his interest in the music of our time has led him to premiere works of various modern composers, many of which have been written specifically for him.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=IBS92018&medium=phy#,01 Classical,Classical,,Spain,2018 IBS Artist,2018 IBS Artist,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mussorgsky’s piano and vocal music has seen dozens of different transcriptions and orchestrations throughout 130 years of its existence. Can a new reading of Pictures at an Exhibition come as a surprise, knowing that the suite was previously played on the organ, bayan and synthesizer, by jazz and rock outfits, and is primarily associated with the gorgeous sound of Ravel’s orchestration? Ilya Ioff, the author of the new transcription, is confident that the string arrangement significantly returns this music to the piano original that Ravel’s post-impressionistic transcription moved so far away from (the more so because Ravel was guided by the first edition of the Pictures prepared by Rimsky-Korsakov, which had some deviations from Mussorgsky’s original). “… As I tried to interpret the piano pattern as a ”native” string one, I unintentionally “rehabilitated” the Russianness of this great cycle by adding, on the one hand, more melodiousness coming from the nature of the string instruments, and, on the other, running away from the temptation of “coloring” the material with effects untypical for 19th century Russian music”, Ilya Ioff writes.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=MELCD1002520&medium=phy#,01 Classical,Classical,,Russia,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A more developed form was the polychord, which was fitted with several strings to allow for the simultaneous production of more than one note. The addition of keys to the instrument heralded the birth of the clavichord. With his knowledge of music history, Friedrich Gulda was of course aware that the clavichord was Bach’s favorite instrument alongside the organ and so it seemed fitting for him to perform Bach’s works on the clavichord.

This is to such an extent that we obtain, through the metamorphosis of sounds created by different modes, a complete uncertainty on the identity of the transmitting source. In that, the Catalan Giner reached beyond the Pyrenees and the century to Basque Ravel who understood “fooling the listener” by the complexity of his combination of timbres.

Choosing to include Prokofiev’s “Sonata for Solo Violin” amid compositions from six contemporary composers who collectively represent three decades of works is indicative of Lee’s ability to tease out the subtle nuances of every piece she performs. The three-movement suite moves from the simplicity of Moderato’s Classical sonata format through the more lyrically, introverted Andante Dolce to the clever finale, Con Brio. Similarly, her transit through Benjamin Ellin’s composition for solo violin, “Three States at Play,” is a nuanced journey through three movements, in which the more serene second movement is bookended by two outer movements that are quite rhythmically active. When performing duets with Locker, such as on Rain Worthington’s “Jilted Tango,” Lee’s violin seamlessly integrates with the piano to create an atmosphere both spirited and poignant, capturing the “push and pull in a dance of love” implied by its title. Another sort of dance entirely is captured on the duo’s performance of the vibrant and upbeat “Grand Tartanella.” Moonkyung Lee’s career includes numerous accolades, awards and scholarships including the Yale Chamber Music Celebration, and an NYU/Steinhardt Doctoral Fellowship for Doctoral Studies, of which she was the first ever classical string performer recipient.

2018,NVA,Navona,NV6164,896931004640,Claude Debussy ,Eliane Rodrigues: Reflets,Eliane Rodrigues,1,CD,11.69,17.99,"With two critically-lauded releases on Navona Records, pianist Eliane Rodrigues returns with Reflets, showcasing the pianist’s nuanced and thoughtful performances of fifteen works by Claude Debussy. While it might seem that child prodigies are commonplace in the world of classical music, only a few truly make a lasting impact, one that lives on long after those prodigies have passed well into their adulthoods. Mozart began to play piano at the age of three, Beethoven did so at seven and a half, and Georges Bizet did so before his tenth birthday. Pianist Eliane Rodrigues, who began composing at three, played her first recital at five and first performed with an orchestra when she was just six years of age, can certainly be counted among those prodigious musicians, as evidenced on her latest recording, Reflets. The album opens with “Suite Bergamasque,” one of Debussy’s most well-known piano suites. The dynamic contrasts in the moods of the suite’s four pieces are well suited to Rodrigues’ sensitive and vivid style. Debussy is credited as one of the ‘founders’ of Impressionist music, distinguished by its focus on suggestions and atmosphere, a world that Rodrigues also inhabits here, as evidenced by her cascading and powerfully textured performance of Debussy’s “Ballade.” “Pour le Piano,” certainly one of the composer’s most moving works for solo piano, features rapid, brilliant passages that fully emphasize the pianist’s virtuosity. That impressionistic ability to invoke a mood or a feeling carries on with “First Arabesque in E Major,” one of a pair composed early in Debussy’s career. “Images,” comprised of two ‘books’ of three pieces each, ranging from the subdued “Homage à Rameau” to the energy of “Mouvement,” marked by the torrent of notes in its finale. Eliane Rodrigues was born in Rio de Janiero, where the performances that she gave in her childhood bore fruit when she was awarded the Gina Bachauer prize at the Van Cliburn Competition in the United States at only 18 years of age. She has gone on to perform internationally, as well as to hold the position of professor at the Royal Conservatoire in Antwerp.",https://youtu.be/uSl_KmCLhRs,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=NV6164&medium=phy#,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Piano,,,2018 Navona Records LLC,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, on his recording debut, he offers up 10 compositions, all of which emphasize his proficiency in both vocal and instrumental music. The opening track, Violin Dialogues I and II, presents violin and piano in conversation. The first Dialogue contrasts two sets of ideas, each instrument’s individual voice rising and falling until the two come together in a hard-won consensus. If Dialogue I is oppositional, Dialogue II is conversational, its narrative more about two characters who agree on the destination and differ only on the best way to reach it. The album’s title track, borrowed from the poem “Song” by Seamus Heaney is by turns lyrical and passionate, intimate and robust, as the five performers’ instruments weave their way through various combinations. The four movements of For the earth is hollow and I have touched the sky, is a musical response to a concert which the composer attended at the American Composers Orchestra of music by Frank Zappa. An even more pop-cultural reference is the composition’s title track and fourth movement, which is a musical representation of a quote from an episode of Star Trek, originally “…for the world is hollow and I have touched the sky.” The album’s first track to feature solo voice is My dove, my covey, an early lyrical poem by W.H. Auden, performed by a trio of oboe, violoncello and piano. In similar fashion, The heart has narrow banks, a beautiful poem written by Emily Dickenson, was chosen by the composer because it allowed him to create a more flexible harmonic language that could express lyrics such as “blue monotony” and “a wall of unattempted gauze” while keeping a consistent musical thread throughout. Inspired by a visit to New Mexico, Abiquiu Trio displays the impact of the desert landscape and the work of Georgia O’Keeffe on Andrews. The language of all three movements is a response to different facets of those two influences. The music of the piece’s final movement, begun during a short stay at Christ in the Desert, a living monastery where church services are intoned to Gregorian chants, is a strong reminder that in addition to his more secular work, Andrews is also noted for his compositions of church music.",https://youtu.be/CFtfOjpbDeA,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=NV6163&medium=phy#,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Chamber Music,,,2018 Navona Records LLC,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Her travels around the globe have led her to incorporate non-Western instruments and musical practices into several of her compositions as well as to find inspiration trekking through Peru, or by exploring the remote and desolate areas of the American West. On Chamber Works, her debut on Navona Records, Houghton incorporates these influences along with many others to deliver eight stunning performances showcased in a variety of musical configurations. Chamber Works opens with “Andean Suite,” a four-movement piece, that gleans its inspiration from Houghton’s journey on foot through the mountains of Peru. The sense of freedom exhibited by the opening movement, “With the Condors,” is buoyed by the closing movement, “Dance,” which employs folk music idioms of the Andes to express pure joy. “The Twelve Causes from the Circle of Becoming” reflects the essence of Tibetan Buddhist Wheel of Life paintings. In the spirit of those paintings pianist James Winn delivers an intricate and powerful performance. The Argenta Trio brings the three movements of “Wilderness Portraits: Three Places in Nevada,” capturing Houghton’s quiet sense of awe at the beauty of the natural world. Three of the album’s pieces, “Three Songs without Words,” and “Stay Shadow,” and “Corpo Sonoro,” gather inspiration from poets as disparate in place and time as New Spain’s Sor Juana Inez de la Cruz, who worked in the mid-17th century and the Tang Dynasty poet Tu Fu. The four poetic pieces in “Corpo Sonoro” are here performed by pianist Halida Danova, for whom it was composed, and are based on poems by the Brazilian poet Maria Davico. Turning her creative gaze on Beethoven, Houghton composed “Epigram,” performed by the Cleveland Chamber Collective, in response to his last quartet. The album concludes with the floating, mysterious “Sky Signs” which is, the composer says, a fantasy inspired by the fluctuating changes so common in the natural world.",https://youtu.be/XWkoZGsGrK8,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=NV6162&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Contemporary Era,,,2018 Navona Records LLC,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2018,NVA,Navona,NV6159,896931004596,J.S. Bach ,Thomas Bowes: Sei Solo,Thomas Bowes,3,CD,11.69,17.99,"Thomas Bowes' Sei Solo shines the spotlight on the sonatas and partitas for solo violin composed by Johann Sebastian Bach in 1720. Bowes believes that these six stand-alone compositions, while each individually offering insight into Bach's genius reveal more when taken as one epic work - and especially when set against the tragedy in Bach’s life in the year of composition. The three albums in Bowes’ release contain a total of six tracks. Each album starts with a sonata and concludes with a partita, moving through different keys. The sonatas showcase a larger, more abstract expression, while movements in the partitas are more focused on elements of the dance. Bowes views these six compositions as a vehicle for exploration into the existential, taking his cue from Bach’s cryptic title ‘sei solo’, which reads ‘you are alone’, punning on the Italian for ‘6’ and ‘you are’. Though the performer flies solo on all of the tracks, he reaches well beyond the limitations of just one instrument. The focus and attention the violinist brings to all six tracks draws the listener into a meditative state of mind. It’s almost as if Bowes is performing solely for each individual listener, providing an intimate experience that demands attention yet allows room for contemplation.",https://youtu.be/-0mU7KGRGZk,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=NV6159&medium=phy#,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Violin,,,2018 Navona Records LLC,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By comparing and contrasting present triumphs with past regrets, the composers on this album develop a compelling, philosophical reflection of the world we live in. Conducted by Petr Vronský, the Moravian Philharmonic Orchestra delivers a master class in cohesiveness while tackling a wildly diverse, yet wholly complete set of compositions. The album starts strong with Christopher Keyes’ An Inescapable Entanglement. Keyes binds minimalist elements with late 16th and early 17th century forms of concerto to create a controlled chaos of instruments and voices playing distinct parts simultaneously. In his intent to create an antiphonal sound, Keyes employs eight loudspeakers to project the music achieving a thickened, full texture. Red Rock is a symphonic poem commissioned by the Henderson Symphony and its music director, Taras Krysa. The music is based on the interaction of two musical materials, the first, calm and diatonic, presented by the French horns after the introduction and elaborated by the trumpets and the woodwinds; and the second, more angular and chromatic, also introduced by a solo French horn in the second section. Similar to a sonata form, these materials go through transformations and developments in the middle section, and return evolved and reconciled at the end of the movement. The piece suggests a gliding trip over the stunning landscape of the Red Rock canyon, with its sharp geological contrasts, its ever changing shapes, and its surprising colors. Fernidnando De Sena’s Deciphered Reverence explores the idea of divine presence and creates an interpretation through the consistent, triumphant swelling of the orchestra. De Sena’s piece captures the many moods, modes, and colors in the music to translate his vision of life and celebrate its ambiguity and omnipresence. Composed by Willem Van Twillert, multiple styles set the foundation for Branches of Singularity. Multiple developments transitions from one style to another create an enticing and evolving piece. Andrew Schultz’ Symphony No. 2 – Ghosts of Reason ties the whole album together. Slowing the pace of the otherwise energetic album, Schultz’s composition paints a haunting atmosphere by drawing out the wistful bleakness of its wandering melodies.",https://youtu.be/5_A694nc9MU,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=NV6166&medium=phy#,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Orchestral,,,2018 Navona Records LLC,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Versatile and prolific, he contributed music for films, the theatre, the 1964 Tokyo Olympics and broadcasts. His enthusiasm for avant-garde Western music led him to study in Paris, and the Phonologie Symphonique is a synthesis of Varese-like acoustical experiment and serial techniques. The jazz-tinted Bacchanale is Mayuzumi’s attempt to produce ‘a cosmos of sounds reflecting the vital energies of the origin of music,’ and the symphonic poem Samsara is a musical expression of Buddhist teaching, an attempt to escape the seemingly endless cycle of birth and rebirth. This recording first appeared in 1984 on the Marco Polo label.

A study in dramatic contrasts, Carl Ruggles’ ‘Sun-Treader’ is an overwhelming, granite-hued tone poem by one of New England’s most original and uncompromising composers. Steven Stucky’s luminous Pulitzer Prize-winning ‘Second Concerto for Orchestra’ is a riveting exploration of sonority and sound-painting while John Harbison’s ‘Fourth Symphony’ is a big, bold, jazz-imbued work by one of America’s most important living symphonists. These three American orchestral masterpieces comprise a program that will impress and delight in equal measure. Grammy Award-winning conductor David Alan Miller has established a reputation as one of the leading American conductors of his generation. His work with the National Orchestral Institute Philharmonic has resulted in several critically-acclaimed recordings. “Conductor David Alan Miller’s tempos are broad, letting the music breathe and allowing the composer’s clear textures and melodic warmth to be fully revealed.

Coates’s ‘Symphony No. 10’ evokes the archaeological ruins of a Celtic tribe, inspiring a torrent of dramatic percussion and long held tones that curve and shake in a moving body of sound. Gloria Coates is the most prolific female symphonist in musical history, and Naxos has an emerging series of her symphonic, chamber and other major works. Of her Symphony No. 15, released on a previous Naxos recording, Fanfare wrote: “the new symphony is still a jaw-dropper.” In general, the symphonies on Naxos come attached to other larger-scaled works and the chamber music (predominantly quartets) is programmed together.

When beautiful Clarissa Harlowe is forced to marry the rich but repulsive Mr. Solmes, she refuses, much to her family’s chagrin. She escapes their persecution with the help of Mr. Lovelace, a dashing and seductive rake, but soon finds herself in a far worse dilemma. Lovelace is a devil in disguise: he promptly imprisons Clarissa, and is determined to break her will. Terrifying and enlightening, Clarissa weaves a tapestry of narrative experimentation into a gripping morality tale of good triumphing over evil. The recording is divided into three volumes, the present release being the first. Clarissa is one of the longest novels in the English canon; many critics agree that it is one of the greatest and most influential in English.

Delighted, Maggie then reciprocates by choosing a partner for her widower father: childhood friend Charlotte Stant. The stage is set, and what unfolds is a deep and gripping exploration of fidelity and the politics of love and marriage.

And the target of this savagery: Justine de Bertole, a pious and virginal heroine. While her amoral sister Juliette gets all the wonders in the world, virtuous and faithful Justine is subjected to punishment after punishment at the hands of sadistic and abusive deviants. Grotesque, inhumane and compelling, Sade’s novel overturns Rousseau’s views of the social contract, and the common trope that punishment only visits sinners, to deliver a passionate treatise on good and evil, virtue and sin. Justine is infamous for its controversial content and themes. There continues to be much fascination with Sade among scholars and writers, and many film adaptations have been made of his work, including Pasolini’s 1975 film ‘Salo.’ This is the first unabridged recording.

Boyce opens the program in a haze with the murky intersection of ‘102nd & Amsterdam.’ His Piano Quartet No. 1 begins with Bartokian off-kilter accents, alternating with hocketed passages between viola and piano. Finally ‘Fortuitous Variations’ opens with similarly angular music, pillars of repeated octaves in the piano alternating with swooping gestures in the strings.

Bach before him. The music of Brahms is intimately connected to and rooted in the German-Austrian tradition that he inherited. For Brahms, this tradition was very much alive and relevant; he constantly measured his own efforts against the achievements of Bach, Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven, trying to live up to and continue their legacy. He was not looking back to the past, but “progressing” (to use the terminology of Schoenberg’s essay “Brahms the Progressive”) towards a past that was yet to be fulfilled. There is a precious sense of inevitability in great art, as if every masterpiece was meant to be created exactly as it is. The works of Brahms are amazingly organic, meticulously calculated and very human at the same time. This fusion of intellect and feeling, sincerity and reserve, heartfelt emotion and impeccable taste is unique to Brahms. It makes his music inevitable and indispensable. Pianist and conductor Vladimir Feltsman is one of the most versatile and constantly interesting musicians of our time.

In place of gilded drawing rooms were smoky dives and rather than offering a venue for artistic transcendence, it offered shaky boards on upturned crates or beer barrels. These boards, in German “Brette” were further parodied in the diminutive as “Brettel” – or “little boards”, offering a name to the songs performed on such makeshift stages. It soon became fashionable for urban bohemians to frequent such low-life dives bringing a certain gentrification in their wake. In Berlin, Paris, Vienna and Barcelona, the bawdy songs that would have been more typical of English sea-side music halls were replaced by social satire, often pulling heavy political punches. Yet if there’s a single difficulty about Cabaret, it would be its inability to transcend locality, time and place. Cabaret like operetta, is essentially local, and rarely even survives into the following week or year. Its pre-war material was the equivalent of the satirical television programs of today – enormously entertaining while being “to the minute” relevant, making references to issues or people everyone recognized. Less entertaining is returning to the same material a year or a decade later. Events, politicians and social mores have moved on. Yet some elements survived either because the music and text were timeless in themselves, or emerged decades – or indeed, a century later, as provocatively contemporary. Struggles for social justice such as “Me Too” or “Black Lives Matter” are embryonically echoed in songs such as “Chuck all of the Men out of the Reichstag” or “Das Lila Lied”. Even today, we return to music to poke fun at society while making serious political points as a viable tool of passive resistance. True geniuses such as Hollaender, Spoliansky, Heymann and yes, Hughes & Limb could move the genre beyond supporting amusing texts with four-square accompaniments to true musical brilliance.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=NI6367&medium=phy#,02 Jazz,Jazz,Jazz|Vocal Jazz,United Kingdom,2018 Wyastone Estate Limited,2018 Wyastone Estate Limited,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bagpipes throughout France are so diverse that a territorial situating of them is in itself a means of distinguishing between immensely different musical instruments. The distinction is all the more important to make since the bouhe, the bounloure, bouhaussac, or tchalemine with the many names it goes by in local dialect, nowadays called in French a “corenmuse landaise,” is in itself a whole brance of organology distinct from other traditional French bagpipes. But what is curious, is to find this organology present in certain Central European countries. Did it spread there? Or was it the result of a parallel evolution? In the case of the “cornemuse landaise,” the world is one of shepherds isolated deep in the moorlands, in “a magnificent desert which enchanted our ancestors, unfolding its primeval nudity beneath a barren sky in a straight, limitless expanse where the eye is perpetually dazzled by the nothingness and the soul enlarged, intoxicated, brimming with novel, childish joys which lose themselves in ineffable, tender moments of sadness.” Thus wrote Felix Arnaudin in 1912.

The album opens with the three-act opera Die Feen (The Fairies). Die Feen was Wagner’s first completed opera, but was never performed in the composer’s lifetime. It has never established itself in the operatic repertoire, although it occasionally receives performances in Germany. The music shows the influences of Carl Maria von Weber, while at the same time alludes to the future compositions of Wagner’s maturity. Next is Das Liebesverbot (The Ban on Love). This early opera is a two act comic opera with the libretto taken after Shakespeare’s Measure for Measure. The premiere was a grand failure, and it was never performed again during the composer’s lifetime. The themes of the opera, however, are themes that recur throughout Wagner’s output- namely restrained sexuality versus eroticism. The final inclusion on this release is Rienzi.

The works were arranged by Frans Brüggen (1934–2014), famous Dutch recorder player and conductor who was of the greatest importance to the movement of the historically informed performance practice. With the exception of his Partita BWV 1013, Bach wrote relatively few works for the recorder. However, composers like Bach and Vivaldi did themselves arrange many of their works for different instruments. From this point of view the work of arranging Bach’s solo cello and violin pieces for recorder is something what Bach himself could have done, had he been inspired by a talented recorder player himself at the time of his compositions. For this recording several different recorders were being chosen. For the 11 movements written for the violin original keys were kept by changing the recorders accordingly. The cello suites are being played by one recorder only by transposing the original keys down a minor second.

In his Lobgesang, Mendelssohn achieved nothing less than the artistic destruction of the conceptual opposition of vocal and instrumental music. Here they enter into a relationship of constructive, mutual support in the service of music. Moreover, the Biblical lyrics express Mendelssohn’s deeply-felt religiosity.

One has to constantly keep those currents of optimism and pessimism in balance. For that, you need to have access to an orchestra’s full sound spectrum in a highly flexible, dynamic manner.

This series of recordings includes one of the three instrumental pieces from the operas of Richard Wagner (1813-1883) as well as an astonishingly urgent, brisk reading of Anton Bruckner’s Eighth Symphony. Listening to the grandiose Poème de l’Exstase by Alexander Skryabin (1872-1915) conducted by this precision fanatic, it is easy to imagine that one is hearing details and structures that other conductors may allow to be absorbed into the overall sound. The inner-Soviet renaissance of the Skryabin contemporary and late Romantic melodist Vasily Kalinnikov (1866-1901) received decisive impetus from Mravinsky – not least thanks to his energetic reading of the composer’s Second Symphony.

Duke Ellington’s sacred concerts had many incarnations, more than the three on the commercial records: The First (1965), The Second (1968) and The Third (1973). At concerts Ellington often made changes in the proceedings – left out some numbers, and played others, and altered the succession of numbers played. This was evidenced at Coventry Cathedral on a winter’s Monday, February 21st 1966. The Coventry concert had its centerpiece in “In The Beginning God”, but apart from that it was no ordinary sacred concert: Two numbers, “Come Sunday” and “Tell Me It’s The Truth” would have a vocal on the issued record and in other performances of A Concert of Sacred Music the previous year, but were purely instrumental here – and the two numbers following “In The Beginning God” had no connection to a religious theme. With him on that day in Coventry Cathedral were some highly professional British vocalists, The Cliff Adams Singers and the baritone singer George Webb, giving the performance a special quality, which the band acknowledged by playing on the top of their game. The concert was filmed for TV, and part of it was telecast. Two numbers were regrettably omitted from the TV production, but are on this album, a powerful version of “Light (Montage)” from Black, Brown And Beige, and the above-mentioned “Come Sunday.” The concert also includes a premiere and only performance of a new Ellington composition “Come Easter,” a premiere of another new Ellington piece “West Indian Pancake,” and one of the first performances of a piece which would become an important part of many concerts during the following years, “La Plus Belle Africaine.”",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=SVL1018448&medium=phy#,02 Jazz,Jazz,Jazz|Big Band,,2018 Storyville Records,2018 Storyville Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The album contains fascinating and little known works by Alexandre Tansmann. Lucia Huang and Sebastian Euler became acquainted while studying at the Munich Academy of Music under Karl-Hermann Mrongovius and Begona Uriarte. At the end of 1999 they established Duo d’Accord. During the following two years they won the second prize in the ARD competition in Germany and first prize in the Murray Dranoff competition in the USA, these competitions being the most renowned in the world for piano duos. Thus began a career which has seen Duo d’Accord celebrated as a piano alliance of extraordinary quality. Their programmes have become their trademark: an unusual combination of masterpieces, rarities, own arrangements and new music. Not only their exciting concerts but also their recordings rest on the delight they take in all this musical wealth.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=SWR19053CD&medium=phy#,01 Classical,Classical,,Germany,2017 SWR Media Services GmbH,2018 Naxos Deutschland GmbH,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Don Francesco Gonzaga Prencipe di Mantova, et si Monferrato.” These are 18 compositions selected and edited by Giulio Cesare Monteverdi: 17 “Scherzi,” strophic songs written by Claudio, except for the last two by Giulio Cesare himself, and a wider concluding ballet, “De la bellezza le dovute lodi.” Even with light and schematic compositions such as “Scherzi,” the rules of the “Seconda Prattica” do not fail: new polyphonic technique, innovative use of dissonance, original concertation and, above all, great importance to the lyrics, with a strong dramatic power, before harmony and rhythm. The set is a masterpiece of the history of music of that time, in the mark of eternal quarrel between ancient and modern. The EsaEnsemble, a female vocal group directed by Sergio Chierici and accompanied by the instrumental ensemble Baschenis, effectively deals with this important work by the great genius of the Renaissance, in a colorful variety of vocal and instrumental organics supported by a wide use of period instruments.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=TC561309&medium=phy#,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Renaissance,Austria,2018 Tactus Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He chose Italy as his adopted country: there he was nicknamed “the dear Saxon”. He was a pupil of Nicola Porpor and Alessandro Scarlatti, from whom he learned the typical composition style of the Neapolitan School. In 1727 he was appointed Kapellmeister of the Conservatorio degli Incurabili of Venice, the city in which he met his bride, Faustina Bordoni. He was engaged as a composer by the Polish court, for which he composed a great number of operas that were staged in Dresden and in other European countries, particularly Italy. The arias presented here by Elena De Simone belong to the genre of the opera seria and have been chosen among the most representative ones in Hasse’s unpublished production, which is based on texts – most of them by Metastasio and Apostolo Zeno – that were a great source of inspiration for the major European musicians of that time.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=TC690801&medium=phy#,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Cantata,Austria,2018 Tactus Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On the other hand, the composers’ wish is to be understood, welcomed, and anticipated, especially in those precious moments preceding the applause at the end of a performance. So, this time, let’s try: let’s try to go deep inside, going back from the composer’s pen to his mind. Let’s go back that meter of route from the mouth of the hand to the source of creativity, and let’s try to understand the inspiration, the intuitions, and also the emotions that light up Paolo Cavallone’s mind. It is possible to do this with his music, because his scores show a vitality condensed in the form of a poetic language, even in the abstraction of his musical thought.

Seven of the first eight songs are his originals. Those are not merely quick melodies and chord changes that serve as the foundation for long solos.

The emphasis is on thoughtful playing, close group interplay, concise and meaningful statements, and a lyrical ballad feel even during the more heated sections.” (Jazz critic Scott Yanow) A 2014 Summa Cum Laude graduate of the prestigious University of North Texas Jazz Studies program, Frei currently holds the piano chair in the Juilliard Artist Diploma Ensemble, regularly performing and touring with the conservatory’s flagship jazz ensemble.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=TCB%2035502&medium=phy#,02 Jazz,Jazz,,Austria,2018 TCB Music SA,2018 TCB Music SA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One could interpret this title as a motto from the career of Peter Eingemann, which is now nearly four decades long. It requires perseverance, over such a pronounced timespan, to continualy develop one’s craft- especially in the winds of our fast-moving times. A guitarist with passion and careful sensibility presents us with a new Trio that includes Patrick Sommer on bass and Dominic Egli on drums. This collaboration began with the founding of the Peter Eigenmann/Ken Cervenka Nonet and was, as Eigenmann describes it, “A stroke of luck.” As the well known story goes- “You can be really happy if you find a good bass player and a good drummer- but even more so, when they make a good rhythm section. And, without a doubt, these two are great together.” In addition, they also get enough room to show off their skills as outstanding soloists. While playing the many favorites from Peter Eigenmann’s repertoire, a silent consensus emerged within the group- the desire to interpret each tune with the utmost freedom and expression. The spectrum of music is varies, ranging from open improvisation to through-composed material. The common denominator of this project: An open ear for one another and the blending of each individual’s personal sound. Together, the three achieve a beautifully balanced musical statement.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=TCB%2035602&medium=phy#,02 Jazz,Jazz,,Austria,2018 TCB Music SA,2018 TCB Music SA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Yet it is an important link between the Baroque and Classical worlds of eighteenth-century France and the emerging Romanticism of the nineteenth. This recording, on an Erard piano from 1853, highlights both its Classical poise and its Romantic charm. It reveals Boely as a forerunner of composers like Saint-Saens, whom he taught, as well as other piano pioneers such as Alkan, Chopin and Liszt, all of whom this prominent Parisian musician and teacher may well have known personally. Stephanie McCallum is Associate Professor in piano at the Sydney Conservatorium of Music of the University of Sydney, where she herself studied with Alexander Sverjensky and with the noted Liszt player, Gordon Watson. After advanced studies in England with the Alkan authority Ronald Smith, she made her Wigmore Hall debut in 1982. She has appeared extensively as a soloist in Australia, France and the United Kingdom.

It is also the largest body of works in Estonian classical music. But most of these pieces are unknown, even though the best of them are original contributions to the piano repertoire of the twentieth century, with Eller’s sensitive lyricism underpinned by gentle humor and an occasional epic tone. Volume Six in this series of nine recordings brings over half a century of music, from 1910 to 1965. It includes the melodious Sonatina in G minor, the spirited ‘Piano Music in Folk Tone’ and the exquisite ‘La fille du nord.’ Sten Lassmann is one of the leading Estonian pianists of his generation. He appears frequently as a soloist and chamber musician, performing in some of the most prestigious venues, such as the Glenn Gould Studio in Toronto, Purcell Room in London, the Large and Small Halls of the Tchaikovsky Conservatoire in Moscow, the Giuseppe Verdi Conservatoire Concert Hall in Milan and the Forbidden City Concert Hall in Beijing. He has been playing and recording Heino Eller’s piano works since 2008 and in 2018 recorded the final, ninth volume.

As these first recordings of his four string quartets reveal, he is not only the link between the Bohemian composers of the end of the Classical period and the wave of Czech Romanticism that began with Smetana- he is also an outstanding composer in his own right. His four quartets trace the stylistic evolution of his time: they emerge from a debt to Haydn, Beethoven and Spohr and embrace Mendelssohn and Schumann on their way to pre-echoes of Smetana and Dvorak. A review of Volume One in this series stated: “This period-instrument quartet has a wonderfully rich, warm ensemble sound. I am very much looking forward to volume two.” At last, here it is. The Kertesz Quartet was formed in 2010 by four leading period instrument specialists following a desire to explore chamber music of the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries and, using historical instruments, bring it to audiences. The Quartet combines traditions of the central European and historic, period performance practices. Using gut strings and historic bows, the original sound world, liveliness and intensity of the music is revived in fresh performances that are relevant today.

At least the title of Walter Zimmermann’s trio is based on a poem by Robert Creeley, but the words are not heard in the piece. Also, the audience does not need to be aware of the Baroque verse structures upon which Andreas Dohmen based his work commissioned by the group. The title “Songs and Poems” nevertheless points in a certain direction. It reflects an underlying longing in these instrumental pieces for language, voice, and song, for the authenticity of singing, the simplicity of song, and the hidden meanings of poetry. Perhaps “Songs and Poems” is a song collection that only dreams of songs, just as the Trio Accanto – with its unusual instrumentation of saxophone, percussion, and piano – is a jazz trio that does not play jazz.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=WER73642&medium=phy#,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Chamber Music,Austria,2018 Wergo,2018 Wergo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
