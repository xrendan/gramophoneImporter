However, he also wrote a considerable amount of music for string ensemble, including a set of 12 chamber sonatas subtitled Fidicinium Sacro-Profanum which was first published in Nuremberg in 1683. The title refers to the fact that the music in the sonatas combine sacred and secular styles. In his collection, Biber set new standards in the field of string chamber music. In the first part he composes for a five-part string ensemble: 2 violins, 2 violas, violone and basso continuo, a combination that was established at his time as the standard ensemble in Austrian cultural circles. In a richly colored setting, Biber artfully weaves a polyphonic texture that allows the voices to alternate and come to the fore. In the second part of this collection he dispenses with the five-part arrangement hitherto predominant in Austria, and focuses on augmenting the flexibility of the four individual parts. The present recording of Biber’s twelve chamber sonatas Fidicinium Sacro-Profanum is performed by Harmonie Universelle under its director Florian Deuter.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=ACC%2024357&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Netherlands,2019 Accent,2019 Accent,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The musicianship presented here is singular, sung by two volunteer choirs with power and emotion. The inspired arrangements heard on this recording have developed over decades of working with wonderful choirs and congregations, as well as by singing with, and listening to, many inspired colleagues. Some of the descants were conceived for particular services, while other arrangements grew further for special occasions. Several of the brass arrangements were composed for the ordination and consecration of the Rt. Rev. Alan Gates as Bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Massachusetts in 2014. Australians Michael S. Murray and Stuart Forster have worked together for more than 20 years, including conducting and accompanying in one another’s Episcopal churches, Christ Church in Cambridge and Church of the Redeemer in Chestnut Hill, located on opposite sides of the river Charles in Boston, Massachusetts, and during choir tours throughout America and Europe. Waiting and planning for the right moment to share their combined parish traditions of engaged singing from the vast legacy of hymnody bestowed upon the Anglican tradition has been fulfilled in this album. The installation of the exquisite Schoenstein organ at Church of the Redeemer, the restoration of the acoustic in Henry Vaughan’s exquisite architecture, and the publication of some of Stuart Forster’s hymn arrangements made the timing just right. What you will hear on this album is a superlative combined choir of about eighty voices singing some of the best-known hymns accompanied by a newly designed organ as they’ve never been heard before.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=AF1901&medium=phy,Christian & Gospel,Christian & Gospel|Classic Christian,Classical|Sacred,United States,2019 Affeto Records,2019 Affetto Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mark Padmore (tenor) joins them to record Four Hymns for Tenor, Viola and Piano. Ralph Vaughan Williams learned the piano and violin from an early age, but took to the viola while still at school and continued to play it all his life; this instrument is associated with his most romantic and impassioned music. His contemporary, the great viola virtuoso Lionel Tertis, was the inspiration for two of the works presented here. The Suite for Viola and Small Orchestra was premiered by Tertis in 1934, soon followed by a viola and piano edition. The eight movements of this lively work mainly represent dances. The short but lovely Romance is thought to have been written for Lionel Tertis at approximately the time of the First World War. It was apparently never performed and was found after the composer’s death. The Six Studies in English Folk Song, dedicated in 1926 to the cellist May Mukle, were produced in alternative versions for cello, viola, violin and clarinet, all with piano. Folk songs were important to Vaughan Williams, who collected many of them, and this work is based on six of them. This work in turn led on to a Fantasia on Sussex Folk Tunes for cello and orchestra, dedicated in 1929 to Pablo Casalls. John Lenehan published a piano reduction of the piano part and Martin Outram has adapted the cello solo part for the viola. The Fantasia on Greensleeves derives from VW’s 1928 opera, Sir John in Love. Based on a well-known tune, possibly of the Tudor period, at incorporates another folk song, Lovely Joan. The Four Hymns for Tenor, Viola and Piano date from just before the first works war. Based on texts dating from the 17th to the 20th century, they are weighty in mood and rise to feelings of religious ecstasy.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ5HpdvQ6uw,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=ALBCD036&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Chamber Music,United Kingdom,2019 ALBION RECORDS,2019 ALBION RECORDS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hevreh Ensemble is internationally acclaimed for its live performances, which feature a wide array of instruments from Cherokee Native American flute, English horn, and shofar to world percussion including djembe, dumbek, balafon, rain stick, and tabla. The Ensemble is also joined on A PATH OF LIGHT by some extraordinary guests, including the genre-defying string quartet ETHEL, cross-cultural percussionist Shane Shanahan, George Rush on double bass, and Naren Budhkar on tabla. The essence of the music on the album, which includes ten compositions written by Adler, revolves around two tracks: A Path of Light and The Speed of Dark, each of which follows a distinctively diverse path. The title track, A Path of Light, features a quiet, meditative introduction which builds to a joyous and frenzied conclusion. That positive energy is balanced, according to Adler, by “the thickness and occasional dissonance of the writing in The Speed of Dark, which invokes feelings of fear and intolerance.” The piece that follows The Speed of Dark and which closes the album is the somber-toned Epilogue, which musically represents the consequences of following that second path. A PATH OF LIGHT surrounds these anchoring compositions with seven pieces that together weave a rich tapestry of textures and tones. From the adventurous Sima de los Huesos, to the jazz-centric Sweetgrass Cedar and Sage, to the propulsive Amor Caritas, Hevreh’s performances serve to emphasize both the exceptional contributions of each individual instrument as well as the melodic intricacy of their interplay.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uy89VksrQIQ&feature=youtu.be,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=AR0013&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,World|North America,,,2018 Ansonica Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although born in Buenos Aires, it was Germany that Guillermo heard tango for the first time in his life. It was the orchestra of Leopoldo Federico with Julio Sosa as a singer. He was eleven years old then, and it took eleven more years before he started learning the bandoneon, which he took up in 1992, studying with Enrique Fasuolo.

The reference to the eyes from literary topos becomes in many Landini’s texts a melancholic poetic expedient to express the distance, the absence or the loss of the beloved woman, that only “the heart’s eye” (L’Occhio del Cor) is able to imagine.

Karen Vourc’h, Thomas Savy, Louis Rodde and Guillaume de Chassy enjoyed navigating between the waters of the Lied and the Jazz Standard to produce this outstanding project connecting two geniuses of melody with intelligent arrangements and improvisational extravagance. And, as ever, hidden behind the old stones, a B Records microphone is there to let you share in this musical journey. Louis Rodde writes of the significance of this album: “We simply asked ourselves the following question: “What can the 21st century musician do to examine our collective musical memory?” When it comes down to it, Schubert and Ellington are two musical pasts, as are Bach and Schumann after all. It was all about us leading people into different worlds, as in a big museum…Everyone is free to make their own connections.”",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=LBM019&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Lithuania,2019 B Records,2019 B Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This exciting instrument is often reduced to the stereotype squeeze box employed by itinerant musicians to play old favorites on crowded streets, or the frequently derided oompapa music of Alpine legend. Nikola Djoric is not an artist who wants to shatter such preconceptions. He has no need to do that; it happens quite automatically. The world lies in his hands, as it were, whenever he straps the instrument with its host of buttons to his chest. The two buttonboards on each side have a similar range to that of a piano. By using a swaying movement of the bellows the tone can be varied much as it can on the cello. This is augmented by the metal reeds set in motion by the circulation of air from the bellows and the various registers for bass and treble. Nikola Djoric is fascinated by the fact that the accordion combines the characteristics of keyboard, string and wind instruments. A fact which he exploits to paint the tonal pictures of his performance programmes. He has dedicated his debut album for Berlin Classics to two of the great Russian masters: Modest Mussorgsky and Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky. His approach is very simple. ""I play exactly what is in the original score."" No arrangements, just everything as Mussorgsky and Tchaikovsky wrote it. It is this interplay – original score played on a new instrument – that informs Nikola Djoric's performance and which astounds the purists and experimenters alike. He applies his personal view to the images and to the music. At the same time, it is his aim to provide every listener with a personal sense of access to the music. Djoric is sure that ""if Mussorgksy and Tchaikovsky had been more familiar with this instrument, they would have been fascinated by it.""",https://youtu.be/GAG01b2bil8,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=0301193BC&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Germany,2019 Edel Germany GmbH,2019 Edel Germany GmbH,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They are a comparatively recent addition, but their look and style as well as their use has shaped communication in our digital world. They are a pictorial, symbol-driven language and, in this way, quite close to the language of music notation. While using an emoji instead of a word makes communication more abstract, it also opens space for ambiguity and playfulness. Catalogue d’Emojis explores this ambiguity and playfulness in the communication between composer and performer. It is a fascinating multi-layered “concert event”. “Concert” emphasises the fact that it is a through-composed piece of music, while “event” relates to the FLUXUS idea of the “event score” and the fact that the performance is an extraordinary blend of sumptuous piano music, story-telling in yoga position, pseudo- poetry, a presentation on vegan music and much more! There is an emoji-based internal logic that holds everything together. Fumiko Miyachi and Kate Halsall, who together make up Cobalt Duo, are both ‘inspirational’ (Tempo) internationally-performing pianists who specialise in contemporary repertoire and interdisciplinary projects, often using technology. Michael Wolters and Paul Norman are internationally acclaimed composer-performers who specialise in creating unconventional events and performances. Wolters, whose music has been described as ‘utterly beguiling’ (Tempo) and ‘oddly moving’ (Guardian), creates works that deconstruct and question the traditional concert situation or which are designed for performance outside the concert hall altogether. In 2008 he soundtracked the BBC News live, and in 2012 he made a large-scale performance taking place on and around a German ice rink. For Norman, composing becomes a way of trying to understand little bits of the world and a way to highlight intriguing situations. In his work the audience is often encouraged to ask questions and to make decisions through the use of text-scores.",https://vimeo.com/283044073,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=BRC006&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Avant-Garde,,2019 Birmingham Record Company,2019 Birmingham Record Company,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

And yet who would think that the sensitive Russian style, so full of suggestion, discretion and nuance, of Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky’s Seasons (1840-1893) could find its echo in the silky, sensual work, the cheerful yet grave Four Seasons by Astor Piazzolla (1921-1992). The answer lies in the transcriptions by Alexander Goedicke (1877-1957) and Jose Bragato (1915-2017), which work wonders. By adding instrumental and harmonic elements, they bring out the secret alchemy of the original works. And in the precise yet generous interpretation by the Trio Boheme- and this is the first recording in Europe of Tchaikovsky’s Seasons transcribed for a Trio- one catches the dialogue, and even here and there the complicity, between the Russian and the Argentinian, both of whose lives and creations were so marked by Dance. Listen very closely to these works! Over the oceans and beyond time, hear what these two legendary composers are saying, in the timeless, universal language of Music: They speak of what the soul perceives when Dance takes hold. Ballet or Tango, it matters not. A Pas de Deux can convey both melancholy and heart-warming emotion.

He studied organ and composition at the Stockholm Conservatory (1886-1889), then traveled to Dresden for further instruction in composition and orchestration. As a composer, he was a Romantic nationalist. He wrote many large works -- his quasi-Wagnerian Arnljot is considered to be the Swedish national opera, and his third symphony and violin concerto are still highly regarded in his homeland -- but Peterson-Berger is best remembered for his miniatures, particularly the piano pieces Frösöblomster, and perhaps the song collection Swedish Lyrics.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=CAP%2021910&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Romantic Era,Sweden,2019 Caprice Records,2019 Caprice Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Douglas A. Lee puts the composer in line with Johann Georg Pisendel, Franz Benda and Leopold Mozart, thus recognizing Höckh as one of the founders of the violin school in the German-speaking area. The order in which the works on this album are arranged is not a coincidence – it partly refers (where possible) to the tonal relationships. Most interesting is the relationship between the first and the last sonata. Both works in the key of D major are almost identical in their texture. The first movements show an unusual similarity, although the final Sonata in D major has many more ornaments. The second movements remain almost identical, while the third movements have a common opening motif, but their developments and subsequent virtuoso performances evolve in completely different directions. These two works flanking the whole album are an interesting example of Carl Höckh’s development of form and composing inventiveness. A characteristic feature of all the works on this album is the enormous wealth of virtuoso means of expression. Höckh is much more demanding on the performer than his contemporaries. The use of dichords, entry to the eleventh position, unusually fast arpeggios, and even the use of tenths in dichords – these are but a few examples of the challenges facing the violinist. The melodics, harmony and motifs of Höckh’s works show distinctive features of the galant style. Since the exact dates of the sonatas cannot be determined – all materials were written by the hand of another copyist or published at a later date – their only chronological determinant is their stylistic characteristics. Despite some idiomatic treatment of the violin texture, the means used are often quite bold and demanding. Sudden jumps from the first to the sixth position, placing the work in the specific key of E major, not easy for the violin, are examples of breaking the instrumental convention and seeking new performance and sound possibilities. All these elements, in combination with the lyricism of the slow movements, allow us to define the work of the concertmaster from Zerbst as Pre-Romantic.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=ACD255&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Poland,2019 CD Accord,2019 Narodowe Forum Muzyki,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The rather sober scoring of La decollazione for strings and continuo might be explained by the Lenten presentation, but the vocal and instrumental demands of the piece fully exploited the brilliance of the Viennese musicians, and their skill in opera. At the same time, Bononcini integrated his skills in counterpoint, normally associated with sacred music, throughout the work so that it presents as both worldly and spiritual. This contrapuntal severity can be heard in the orchestral Introduction, the closing Coro Muore il giusto, sung by the 5 soloists, and several of the arias, particularly St John’s Bacio l’ombre, set in the dark key of F minor. The role of St John is sung by an alto, a vocal register often used for heroes in baroque opera, when they were performed by castrati with powerful lungs. The morally weak Herod is sung by a bass, while Herodias and Salome would both have been sung by soprano castrati representing women, and are given music that is especially sensuous in style. The duet Rieda pure sung by Herod and Herodias early in the piece would be an effective love duet in any opera of the time, and yet is also impressively contrapuntal, interlocking the lovers in the ways of earlier Italian madrigals. Bononcini employs the convention of the da capo aria throughout the oratorio, but writes out the return of the A sections rather than using the shorthand of DC. However, at the dramatic turning point in the story, where Salome is singing the solo De la palme and we presume is dancing for the guests, Herod cuts her off with his passionate recitative Non più, deh cessa before she has even completed the B section. After that, he begins his offer of granting her a wish. While this break with musical convention might seem like a small thing today, in Bononcini’s time, it was a very unusual and vivid depiction of Salome’s erotic power and Herod’s weakness.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=ACD256&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Poland,2019 CD Accord,2019 Narodowe Forum Muzyki,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

His Sacra Partitura, a collection of eight motets and two sonatas, was printed in Strasbourg in 1651, when his negotiation with the church council had already begun. These compositions might have been decisive for Böddecker’s appointment, particularly as the composer dedicated the collection to the Duke’s musical sister, Duchess Sibylla. The music is composed in typical concertante style, but influenced by Italian monody and Monteverdi’s seconda pratica. In his preface, Böddecker informs us that he would have “preferred to publish a work with more voices than just a voce sola”, but was forced to comply with the specifications of the “coffers” and the publisher in the troubled times after the Thirty Years’ War. The compositional technique is not, however, a makeshift solution. On the contrary, Böddecker’s fine works fit into a style of music which had increasingly been flourishing in German-speaking regions since the first half of the century: the sacred concerto for small ensemble, placing a virtuous melody with great emphasis on the text above a richly scored basso continuo group.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=CHR77433&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Germany,2019 note 1 music gmbh,2019 note 1 music gmbh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The ensemble was founded by Richard Köster in 2017. Its music is inspired and driven by the coastline paradox phenomenon that describes the counterintuitive observation that the coastline of a landmass does not have a well-defined length. The length depends in fact on the scale and method used to measure it. Because of its fractal-like properties the length of every coastline is practically infinite. Along every coastline distance and diversity blend into something unique that can only be found right there. The closer you look at it, the more details you are going to find. The music of coastline paradox is at home in the border zone and dedicates itself to attention to detail. Excitement is where sea hits the shore, where the continent opens up into vastness.

Thus the goddess of love Venus deceives her husband Vulcanus with the god of war Mars, and the Roman poet Ovid writes in his Amores the winged word: ""Militat omnis amans"" (Every lover is a soldier in war). These conditions were also reflected musically in modern times, when the masters of the 16th century emphasized sometimes more the warlike, sometimes more the amorous playfulness of love in their works.

At Thélème, there is no outer wall, no clock.

Work on a work, be it one's own or that of someone else, is never over. Every space, every instrument, every moment demands new ideas, adjustments, its own timbres and gestures. Every aspect of music-making is thereby filled with a living, forward-flowing energy; even sections that appear at first sight to be slow or reflective become animated. In the best sense, every work and every interpretation is thus a ""work in progress"": a bustling process of constant renewal, of creative musical creation. As a member of the composition class of Kodály's pupil Ferenc Szabó, in his own output Zsigmond Szathmáry quickly fell under the influence of a rhythmically-charged musical language, folk-music traditions and the unique harmonic and dissonant language of Béla Bartók. After his emigration to Western Europe, he became acquainted with avant-garde techniques through lessons with Karlheinz Stockhausen and collaborations with his compatriot György Ligeti, and was able to translate them into his own musical language. Zsigmond Szathmáry simultaneously became one of the leading interpreters of contemporary organ music: his extraordinary skills were put to use when he succeeded Gerd Zacher, himself celebrated for his performances of modern organ works, as organist in Hamburg-Wellingsbüttel, and he later inaugurated the contemporary music series Forum Bremer Dom during his tenure as cathedral organist in Bremen.

His complex character, with all its polarities and conflicts considering the challenges he confronted, provides the material for many chapters of human, artistic and historical relevance: Not only because of his spectacular abduction from West Berlin to Seoul in the late 1960s, which we hear him depict in his own words in tense and heartfelt terms, as part of his overall personal trajectory. No, also because, indeed especially because, of his fascinating work: Yun developed over decades a unique and totally distinctive language made up of the eastern and western influences that had formed him, so that he could say at the end of his life, The split within me has been fully overcome, even if the partition of his beloved homeland Korea caused him suffering to the very end. “The cello was like my spouse,” as we hear Isang Yun report in archival recordings, in which he also tells in detail about his spectacular kidnapping and imprisonment in Korea. It is therefore quite fitting that this most autobiographical instrument for Yun, as Holger Groschopp says in his conversation with Mirjam Wiesemann, is the focal point of this celebratory production marking the 10th anniversary of our Artists in Conversation Edition. Of his great Cello Concerto (1975/76), for example, Yun said: “As the cello was my favorite instrument from my childhood onward, I took it as the focal point.” He regarded the cello as his own beautiful, weak voice, to be confronted with the dramatic, destructive world.

It is this empathy possessed by Biondi which has inspired the Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia in Rome (from its bowed instrument collection) to make him a loan of the precious 1690 “Tuscan” violin made by Antonio Stradivari, for this Glossa recording. Another skill possessed by Biondi is his deft assemblage of programmes, whether for concert or for record, and this new release of early eighteenth-century violin works touches on the impact that Corelli’s music had on music-making in Dresden, Venice, Padua, London and Amsterdam, to name just a few of the destinations affected as the fame of “Arcangelo Bolognese” fanned out from Rome across Europe. With a continuo team from his Europa Galante ensemble, Biondi plays sonatas by Vivaldi, Corelli, Geminiani, Tartini and Locatelli, and a Ciaccona by Veracini.

The value of this first libretto, magnified by the superb music of Cavalli, lies above all in the beauty and rich poetry of its literary style. Musically, the work is still, in certain respects, dependent on the Florentine tradition of recitar cantando: until fairly late in the Seicento, recitative remained the most important and prestigious musical and stylistic tool in opera. Nonetheless, closed forms are fairly widespread, and the opera abounds in ensembles. The rhythmic and metrical richness of the text allows Cavalli to give free rein to his creative genius: arias, lamenti, duets, even trios, choruses – the variety of strophic forms is as great as the expressiveness of the recitative… Glossa now reissues a fine recording of this opera, performed by the Argentinian Gabriel Garrido and his Ensemble Elyma, with a splendid vocal cast including Anders Dahlin, Rosa Domínguez, Emanuela Galli, Paola Quagliata and Salvo Vitale.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=GCD923519&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Netherlands,2008 K617,2019 note 1 music gmbh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

My imaginative powers, my musical energy (timbres, sounds, creativity, poetry) must be imbued with this richness. New music looks quite different from what it was in Bach’s day (some even say it is all philosophy now, no melodies, notes or harmonies required). If modern music is still to be music, even today, and if it is still to enrich people’s lives, a thing of value that they can and will remember, then Bach’s store of wealth can always come to the aid of us composers.

Not only did he demonstrate huge vitality and charisma as a conductor, and compose the wonderful music that is his legacy, but he worked tirelessly as a communicator and “pedagogue”. His explanations of wide-ranging aspects of music to the viewers of his television programme for children, his lectures at Harvard University and his books have all been an enormous source of information. In recognition of the centenary of his birth, we dedicate to him this recording of his works for clarinet. At the same time, we pay homage to another musician whom I greatly admire - Benny Goodman - and include two other works directly linked to the theme of this album - the impact of jazz on Bernstein’s output. In “Lenny” (Bernstein’s nickname among his friends and collaborators), Oscar Navarro perfectly captures the spirit of the great master’s music. After playing in the première of his work for chamber group, I was so impressed that I asked Oscar for a version for clarinet. I am most grateful to Oscar for his efforts. The Kapustin Trio, originally for flute, elaborates on the impact of jazz on classical composition from a more contemporary perspective. In the years between Bernstein and Kapustin, rock, pop and other trends all made their mark, and their influence can likewise be heard in this trio. I was urged to make this version by my friends and collaborators Juan Carlos Garvayo and Paco Moya, and I hope listeners will appreciate how well it works with clarinet.

Dvorák transforms it into a warm lyrical baritone. He repopulates it with harmonics and nuances. And he shows us that the best way to overcome cello “limitations” is none other than to transcend it. Dvorák turns the cello into a meta-cello. Just as in a Mephistophelian pact, he achieves the feat of “animating” it. And the soul is in the score. You have to know how to find it. No one better to do it than Adolfo Gutiérrez Arenas, from his sensitivity, spontaneity and affinity to an instrument he would never have wanted to explore if Bach and Dvorák had not persuaded him otherwise.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=IBS-32019&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Spain,2019 IBS Artist,2019 IBS Artist,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The collection is very important for collectors because it has never been on the market before. Following the archive’s launch in October 2017 with successive releases featuring Beecham, Bohm, Cantelli, Casadesus, Karajan, Menuhin, Monteux, du Pre, Klemperer, Rostropovich and Walter, it has received universal praise from both the classical media and record collectors for the excellent sound and performances. Carlo Maria Giulini’s celebrated studio recording of Le nozze di Figaro was recorded in September 1959 following a live performance at the Royal Festival Hall a few days earlier. Nearly 18 months later there was another performance but with a substantially different cast. Harold Rosenthal in Opera magazine wrote of the concert performance: “Giulini’s reading of this miraculous score has deepened since the studio recording… the spark that was suddenly kindled between conductor and Teresa Berganza in ‘Voi che sapete’ was a moment to treasure. Indeed all Miss Berganza’s singing was outstanding.”",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=ICAC5157&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Germany,"2019 BBC, under licence to International Classical Artists Ltd.Licensed by BBC Worldwide.",2019 International Classical Artists Ltd,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

French music was a favorite of Beecham and this set is made up of music by Chabrier, Franck, Gretry, Lalo, Mehul and Saint-Saens, all of which he recorded in the studio but when Beecham was caught ‘live,’ it often showed the mercurial side of his character and no performance was ever the same. As David Patmore said in an essay: ‘What Beecham sought at all times was freshness and his unpredictability was one way of achieving this.’ The Franck is played for all its worth while the Mehul, rather than being performed as a period performance, is treated as a romantic composer in a big-boned approach.

At the performance, instruments, human bodies, electronic apparatus or anything else may be used.” Side two features two works by saxophonist, composer and bandleader Cath Roberts, Off-World and March of the Egos, interpreted by CUEE (City University Experimental Ensemble). The latter was a new commission for the 25-piece ensemble, who perform both live, recorded at London’s experimental music hub IKLECTIK. David Toop says about interpreting Boundary Music: ""I’ve worked on Mieko Shiomi’s Boundary Music over a long period of time and in a variety of contexts: commissioning musicians to record new versions of the piece for the Playing John Cage exhibition I curated at Arnolfini Bristol (2005-6) and exploring it with students from London College of Communication in both workshops and public performances (Tate Modern, 2010, Whitechapel Gallery, 2015). Two things seem obvious at the first moment of reading the score: that it’s simple and about silence. Very quickly, both of those hasty assumptions become uncertain. More accurately, it’s a deep and complex piece about thresholds, the divisions between phenomena and their shifting, vibrating ambiguity, the movement between one state or set of conditions and another. For example, the ‘faintest possible sound’ may not be faint at all or it may be so faint that it only exists as a thought. In the context of so-called music a boundary condition may belong to history, genre, technologies, the notion of a physical ‘instrument’ and its apparent edges or functions. In this performance my questions were concentrated in a field of personal boundaries. How close could I come to those boundaries and give birth to that sound?""",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=MM02&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Avant-Garde,,2019 multi.modal,2019 multi.modal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A collection of early Renaissance devotional objects- elegantly precise boxwood carvings of miniature rosaries, prayer beads and altarpieces, on display as part of a major international exhibition- served as the direct inspiration for this musical program. These objects draw viewers into a private and intimate world of meditation; religious scenes carved with precision and poetry evoke a bygone world of intense spiritual devotion- sometimes tormented, sometimes luminous, but always fascinating. The music in this program is designed to elicit similar sensations in listeners. Originating in northern European circles, contemporary with those who produced these boxwood carvings, these spiritual pieces are not intended for grand cathedrals or public ceremony, but for personal meditation, private chapels and rooms, family houses and assemblies.

Composer Matt Frey, who identified with the Swissair tragedy due to his own brush with a plane malfunction, explores human relationship to air travel while also commemorating the lives lost in the chamber opera ONE-ELEVEN HEAVY. Using recollections from reporters on the scene, interviews with family members including words from the pilot’s wife when she arrived on the scene, and even the original Air Traffic Control recordings from the crash, Frey depicts the story in four parts. Beginning with the ATC recordings, the voices of soprano Jenny Ribeiro and tenor Karim Sulayman rise to the surface, painting the image of the scene as the radio recordings describe it starting to happen. Filled with a sense of anxiety and coming undone, the text tells the story in reverse chronology. The opera builds to the point of no return where plane alarms can be heard and voices and instruments meet for a tumultuous climax. The album concludes with a chilling epilogue featuring ocean sounds and ATC recordings as those on the opposite end started coming to the realization that Swissair 111 had gone down. “The Swissair passengers never got to tell their story. For them I wrote ONE-ELEVEN HEAVY.” Frey’s album achieves that and more, presenting an intellectual, emotional, and powerful opera that both commemorates the lives lost and adds to the rich catalog of the contemporary chamber opera.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB03e7CDbRo&feature=youtu.be,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=NV6226&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Avant-Garde,,,2019 Navona Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Kennedy ,In Tandem - Solos & Duos,Vit Muzik; Petr Nouzovsky; Ondrej Jurceka; Karel Martinek; Lucie Kaucka; Sauro Berti; Christopher Morrison; Stephanie Watt ,1,CD,11.69,11.69,"Introducing the album is Lee Actor’s Duo for Violin and Cello. The track, which won the Eva Thompson Phillips Award for Composition in 1979, is a short, textured, and powerful piece. In ABA form, the energy of the stringed instruments swings like a parabola from the height of sharp, angular rhythms down into deep and gentle expressions and builds up to a sharp, explosive climax. Contrasting with this minimal violin-cello duo, Peter Greve’s Aria is slow and expansive. The composer pairs the trumpet and organ, mastering the interweaving of the brass instrument’s long slurring path around the subtle foundation laid by the keys. The sonata Marian is a composition created by Steven Kennedy. Kennedy’s composition represents a polyptych of the Life of Jesus Christ, interpreted through the grace of the violin and piano. In four carefully composed pieces, Kennedy guides the listener through Christ’s beginnings (“Advent l’enfant”), alongside Christ as he walks to the cross (“Lento Doloroso”), the thunderous early stages of the movement of his tomb (“Resurrectio""), and finally the arrival of the Holy Spirit (“Jubilatio Spiritu""). Sidney Bailin employs jazz influences in Blue Plea. Writing for clarinet, the tone of the piece is influenced by the 2nd movement of the Brahms Clarinet Quintet. Though the atmosphere of the piece often feels improvisational, the careful calculation of Bailin’s every note creates a story, one of sorrow and pleading, that introduces subjects and counter-subjects through his use of riffs. The last track of the album, Allen Brings’ Duo for Flute and Piano, closes the album with three movements. Echoing some of the themes of J.S. Bach’s inventions, the flute and piano create a relationship that is at once contentious and allied. The composition creates a back-and-forth between the two instruments like a game of tag, influencing each others’ performances in both moments of softness and ferocity.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SB6Zs36jJE&feature=youtu.be,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=NV6227&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,,,2019 Navona Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

McKinley; Almeida Prado; George Rochberg; John Sharpley; Ellen Taaffe Zwilich ,Roberta Rust: Direct Contact,Roberta Rust ,1,CD,11.69,11.69,"Pianist Roberta Rust brings her own unique dynamism to the works of eight composers with whom she has had direct contact over the years. Dedicated to her late mother and step-daughter, this collection is as personal and touching as it is memorable for the broader audience. The album commences with Blues from George Rochberg’s Carnival Music. This piece is true to its name in style and form with the riffs and improvisations to prove it. Michael Anderson’s Thirteen plus 4 and Sonata create a contemplative setting, where every tone cluster and arpeggio is connected to the next. Rust skillfully gives each phrase its own story. Rust shares three selections from Leo Brouwer’s Diez Bocetos. Moving from dark and mysterious to mischievous and experimental, the piece shows that after the darkness, light does emerge, leaving the listener on a hopeful plateau. In Ellen Taaffe Zwilich’s Lament, Rust pays close attention to structure, truly capturing the traditional yet experimental compositional style for which Zwilich is known. In Almeida Prado’s Halley, all the forces of nature appear in this tonally-liberated work, likely influenced by the composer’s studies with Messiaen and Boulanger. It is a voyage into the uncharted, but the finish is demure. In Phillip Evans’ Suite 1945, the pianist graces us with a “Sarabande” and “Aria.” The composer’s affinity for Bartok is evident in this piano composition that spans a breadth of emotions. His exquisite “Minuetto” is nuanced and precious and Rust gives it the delicate delivery it deserves. Thomas L. McKinley’s Fantasy Pieces for Piano demonstrates Rust’s ability to portray more rustic, raw themes in her performances. Concluding the album are three selections from John Sharpley’s Four Preludes. Rust thrills her listener with suspense, the latter party holding on in anticipation of her every note and phrase. The New York Times hailed Rust as “a powerhouse of a pianist—one who combines an almost frightening fervor and intensity with impeccable technique and spartan control.”",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vMK2AFk3Lo&feature=youtu.be,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=NV6229&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Piano,,,2019 Navona Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The director for both stage and screen is Phyllida Lloyd, and Harriet Walter is Henry IV. The Donmar Shakespeare Trilogy began in 2012 with an all-female production of Julius Caesar led by Dame Harriet Walter. Set in a women's prison, the production asked the question, ""Who owns Shakespeare?""

This accolade has been picked up time and again, gone through various manifestations, and become a sort of trademark of the German bass Gottlob Frick. That said, the attribute ""black"" is often applied to define the vocal range of a basso profundo's ability to produce sonorous deep notes. However, the definition of ""black bass"" means far more than that: it applies primarily to the deep, dark timbre, the rich and sonorous sound and the lasting flexibility of the voice even in the deep registers, paired with strength, momentum, natural resonance and abundant expression in the entire vocal range. ""If you have ever heard the timbre of Gottlob Frick's voice, you will never forget it,"" as the German singing expert Jürgen Kesting accurately observed in his standard reference work ""Die großen Sänger"". Gottlob Frick is seen rightly therefore as the incarnation of the black bass. He is a German bass who, thanks to the many sound recordings he left us documenting his sonorous, unusually beautiful and fluently melodic singing, enjoys a popularity to this day that is probably unparalleled in this vocal register. One of the reasons the internationally renowned critic John B.

His voice is steady despite its powerful capacity, supple and splendid. Frick's two-and-a-half-octave bass is remarkably well trained and remains constant through its entire spectrum.

Luiza Borac has been celebrated as “a dream of a pianist” (Rondo), “a worthy ambassador for a genius” (Music & Vision) and a pianist of “subtle but absolute mastery” (BBC Music Magazine). Gramophone has commented that “Borac’s only substantial rival is Dinu Lipatti in the Third Sonata” and Hi-Fi has noted that “Luiza Borac creates an extraordinary sense of identification with the music ... a revelation”. The UNESCO city of Albi has awarded her the honorific title of “Ambassadrice de la Cité épiscopale” and also its medal of honor in recognition of her involvement in PolioPlus, an international project run by Rotary with the aim of eradicating polio. Her double album release, featuring compositions by the legendary pianist Dinu Lipatti, forms part of her collaboration with the Academy of St Martin in the Fields and includes the first ever recordings of several works.

The exciting thing is that the Schubert Fifth Symphony is one of the earliest radio magnetic tape recordings that we have. The 1941/42 season had just ended when the stage of the Steinsaal in Dresden’s Hygiene Museum was first prepared for use as a broadcasting studio for the programmes of Reichssender Berlin. In contrast to the gramophone recordings current until then, brand new magnetic-tape players were humming in an adjoining room, in service for the first time that year as a high fidelity replacement for the disc cutters that had been used for the past decade and more. The use of magnetic tape opened up a new and more varied world of sound to the broadcasting technicians. Whereas music programmes had previously broadcast longer works from discs playing for three or four minutes, involving constant changes of disc, the broadcasting engineers now had a “sound scribe” and the associated “magnetic tape” medium that would record and transmit recordings lasting up to 20 minutes per tape plate. That meant that complete movements of symphonies could be recorded and played without a break. No wonder, then, that the “Magnetophone” tapes promptly replaced the highly breakable wax discs. Musicians and conductors were equally appreciative of the new recording method, given that it was no longer a matter of the highest priority to play with maximum concentration and minimum error for as long as possible, since the Tonmeister’s “magic snips” would leave any mistakes or shortcomings on the cutting-room floor. The 1942 recording of Schubert’s Symphony No. 5 presented here is a priceless early audio document, surely the first attested Magnetophone recording by the Dresden Staatskapelle.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=PH19023&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Germany,1942 by Reichsrundfunk; 1979 Rundfunk der DDR licenced by Telepool GmbH,2019 Profil Medien GmbH,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The sounds they convey are lean but not mean, spare beyond compare, very European, and unlike any of his contemporary groups, the Esbjorn Svensson Trio, or ECM groups in particular. The inventive drumming of Kaspar Rast provides supple support for Bartsch, Mats Eser’s marimba, and the bass clarinet or alto sax work of Don Li. There’s an airy, spacious, and cool Scandinavian feel to all of the pieces, dubbed “Moduls.” The development of “Modul 5” is lugubriously slow, almost ritualistic, and based on a one-note bass piano key vamp, while a mere three notes in a pseudo waltz with juxtaposed drum rhythms from Rast cement the most palpable distinct groove during “Modul 11.” Their most labyrinth and bottomless underground voicing is “Modul 4,” and while staying in that mode, “Modul 2” is extremely quiet and low-key, with a nominal understated advance that is hard even to discern. There’s a short free minimalist piece quite similar to Steve Reich and a concluding solo piano offering from Bartsch that further emphasizes space between notes being much more important and prevalent than the notes themselves. A tip-of-the-iceberg recording, in the figurative and literal sense, one can speculate this is a mere beginning, almost child’s play, for what Bartsch and his crew have in store for the future of his compelling and singularly original music.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=RON%20001&medium=phy,02 Jazz,Jazz,,Netherlands,2006 Ronin Rhythm Records,2006 Ronin Rhythm Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The track offers a stark contrast to the feel good vibes of “Free Your Mind,” taking on a somewhat spiritual demeanor, due as much to Petrella’s evocative trombone playing as to Amofah’s lofty vocals or the reeling nature of the percussion.

Biber, Merula and Monteverdi's passacaglias are as much a common denominator for interaction between different cultures as the blues. The European art music in the baroque era did not suddenly appear in a magic fountain in the centre of Europe around 1600. Quite the opposite; it developed through immigration, conquest, assimilation, curiosity and openness. Oriental Winds of the Baroque follow these lines backwards, open to what might turn up. Biber's re-tuning the strings and using improvisation in his music, is closely connected to how the folk musicians all over Europe worked, especially in Norway. Furthermore the tonality of the traditional religious songs in Norway, is sometimes similar to the way religious and other music is sung in the Middle East. Kouame Sereba’s timeless vocals, dodo and kalimba can together with the Italian theorbo and the Norwegian traditional Hardanger fiddle give the listener associations to the curious intercultural meetings that became the origins to the later stylized baroque and classical music, and then in turn our other Western musical styles.

The quartet has actively collaborated with current composers and commissioned and premiered numerous works by various composers. The quartet’s repertoire extends from the renaissance through the classical masters and Siggi String Quartet four members have great passion for 20 and 21th century repertoire. “Experimenting with sound and texture, improvisation and life electronics is an important part of our work. It does deepen our understanding of the standard repertoire indirectly, and it goes both ways.” Playing a late Beethoven parallel to working on Haukur Tómasson Serimonia makes us aim for rhythmical super-precision and working on Mamiko Dís Ragnarsdóttir Fair Flowers after performing the same Beethoven pushed us into the long phrases, picturing endless moss, grey and green and the tiny wild Icelandic flowers in bright violet and yellow. Una Sveinbjarnardóttir´s piece Opacity is more free, the structure is simple and the improvisando feeling is reigning. Daníel Bjarnason wrote Stillshot in 2015. The piece is dreamy and nostalgic and in form resembles a chaconne, where the same chord progression repeats itself throughout. In the middle of the piece there is a retreat from the harmonic structure before it resumes the form until the end. The composer describes the piece as depicting fragmented memories of a noblewoman. The recollections appear abruptly and vanish quickly, some of them distant but others more focused and clear. The title of the piece refers to the early days of photography where people would have to stay still for considerable time so the camera would produce a clear picture.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=DSL-92232&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Chamber Music,United States,2019 Sono Luminus,2019 Sono Luminus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In Steffen Schleiermacher’s Das Tosen des staunenden Echos (The roar of the amazed echo) the paradox of a ""roaring stillness"" unfolds in a kind of cantus firmus - echoing ritual recitations from Laos - which meanders amongst the various instruments and moves towards its finale with sonic force. Kaija Saariaho’s storm references are more literary in nature: Shakespeare’s play The Tempest serves as a backdrop for her Songbook of the same name and provides the lyrics for the pieces sung finely nuanced by Olivia Vermeulen and Peter Schöne. In antagonisme contrôlé, by Michael Wertmüller, the storm takes place in the formal structure of the work, where the different temperatures of free jazz and new music collide: Peter Brötzmann - on of the leading free jazz-artists today - together with Ensemble Musikfabrik’s percussionist, Dirk Rothbrust, on drumset and Marino Pliakas on e-bass create a high pressure system to face the headwind of the full ensemble.

It’s Saxophone Summit’s fourth album since sax giants Michael Brecker, David Liebman and Joe Lovano first joined forces in 1999 to celebrate John Coltrane’s epochal late-career musical production. And Street Talk is the first Saxophone Summit album that includes alto saxophone icon Greg Osby, who joined the group for the summer tour that preceded this August 30, 2017 studio date. Osby replaced Ravi Coltrane, who had assumed the third tenor saxophone chair on the albums Seraphic Light (2008) and Visitation (2011) after Brecker’s death in 2007. As on each of Saxophone Summit’s aforementioned albums, pianist Phil Markowitz, bassist Cecil McBee, and drummer Billy Hart form an extraordinarily sensitive rhythm section that at once propels, coheres and complements the inspired flow of the three saxophonists, each an instantly recognizable voice. Liebman emphasizes the shamanistic Hart’s essential role, describing him as “an extreme storyteller and dramatist who can handle three to four solos and not have repetitions.” Rather than perform their heroic interpretations of Coltrane’s repertoire, which the musicians know, as author Ashley Kahn once wrote, “with a chapter-and-verse familiarity, Saxophone Summit performs an original composition by each member. “The Coltrane influence in Sax Summit is alive, but we’ve steered away from it on purpose as a representation of the group,” Liebman says. “We keep that spirit, and play tunes with that vibe or feel, but it’s our own music — our collective experience put together. We’ve each come up with a common basis while retaining an individuality that’s unique to each of us.”",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=ENJ-9767&medium=phy,02 Jazz,Jazz,,Germany,2019 werner aldinger,2019 werner aldinger,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It reaches neither the extreme height of the violin nor the rumbling depth and the strength of the cello and contrabass. Its role is more integrating than leading or polarizing; and in brilliance, maneuverability and sound projection the violin wins hands down. But if a composer wants to express his or her feelings with maximum intensity and depth, he chooses the viola remarkably often. The loss of a loved one, a repressive political system, persecution and war were more than once the motivation for the composing of music with the viola as the most important voice for expressing the underlying emotions. The dark, somewhat veiled sound of the instrument makes it particularly suited to such a role. On this album, the second of two, we have recorded Mendelssohn, Gal, Shostakovich and Hindemith.
