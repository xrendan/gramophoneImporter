Now, Kuijken returns with a new release. This recording includes the work of three great masters dedicated to the theme of Christmas: Dietrich Buxtehude (1637-1707), Johann Sebastian Bach (1685-1750) and Georg Philipp Telemann (1681-1767). All three created a large number of cantatas for many occasions, each according to his own perspective and tradition. The Christmas cantatas were always of a special nature; the birth of Christ was celebrated everywhere- both in a solemn and festive setting and in a smaller circle- and if one listens carefully and considers the different approaches, one can virtually peer into the composer's heart. Bach takes center stage in this new production, Buxtehude is its be-all and end-all and Telemann bridges in between two very different opuses.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=ACC%2024348&medium=phydig,01 Classical,Classical,,,2018 Accent,2018 Accent,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Over the years, more than 1,400 works of sacred music and more than 250 concertos and orchestral works have gathered from his pen and paper.

Its vintage opener is the first Cello Sonata by Brahms, a pinnacle of unspeakable but mind-controlled beauty. Martinu's second Cello Sonata, written in American exile in 1941, revisits Brahms's old world, but with wider tonality, more expressive shifts, and the extra rhythmic pulse of Czech folk music. In Schnittke's Cello Sonata of 1978, which builds on Shostakovich's emaciated style, the ghosts of the desolate closing Largo usher in the death throes of Romanticism. This is a captivating album that draws its fascination not from the uniformity of the pieces included, but from their distinct differences. Born in Poland, Kacper Nowak began playing the cello at the age of eight. A year later, he was the laureate of the Liezen Cello Competition in Austria and entered the Fryderyk Chopin School in Poznan, in the class of Danuta Taczanowska.

Bach and Domenico Scarlatti: "Both Scarlatti and Bach were prophetic composers. The former founded a modern language for the keyboard. To perform his sonatas, independence of the fingers combined with new positions of the hands is required. In fact Scarlatti was such a deep and polyhedric explorer of the possibilities of the harpsichord that his works seem to be composed for the modern piano, an instrument which offers a thousand possibilities. The art of the German composer, on the other hand, characterized by an elaborated harmonic language and a detailed polyphonic writing, encompasses all the compositional techniques of that period and even creates new ones. His music offers an absolute reference model until today for classical music and also for jazz. Thus the works of these musicians are still fresh and I think it is natural to perform and record them today."",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=AG0010&medium=phydig,01 Classical,Classical,,,2018 paladino media,2018 paladino media,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rossini; Coro del Teatro della Fortuna M. Agostini,1,CD,13.25,20.99,"In an age of ultraspecialization that obsesses over minute detail, artists such as Nicola Alaimo remind us that, as elsewhere, in opera versatility is a virtue. The youthful Mr. Alaimo has an impressive CV, broad in scope and variety. His chosen musical home is, of course, 19th century melodrama, ranging from his beloved Rossini, to Bellini, Donizetti and the major works of Verdi. Nonetheless, Mr. Alaimo is thoroughly comfortable with an earlier repertoire comprising Mozart and the Neapolitans, and also with the music of a later era. The giovane scuola had no great love for baritones, but Mr. Alaimo has sung Puccini, Cilea and his Neri Chiaramantesi in Giordano's Cena della beffe made its mark on opera lovers. The results speak for themselves and his career is there for all to see. Doubters may seek out major venues, conductors or directors where or with whom Nicola Alaimo has not performed- they will not find any, however. Mr. Alaimo has sung Rossini not only all over the world, but also close to home in a long successful partnership with the Rossini Opera Festival in Pesaro as Dandini in Cenerentola, don Bartolo in The Barber of Seville, Aliprando in Matilde di Shabran, the title role in Guillaume Tell, dom Pomponio in Gazzetta, and the Duke of Ordow in Torvaldo e Dorliska.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=GB%202571-2&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Italy,2018 Bongiovanni,2018 Bongiovanni,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The success of Il Prata, with a plot containing all the ingredients of Romantic popular literature, convinced Bellini and Romani to continue in the same direction and early in August 1828 they decided on their source: The gothic novel L'Etrangere by Charles D'Arlincourt, set in an imaginary medieval Brittany. A new anti-Rossini approach was recognized by Bellini's contemporaries as a mark of his modernity, featuring a plain vocal style free of ornament and attentive to the emotional meaning of words. Critics were immediately award of Bellini's innovations in La Straniera. A partial sacrifice of belcanto was inevitable if opera singing was to be once more expressive and dramatic and rid itself of the flowery ornamental and virtuoso style then in vogue. In Bellini's mature style, coloratura and vocal virtuosity are never a pretext for showing off but always intrinsic to the action. A hallmark of Bellini's style, the arioso led to a revision of the recitative which, in order to evolve into the arioso, abandoned conventional formulae and so took on an expressive power wholly new in Italian opera at the time. The same search for flexible form is found in the lyric pieces, which Bellini revised in accordance with the needs of the action. The absence of routine numbers meant he did not indulge in the customary practice of self-borrowing from his previous operas or using La Straniera as a source for future works.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=AB%2020038&medium=phy,DVD/Bluray,DVD/Bluray,,Italy,2018 Bongiovanni,2018 Bongiovanni,62 Classic Films,5,Alessandro Vargetto; Andrea Cigni; Emanuele D'Aguanno; Enrico Marrucci; Francesca Tiburzi; Maurizio Muscolino; Orchestra e Coro del Teatro Massimo Bellini di Catania; Riccardo Palazzo; Sebastiano Rolli; Sonia Fortunato; Vincenzo Bellini ,Sebastiano Rolli,1,2018 Bongiovanni,2018 Bongiovanni,IT,NR,NTSC,0,DVD-9,Italian,"Italian, English",Stereo PCM,Color,16:9,145,2018,

I remember when I was working on the Ruralia hungarica, my father recognized many of the melodies from the songs he had learned as a boy."

The Humoresken Op. 17 from 1907 date from when he taught in Berlin. They are basically romantic in nature and now and then reminiscent of Brahms' piano music.

Oskar Gottlieb Blarr's Jesus Passion is the highlight of the album, but one also hears an interesting conversation with Blarr as well as with Odilo Klasen, a Blarr specialist. The secret to the success of the Jesus Passion, according to Klasen, lies in one of the peculiarities of Blarr's style: the fact that it is immediately comprehensible, "even for those who know nothing at all of the complex processes involved." To this end, the enthusiastic response from audiences and critics alike to the 26 performances of the oratorio between the premiere in 1985 and 2018 speaks for itself. Beginning with stories about his childhood in Eastern Prussia, the escape in 1945 and the subsequent stages of his life until 1961, when he settled in Dusseldorf, where he lives to this day, one can follow intently as the seeds of many far-reaching impressions from early in the life of OG Blarr develop and unfold, leaving indelible marks on him. In his Jesus Passion, Blarr aims to tell a story without anti-Semitism. Especially in our era of general xenophobia reaching new and frightening proportions, this essential aspect sets the tone.",https://www.cybele.de/oskar-gottlieb-blarr-und-die-jesus-passion,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=Cybele%203SACD%20KiG%20010&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Orchestral,Germany,2018,2018,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Danish composer Peter Navarro-Alonso's composition is a note-by-note reinvention of the original Goldberg Variations by J.S. Bach. Thus Alpha's innovative performance adds no additional notes in comparison to the original. It is merely through the very creative and extreme orchestration that the new composition gains its own life. "The combination of recorder, saxophone and percussion is clearly not very well suited to a baroque-style reorchestration," claims Peter Navarro-Alonso, responsible for this arrangement tailor made for the members of Alpha. "But the richness in that combination lies in its enormous diversity in timbre and dynamics." Alpha is a unique Danish ensemble, founded by Bolette Roed, Peter Navarro-Alonso, and David Hildebrandt, who all graduated from the soloist class at the Royal Danish Academy of Music, Copenhagen. As early as 2003, they were the first to explore this instrument combination, attracted by its many possibilities.

But in Portugal - a kingdom without a king, its people governed by a foreign power - such settings gave life, as well, to a rich expression of covert political commentary. Rory McCleery's ongoing interest in this field of polyphony bears fruit for the first time in a groundbreaking programme. Many of these Portuguese composers are known, if at all, for a very few pieces. Once again, McCleery and his Consort make a clarion call for music that deserves, and with their advocacy should now receive, far wider recognition. Taking its name from the Blessed Virgin Mary, a focus of religious devotion in the sacred music of all ages, The Marian Consort is a Gramophone Award-nominated and internationally renowned early music vocal ensemble, recognized for its dynamic freshness of approach and innovative presentation of a broad range of repertoire.

It is deep, ultimately spiritual and brilliantly crafted, with influences from the Russian symphonic tradition colored by Mahler, Scriabin, Honegger and Messiaen to name a few - but melded into a unique voice. The Requiem, together with his massive Symphony cycles, was the work which brought enormous acclaim to Artyomov both in Russia and in the USA. It was the first Requiem to be written by a Russian and the first to be performed in the former USSR. Dedicated 'to the Martyrs of Long-Suffering Russia' it is a true masterpiece in which several parts of the mass are given treatments very different from the 'norm'.

Born in Bezhitz, Russia in 1924, she began to play the piano at age three. She soon became a student of Alexander Goldenweiser (1875-1961), the leading piano pedagogue in Russia. From 1947 she toured extensively in the USSR. Her recognition outside of the USSR was boosted as she became the 1st prize winner of the 1950 Leipzig Bach competition. There she met Shostakovich who served on the Jury. They became friends and associates. Shostakovich considered her the ideal interpreter of his piano works and wrote for her the 24 Preludes & Fugues, Op. 87 which she premiered in 1952. Nikolayeva frequently toured Europe, America, and Japan. She had an unusually large repertory including most of the keyboard works of Bach and Beethoven. She was also a highly esteemed composer with several symphonies, chamber music and a piano concerto to her credit. In 1959 she began teaching at the Moscow conservatory, becoming a professor in 1965. She suffered a cerebral hemorrhage at a concert she gave in San Francisco on November 13, 1993. Tatiana Nikolayeva, the great pianist, composer and teacher died on November 22, 1993.

In 1962, Presti and Lagoya came to teach at the Jeunesses Musicales summer camp near Mount Orford, returning yearly until Presti's sudden and tragic death at the age of 42 only five years later. Fortunately, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation recorded their sold-out recitals from 1962 and 1963, and included excerpts on two transcription discs meant for broadcast only--with dates for them to be destroyed. Happily, a small number escaped this fate, and DOREMI is honored to announce the first ever release of music from these concerts. To this we add a recording from the French Radio Network, also meant only for limited radio broadcast. Beautifully recorded, the sound is far more natural and nuanced than that of their commercial recordings. The programs provide a panorama of their varied repertoire, including a plethora of superb baroque transcriptions made by Lagoya--a sonata by the baroque lutenist Lauffensteiner, Vivaldi's violin concerto Op. 3 No. 9, and Handel's keyboard Chaconne--the first two works never commercially recorded by the duo. Sor's celebrated duet, "L'Encouragement," written for himself and his student Napoléon Coste, is given a sumptuous treatment, and contemporary French composers who wrote for Presti-Lagoya are represented by Daniel-Lesur's Élégie.

Fear of making decisions or doing something that you might regret later. The fear of making an irreparable error, perhaps ruining your future as a result, being rejected or giving offense. Not a few people are inclined to postpone answers to urgent questions in the hope that everything will somehow solve itself. But only waiting increases the problem. Psychology calls this phenomena "decidophobia." "Especially as a jazz musician you are forced continually to make decisions. Everything that you do has a direct influence on the band and the character of the piece. You cannot simply trust any mechanisms. It is a question of with which musicians I record and which pieces are included on the album," Krahl explained. For him, it is less a question of fear of possibly negative consequences, the trumpeter assured. "I would instead call it decision uncertainty." This is the current case for Krahl. After all, it is his first album under his own name which is being released in the highly respected Jazz thing Next Generation series. But the musician has no reason to worry. The seven tracks on this release are brimming with bold inspiration, amazing solutions, compositional finesse, and stupendous virtuosity.

Many of the songs presented here are new: they were written by brothers of Taizé between 2012 and 2017 and are recorded here for the first time. Others have been part of the community's prayer for many years. A few come from a much older tradition: for example, the hymn Ô vous qui dans l'obscurité (You who in darkness) comes from the German evangelical churches of the 17th century; the litany Ô Sagesse (O Wisdom), which calls for the coming of Christ, is based on antiphons of the age-old tradition of the Latin Church. These last two pieces are sung at Taizé especially during the season of Advent. Most of these songs focus on an essential reality that can be internalized more and more deeply, as the words are tirelessly repeated. The simplicity of these repetitive forms makes them easy to sing in many situations; but they can nevertheless achieve great breadth and depth, especially when the voices of a large assembly are united with solo singers and instruments.",https://www.giamusic.com/store/resource/taize-laudamus-te-recording-cd1046,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=GIACD-1046&medium=phy,Christian & Gospel,Christian & Gospel,World,France,2018 Ateliers et Presses de Taize,2018 Ateliers et Presses de Taize,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Handel working with Nicola Francesco Haym. With Giulio Cesare, a Baroque hero, Raffaele Pe creates a full recital devoted to the Ancient Roman warrior and Dictator of the Republic, drawn from operas spanning the length of the eighteenth century. With refined musicality and artistry the countertenor Pe approaches roles demonstrating contrasting personality traits of the Caesar who was capable not only of heroic acts but also of compassion, of amorous exhilaration, of physical and emotional fragility. The sweep of the eighteenth century encompassed by these compositions also embraced the onstage heyday of the castratos: including Felice Salimbeni, Senesino, Cusanino, Sciroletto and Gasparo Pacchiarotti - demanding from Raffaele Pe great agility in covering both contralto and soprano castrato tessituras. Alongside excerpts from Handel's Giulio Cesare in Egitto there are arias from works which Pe has been working onto provide modern performing scores together with scholar Valentina Anzani such as by Carlo Francesco Pollarolo, Niccolò Piccinni, Geminano Giacomelli andFrancesco Bianchi.

Conti was a Florentine who worked for much of his career in the Imperial Court in Vienna, generating much attention there - the ever-observant JS Bach and Zelenka were both known to have been attracted by his music. Curiously, it was liturgical works like this 1715 Missa Sancti Pauli which kept Conti's name known until near to the end of the nineteenth century rather than the operas, oratorios and cantatas with which he delighted the Viennese Court and which have hitherto been receiving the attention of artists and record labels today. If Conti's church music is less fledgling Classical than his dramatic fare, there is much in the way of melodic tunefulness and concertato style - for both voices and instruments - to combine with fugal-imitative writing reminiscent of the stile antico. The work is a Credo Mass, with its rondo-like restatement of the word in the Credo section. The tone, control, presence and unity of the Purcell Choir have been amply demonstrated already on Glossa in music of the French Baroque - Rameau and Mondonville in particular - and the singers are given full opportunity to shine in Conti's mass - as are the orchestra, comprised mainly of strings, and the vocal soloists, who include Adriána Kalafszky, Péter Bárány, Zoltán Megyesi and Thomas Dolié.

Very much a favored composer during the reign of Louis XIV, Lalande progressively assumed - from the1680s onwards - more and more of the principal court offices, and was called upon to provide sacred music for the Chapelle Royale within the Château de Versailles. Although the new chapel was not consecrated until 1710, the trio of grands motets recorded here will have been conceived of according to the chapel's architectural and acoustical characteristics. Much detailed performing information from Lalande's time is known today - including number of instrumental forces used and about the composer's later revisions of his scores - and Venite, exultemus Domino, De profundis and Dominus regnavit all receive expressive and meticulously-prepared performances within the Chapelle Royale itself. To the quality of preparation of the CMBV maîtrise can be added the presence of a quartet of vocal soloists deeply experienced in the style of music from this time: Chantal Santon-Jeffery, Reinoud Van Mechelen, François Joron and Lisandro Abadie.

It consists of colors and time expressed in rhythm..." (Claude Debussy, 1907) These words essentially summarize a whole movement- the movement of musical Impressionism. Claude Debussy is responsible for the fact that the newer French piano music of his time came to be highly regarded. After the age of Liszt, he developed in essence a newly independent style of piano music, and gave French Impressionism an exalted position in the field of music. Both of the books of Preludes by Debussy are an expression of this style. The first book was written between 1909 and 1910. The second, between 1910 and 1912. In total there are 24 compositions with which Debussy continued- if only superficially- the tradition of Bach's Well-Tempered Clavier or Chopin's 24 Preludes. Eloise Bella Kohn is a regular guest of France's most prominent concert venues and festivals such as Salle Gaveau and Lille Piano Festival.

All of his music was originally written for multiplayer combinations like string quartets or orchestras and had never been intended to be played using only ten fingers. He writes: "I see Supersonic Flora as mainly a present to myself. For long I had been projecting an entirely new recital programme based on my ensemble works from the past. I made a selection of pieces I particularly liked; pieces I wanted to be in physical contact with; pieces that were playable and would sound great on the piano. This proved to be not so easy. I had to do some serious rewriting as most of the original music had strong contrapuntal tendencies.

Inspired by the travels of Antonio Cabezón, the sixteenth-century organist and composer, Pinnock's programme weaves a path not only through Cabezón's life but also through his own enviable career. In celebration of his seventieth birthday, Pinnock has chosen a personal selection of works that evoke vivid memories from different stages of his life. Success in their respective careers led both Pinnock and Cabezón to travel widely; Cabezón's journeys through Europe resulted in meetings with several of the composers included in this program. Journey sees Pinnock perform repertoire spanning two hundred years (encompassing works by Tallis, Byrd, Bull, Sweelinck, Bach, Frescobaldi, Handel and Scarlatti) on his favorite home instrument, a harpsichord made in 1982 after a model by the mid eighteenth-century French builder, Henri Hemsch. Pinnock's own journey has seen him recognized as one of the finest players of his generation, receiving many prizes and international recognition along the way whilst amassing an exceptional discography; his truly is an epic journey.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=CKR570&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Baroque Era,Lithuania,2016 Linn Records,2018 Outhere,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Together Claire and The Montpellier Cello Quartet create a magical sound fusion of jazz-chamber music that encompasses new arrangements from an eclectic group of songwriters including Lennon & McCartney, George Gershwin, David Bowie and Thelonius Monk. With the connections borne of 30 years in the business Claire commissioned imaginative new arrangements, including Joni Mitchell's 'Two Grey Rooms' by renowned composer Mark Anthony Turnage. Pianist Joe Stilgoe guests on his own track 'Lost For Words' and delivers a distinctive arrangement of Lennon & McCartney's 'She's Leaving Home'. There are also echoes of The Beatles' 'Eleanor Rigby' on a new arrangement of David Bowie's 'The Man Who Sold The World'. Claire's long-time partnership with Richard Rodney Bennett is acknowledged with both song-writing and arranging credits; 'Early To Bed' is quintessential Bennett and Claire gives a heartfelt performance. From album opener via Claire's own hugely catchy arrangement of 'Catch Me If You Can' to the album closer, 'Goodbye For Now', Time and Place sees Martin return with renewed vigour to pop-crossover territory, a trend she championed long before Norah Jones and Madeleine Peyroux made this style an accepted genre.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=AKR423&medium=phy,02 Jazz,Jazz,Jazz|Vocal Jazz,Lithuania,2014 Linn Records,2018 Outhere,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Continuing the composer's trio sonata texture found in Ten Sonatas in Four Parts, Purcell's later set is much more forward-looking to the later Baroque rather than taking inspiration from the old style contrapuntal models found in the earlier set. These sonatas display the composer's innate ability at blending influences from French, Italian and English music; exotic dissonances can be heard alongside the unique use of counterpoint. This recording was nominated for a BBC Music Magazine Award and an International Classical Music Award and was named a 'Choice' recording by Gramophone, BBC Music Magazine and International Record Review.

Katherine stated: 'I feel that Lowell Liebermann's concerto encompasses all the emotions and colours of which the flute is so brilliantly capable and it is for me, quite simply a twentieth-century virtuoso masterpiece, and thrilling to play.'

For his work with the musicians of the Veni Academy, he chose three previously composed works that would be easily adaptable to a large ensemble whose instrumentation was not the result of prior design plus one newly composed for the occasion. The chosen pieces were based on well-defined processes that made use of instant decision-making on the part of both the players and the conductor, and finally, some graphic notation. Composed in 2003 for string quartet, The Dispersion of Seeds uses a simple algorithm of arpeggiation of nine chords throughout its arc to create shifting verticalities. The piece would be different with every performance yet would retain its distinct identity. The composition Flexagons is based on permutations of composed fragments ordered in time with instructions on how to flex and fold them. Augmenting the flex is the possibility of players "popping out" with short improvised statements that may be acted upon by the other players and thereby revealing another facet. The Hidden Variable is a suite of graphic scores originally conceived for solo guitar using "alternate bows" to generate sounds on the guitar. Palimpsest was composed for the occasion and a world premiere. Historically, a palimpsest manuscript could be reused by scraping or erasing the text. While the removal of the original texts might be quite thorough, elements of the original items might still be evident, whether explicitly or subliminally, creating a "palimpsest." Here Sharp's ""original texts"" are sample measures taken from previous scores, compiled as raw materials in this new work, superimposed on the now-erased substrate, the "manuscript."",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=MOD-CD-305&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Avant-Garde,United States,"2015 VENI ACADEMY, Elliott Sharp, Mode Records",2018 Mode Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most of the pieces were written specially for countertenor Andrew Watts, who has championed contemporary music for the thirty years he has been singing professionally. He has established a reputation for being one of the foremost operatic countertenors of his generation and has appeared on opera and concert platforms throughout the world. The two most senior composers on this recording link back to Andrew at the start of his career. His school music master Neville Bower (1934-2007) set three poems from William Blake's Songs of Innocence especially for Andrew, and when Andrew was an emerging singer, Michael Tippett (1905-1998) coached him on his song cycle Songs for Ariel, written for an Old Vic production of William Shakespeare's The Tempest. Colin Matthews has long been fascinated with nineteenth-century French poets and the fin-de-siècle sound and in his song cycle Un Colloque Sentimental uses poems by Paul Verlaine, Charles Baudelaire and Gerard de Nerval. Michael Finnissy chooses German dramatist Georg Büchner as his inspiration, setting extracts from Woyzeck and Lenz. Kings, knights and troubadours are the themes explored in the recent works written for Andrew by Joe Cutler, Tansy Davies and Raymond Yiu, and there is an extra piece by Raymond Yiu; a piano and countertenor arrangement of the fourth movement of his Symphony for countertenor and orchestra. Andrew Watts writes: 'I am indebted to all of the composers featured on this recording for their kindness over the years and for agreeing to be a part of this journey. From a last-minute coaching session at the Royal Academy of Music with Michael Tippett in 1986 to a random drink at Dartington in 2013 with Joe Cutler, this recording also charts the incredible serendipity and bringing together of people through music.'",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=NMCD243&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,,2018 NMC Recordings,2018 NMC Recordings,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Programmed by the Marsyas Trio, the release marks the 100th anniversary of (some) women getting the vote in the UK, and celebrates the diversity of compositional style, the wealth of talent, and accomplishments of living British women composers today. Heather Roche writes: "It is extraordinary to compare the life of Amy Beach, the earliest composer to be featured on this release, and presented on this album as an American 'bonus track' accompanying the otherwise British lineup, with her modern-day equivalents. She was, early in life, recognized as one of the finest pianists in the United States, and performed as a soloist with the Boston Symphony Orchestra at a time when she could neither vote, nor attend Harvard. However, following her marriage in 1885 she was restricted to two performances a year, an order she obeyed until the death of her husband in 1910, when she resumed touring. As women composers and performers in the West, we no longer have to fight to be able to do the things we want to do in the ways that Beach did. But we still fight for those things to be recognized on equal terms: we want to be paid equally, we want to be able to choose to have families without sacrificing our creativity and careers, and we want to see the work of women appear on every concert programme. Women composers are still underrepresented, largely ignored by orchestral programmers, often discouraged from engaging with technology and regularly reminded that their ambition is seen as ugly and 'unfeminine'."",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=NMCD248&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,,2018 NMC Recordings,2018 NMC Recordings,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Released to mark Joe's 50th birthday, this album features six works, all with typically wild and amusing titles that make you curious to find out more. Take Karembeu's 'Guide to the Complete Defensive Midfielder,' for example, a work that combines influences from jazz, contemporary classical, and post-minimalism, inspired by YouTube videos of the French footballer Christian Karembeu demonstrating the importance of short passing and the combination of movement and control. There's also 'McNulty,' a piece commissioned by the Fidelio Trio in 2016, that gets some inspiration from a deeply flawed character of that name in the American TV drama The Wire. 'Elsewhereness,' an occasional piece, written for the opening of the newly built Royal Birmingham Conservatoire, is performed by the Royal Birmingham Conservatoire Symphony Orchestra under conductor Mirga Grazinytè-Tyla (Music Director of City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra). It explores 'the metaphysics of place, of moving from one building as it is dismantled to the new one as it rises from its foundations'. In 'Akhmatova Fragments,' written for soprano Sarah Leonard, he captures the fleeting moods of the poems beautifully. The two remaining pieces For Frederic Lagnau and Sikorski B are named after two composers who have been a great influence on Cutler.

Powerful performances show why Madama Butterfly remains one of the all-time operatic favourites. ''Always at his best in Puccini, Antonio Pappano conducts with passionate sincerity.''

Igor Stravinsky (1882-1971) is twentieth-century music! More than any other composer, he continued to develop his compositional style throughout his seven-decade-spanning career, innovating and adopting all the most important musical trends of his century. Historically, the musical journey starts with one of the first recordings of the recently rediscovered Funeral Song (1909), composed as a tribute to his teacher Rimsky-Korsakov. The next phase in his development is represented with the raw but tremendously refined Rite of Spring (1913), Stravinsky's most famous work that created a scandal at its Paris world premiere, and immediately turned him into a star. His Neoclassical style is showcased by Jeu de cartes (1937) and the Concerto in D (1947), whereas Agon (1957) presents Stravinsky's original take on Schoenberg's serialism.

In 11 songs, including 9 originals, we hear stories of respect, partying, attitude, mystery, sensuality and love. Joining her are three Australian bandmates: multi-instrumentalist Tim Neal, percussionist Mark Gruden, and Johnny Sansone, one of New Orleans' finest musicians. As is customary, Fiona plays a cornucopia of guitars: her 6-string Maton, three cigar-box instruments and her rare baritone National Reso-lectric. Players combine in several groupings, featuring their different instruments, and a collaborative magic emerges, taking listeners along on the journey.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=FR-729&medium=phy,22 Blues,Blues,Blues,,2018 Blue Empress Records,2018 Blue Empress Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The first film is titled 'Manet.' Enjoying exclusive access to a Royal Academy of Arts exhibition and behinds-the-scenes at the show's preparation this film is a fascinating close-up of Manet's works; a detailed biography; and an exploration of 19th century Paris plus fascinating opinions of special guests, experts and contemporary artists. Second, we have 'The Impressionists and the Man Who made Them.' This, the most comprehensive film ever made about the Impressionists, focuses on an exhibition of paintings collected by 19th century Parisian Paul Durand-Ruel who supported this new wave of art. Degas, Manet, Monet, Renoir, Sisley, are among the painters he helped establish through his galleries in London, New York, and Paris. Third is 'I, Claude Monet.' Shot on location at the very spots where Monet painted, this film is a fresh and intimate cinematic exploration of some of the most loved and iconic scenes in western art. Monet's letters provide new insights into the man behind the sun-drenched canvasses- perhaps the most influential painter of the 19th and 20th centuries. Finally, we have 'The Artist's Garden: American Impressionism.' Childe Hassam, William Merritt Chase and Philip Leslie Hale were celebrated artists belonging to the American impressionist movement.

Bach & Arvo Part,Cordelia Williams,1,CD,14.81,22.99,"Somm Recordings and former BBC Young Musician Competition prize- winner Cordelia Williams present two sublime voices together for the first time on album in a poetic and probing coupling of the solo piano music of JS Bach - musical laureate of 17th-century Protestantism - and Arvo Pärt, principal voice of contemporary Holy Minimalism. Although a quarter of a millennia separates their births, both share a conviction that faith in God, as Williams notes in her introductory essay, "is the foundation of the creation of music." This pioneering coupling of the two composers reveals a surprising latticework of connections in their constant, shared striving for economy and essence. Pärt's signature chiming 'tintinnabuli' style is beautifully evoked in three pieces designed to console and comfort their dedicatees: the tolling, melancholic profundity of Für Alina; the quietly majestic and moving Für Anna Maria and the limpid, liquid invention of Variationen zur Gesundung von Arinuschka. Composed for his 10-year-old son, Wilhelm Friedemann (himself later a composer of distinction), Bach's twin sets of 15 Two-part Inventions (BWV 772-86) and 15 Three-part Sinfonias (BWV 787-801) are much more than mere pedagogic primers. Williams finds in them a richness of technical design far beyond their apparent simplicity. Here, Williams reverts to Bach's original ordering of the pieces to chart a subtly revealing way through music as intimate as it is illuminating.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=SOMMCD%200186&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,,2018 SOMM Recordings,2018 SOMM Recordings,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For the Supraphon label alone he recorded nearly forty of Martinu's symphonic compositions, concertos, and stage works, and many of these were world premiere recordings. Despite large-scale plans, this recording also represents both the highpoint and the conclusion of Belohlávek's noteworthy discography of Martinu's works. The premiere recording of the opera-pastoral What Men Live By was made from three concert performances in December 2014. Martinu composed it to his own libretto in America at the turn of 1951-52, and he had a clear idea concerning its performance: "It must not be played 'pathetically', but joyfully... The text strongly tempts one to come up with a very serious, 'deep' conception, but that is not what I had in mind. To me, it is a rather joyful work, and what the listener must feel is not some sort of religious moral (lesson), but instead joy. The moral is in fact in the joy." This recording of the Symphony No. 1 was made in January 2016, and it joins the earlier releases of Symphonies Nos. 3-6. It was part of a planned but unfortunately unfinished complete set of Martinu's late orchestral works.

Eight years after the first edition, Supraphon is releasing this delicacy for true audiophiles. Dvorák's mature works perhaps best mirror the ensemble's extraordinary qualities: the equilibrium between precision and spontaneity, the remarkable ensemble playing, and the solo potential of all of the individual players. At the end of the draft of his Quartet Op. 96, Antonín Dvorák wrote the comment: "I'm satisfied; it went quickly..." Soon after the "New World Symphony", he composed one of the most beautiful of all string quartets while still in America - and the critics were unsparing in their praise. For the Pavel Haas Quartet, both the "American" Quartet and the following Quartet Op. 106, the first work composed after the composer's return home from America, are literally affairs of the heart.

For the recording of the quintets, they have invited two guests: the pianist Boris Giltburg (winner of the 2013 Queen Elisabeth Competition) and Pavel Nikl, a founding member of the Pavel Haas Quartet. Dvorák composed his Second Piano Quintet at his beloved summer residence Vysoká late in the summer of 1887. The famed critic Eduard Hanslick received the work's performance in Vienna enthusiastically: "It is one of his most beautiful works. It is real Dvorák." The String Quintet, Op. 97, although younger by just six years, represents an entirely "different Dvorák". After the New World Symphony and the American Quartet, it is Dvorák's third work composed while in North America. And what did Hanslick have to say this time? "It is perhaps the simplest, most natural, and happiest music composed since the days of Haydn." The degree to which the Pavel Haas Quartet feels at home with Dvorák's music is shown by the many awards their recordings have received (Diapason d'Or, BBC Music Magazine Recording of the Month, Gramophone Award nomination).

Tafelmusik's performance breathes such fresh life into this ancient score that it catches one up in its rare enthusiasm." (Fanfare) Soprano Ann Monoyios, countertenor Matthew White, and tenor Colin Ainsworth are the featured vocal soloists. The recording opens with Gloria in excelsis Deo by J.S. Bach, a festive if rarely performed work that the composer later adapted for the Mass in B Minor. Paired with Vivaldi's exuberant and joyous Gloria, Tafelmusik "emphasizes the legato of the vocal line, allowing the clipped rhythms of the accompanying orchestra to buoy the music along naturally." (Fanfare). With its gracious airs and its lively choruses, Mondonville's Dominus regnavit is a splendid example of the 18th-century grand motet.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=TMK1038CD&medium=phy#,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Baroque Era,Canada,Tafelmusik Media,Tafelmusik Media,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

What we present in this album is our live version, which we believe constitutes an original and truly Latin American interpretation. It was recorded in the year 2005, and since then it was put away, because we couldn't find the pieces that could accompany such monumentality, and its thirty-five minutes were not enough to complete a record project by itself. It was not until recently that ONIX decided to release this version, accompanied by also live performances of works by composers Maki Ishii and Elliott Carter, whose interpretive and compositional contribution was similar, both aesthetically and conceptually. Hard Core requires very strong instrumental skills, not only in the technical aspects for each individual player, but in terms of ensemble work. The recording is a challenge for the listener as well: "hard core listening"- necessary to appreciate and enjoy the innumerable contours of a sound reef full of details and complex refinements in timbre, dynamics, rhythms and harmony."",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=jbcc281&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Contemporary Era,Mexico,Onix Ensamble,Udcmedia,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although his capacity for creation seems to know no boundaries and he composes and performs non-stop, he pours his soul in each project and it often becomes an obsessive journey in the search for his vision. This recording documents the collaboration of three of the most relevant jazzmen in Mexico's musical scene; along with Aarón Cruz, at the double Bass and Hernán Hecht at the drums, Barrera's music acquires a dimension of depth that can only be obtained by years of uninterrupted complicity onstage and at the studio. Each piece in this album tells part of the unique story that is Abraham's own very Mexican life and his Lebanese roots. The title of the album, ""Nasser,"" is a family name, so mid-eastern melodic references abound; a sophisticated palette that blends very well with an evident interest in contemporary sonorities. A production that refers us to the greats, an emerging international jazz performer with a unique compositional voice...

Based in Basel, Dolci has easy access to many of the best vocal soloists around, and this recording has been no exception: the role of the Evangelist is sung by Hans Jörg Mammel, and the other main roles are defended by Gunta Smirnova, Flavio Ferri-Benedetti and Raitis Grigalis. With such a setup, the question of "why a new recording of the Christmas Oratorio" is needed is easily answered. For more than 25 years the ensemble Musica Fiorita, conducted by Daniela Dolci, has been specializing in the performance of late Renaissance and Baroque music. The ensemble strives to promote the current standards of historically informed performance practice and is committed to being true to both the original scores and the liveliness of their performance. The varied use of period instruments as well as the presence of a substantial continuo group add to the flourishing of the finer nuances of the music of the 17th and 18th centuries.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=jbcc284&medium=phy,02 Jazz,Jazz,Jazz|Latin Jazz,Mexico,Abraham Barrera,UDCmedia S.A de C.V.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Equinox for Ken Aldcroft (solo piano) was composed at the time of the autumnal equinox in 2016, and is made up of small groups of notes whose harmonic content is slowly developed throughout the piece, resulting in layers of colourful and sustained resonance. It is dedicated to Canadian guitarist Ken Aldcroft and his family. Autumn Revelations (electroacoustic music for 2-channel playback) was composed in 1999, inspired by meeting Karlheinz Stockhausen and attending his composition courses in Kürten in the summer of that year. Fascinated by the concepts of musical timing and pacing discussed during the courses, the work was composed and completed within weeks of Simon's return to London. A simple waveform is the composition's starting point, which is then transformed by creating subtle, layered harmonies and harmonic shifts which 'bloom' as the work progresses.",https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5n25cMJtWpAHkvtVEKYafQ,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=VOSCD004&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Contemporary Era,United Kingdom,2018 Simon Vincent,2018 Simon Vincent,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During his stay in Italy from 1706-10 the young Handel's eyes and ears were opened wide. Hearing Italian music played by Italian musicians in Italian palazzos, churches and theatres must have been jaw-dropping. Nowhere are those influences more vividly demonstrated than in his early Italian cantatas. In Armida abbandonata the heroine tries, and fails, to abandon the love that has abandoned her. Storms, passion, monsters, yearning, heartache, anguish and finally resignation are all portrayed in this strongest of cantatas. Even more powerful emotions are conjured up in Agrippina condotta a morire. The mother of the crazed emperor Nero is ruthless, ambitious, scheming, domineering, violent and beautiful. Realising that she has been betrayed by her own son, her emotions swing through disbelief, injustice, fury, resentment, grief, betrayal, resilience, pride, self-pity, humiliation, thwarted vengeance and finally come to resignation. Handel pushes all the boundaries, showing techniques that were to be incorporated into his works for decades to come in music of astonishing originality. Carolyn Sampson powerfully captures the drama in full-blooded, committed performances.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=VIVAT117&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,United Kingdom,2018 Vivat Music Foundation,2018 Vivat Music Foundation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

His compositions reject tradition, yet draw on the entire historical spectrum of expressive possibilities. Skeptical of systematic organization, Riehm's music tells stories in sound for attentive listeners, stories that deal with mythical, psychological, and political themes. The two pieces by Riehm on this album evoke archaic and archetypal situations: O Daddy (written in 1984) reflects on the true story of Marco Caruso, a young Italian who killed his father in 1977 and became the recipient a remarkable outpouring of public support. In the course of Riehm's music, it is impossible for the listener to predict whether any particular musical constellation will be followed by rapid movement in the strings, by the electronic sounds of a recorded voice, or by percussive rhythmic figures. Die schrecklich-gewaltigen Kinder [The Terrible and Violent Children] from 2003 bases on an excerpt from the ancient Greek poet Hesiod's Theogeny. Riehm drew inspiration for compositional structures and details of his music from this work and its history of adaptation by contemporary authors, transforming the material into archetypal worlds of sound.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=WER73732&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Orchestral,Austria,2018 Wergo,2018 Wergo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During his nearly seven-decade career, he sampled every conceivable genre, idiom, and national style, and incorporated a dizzying number of them into his music. The Violin Sonatas of 1715 are so wide-ranging in both idiom and expression that, heard together, they constitute a microcosm of Telemann's art. Other recordings of these works often include cello. These pieces, however, were written specifically for the duo instruments -- just violin and harpsichord, performed brilliantly here by and Dorian Komanoff Bandy, violin and Paul Cienniwa, harpsichord. In making this unique recording, Bandy and Cienniwa didn't think of them as six individual pieces, but a single big piece with 24 movements. The Sonata in F sharp minor is a real rarity and this is its world premiere recording. Unpublished in his lifetime, the manuscript is signed as George Melante, a nearly-anagrammatic pseudonym. Comparing the seven works on this recording, it is clear that Telemann had no simple schema, no formula that would produce a single piece of music over and over. These are seven truly distinct sonatas: each unique, daring, and extraordinary in its own way.",https://youtu.be/GO3NP8LdbjY,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=WCS108&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Baroque Era,United States,Whaling City Sound,Whaling City Sound,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The name Hazzan means cantor in the Jewish tradition. It came to me from a Rabbi commenting on my performance of Adon Olam as a jazz duet for the Jewish French Foundation (FJF) in 2008. He said: "when you played, your notes sounded like a prayer. You are a Hazzan on your saxophone". This was 3 years after my father passed away, and since then I have decided to pay tribute to his memory by creating a project revolving around Jazz music and Hazzanout (the art of chanting Jewish prayers). As soon as I started working on the arrangements, it became clear that these powerful ancient melodies lent themselves to impressionist harmonization, and could be enhanced with infectious rhythms from the African diaspora. Armed with these founding elements, I researched Jewish traditions from Europe, the Middle East and North Africa, selecting songs of contrasting colors to paint a mystical and uplifting fresque. In The Morning Star, my father describes a character who -just like me- is a jazz musician from Jewish and Black descent. He refuses to be labeled half Jewish and half black, and claims to be 200%: 100% Jewish and 100% black. I hope Hazzan will do justice to this conception of my Jewish identity as the blossoming fruit of universal cross pollination."",https://youtu.be/Xdr4lC5pMP4,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=yeb-7789&medium=phy,02 Jazz,Jazz,,Germany,werner aldinger,werner aldinger,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
