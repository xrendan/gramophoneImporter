Leaving aside the prestigious repertoire of vocal and instrumental works, however, Les Musiciens de Saint-Julien share with us music that played an important part, first of all, in the daily lives and musical practices of the aristocracy, before gaining much wider appeal among the Parisian middle and lower classes, so that in the end it was popular at every level of society. Everyone in eighteenth-century Paris was familiar with and fond of the songs known as brunettes and petits airs tendres. Minuets, too, their tunes borrowed from well-known operas and their words sometimes changed, and contredanses (country dances), imported from the ballrooms of England, permeated society, appealing to the lowly and to the titled alike. These pieces were not intended for passive listening, but to be played, sung, danced, and experienced on a daily basis, whenever the opportunity arose. Being appreciated throughout the various social strata, they acted, so to speak, as a common denominator- a taste and a sensitivity that were shared by all, in the French capital and beyond.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=ALPHA342&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Classical Era,Netherlands,Alpha 2006,Alpha Classics / Outhere Music France 2018,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As an orphan who had been obliged to learn everything by himself, he retained the deep-rooted urge to teach and pass on his knowledge. His cantatas are spiritual lessons, just as his keyboard works constitute a tutor in the instrument. It was with his children, first and foremost, that he exercised this talent as a born teacher, and particularly with his prodigiously gifted eldest son, Wilhelm Friedemann. For him he wrote the Two-part Inventions and Three-part Sinfonias; for him too The Well-Tempered Clavier and the Orgel-Buchlein (Little organ book); and this extraordinary method culminated in the Trio Sonatas for organ. The cantata Geist und Seele wird verwirret (Spirit and soul are dumbfounded) BWV 35 is one of the three written for solo alto without choral participation and with reduced instrumental forces. The work comprises two parts, for performance before and after the sermon. Soloist and organ engage in a dialogue charged with the elation of trust in God, brimming with coloratura passages and runs. Also for alto solo, the cantata Vergnugte Ruh, beliebte Seelenlust (Contented repose, beloved heart's desire) BWV 170 dates from just six weeks before Geist und Seele. It too features a solo organ part, later transcribed by Bach for flute and continuo.

As the prevailing Calvinist atmosphere at the court prevented Bach from writing religious music, he turned exclusively to instrumental music at this time. But the Prince's chamber did not occupy all of Bach's time. In Cothen he was officially discharged from any ad horam obligations to the church, and was thus able to devote part of his time to teaching. His two Clavier-Buchlein, written for Wilhelm Friedemann and Anna Magdalena Bach, respectively, bear witness to this activity. The English Suites are, above all, suites. Their movements include the prelude, the allemande, the courante, the sarabande, and the gigue. Bourrees, gavottes, minuets, and passepieds appear between the sarabande and the gigue.

Bach: Symphonies & Cello Concerto,Cafe Zimmermann,1,CD,7.79,11.99,"In Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach's catalogue, the music for solo keyboard and the chamber music occupy central positions. In his youth, Carl Philipp Emanuel, who was left-handed, did not play string instruments such as the violin or viola, but rather the harpsichord and organ (not to overlook the flute). It was as a harpsichordist that, in 1738, he joined the entourage of the future King of Prussia, Frederick II, before following him to Berlin upon his accession two years later and then formally entering his service. In 1767, he was offered the succession of his godfather, Telemann, as director of music in Hamburg. He arrived in the Hanseatic city in March 1768, and for the last twenty years of his life, it was church music that occupied much of his time and effort. The symphonies of Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach are all in three movements, quite often linked without a break. Highly original and typical of north Germany, the symphonies turn their back on the style gallant, on Johann Stamitz, founder of the Mannheim School, and on the Viennese style. The Concerto in A major was originally written for harpsichord and strings, but was later transcribed for cello by the composer, likely for the cellist Christian Friedrich Schale, who hosted a Musikalische Assemblee in his Berlin home every week.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=ALPHA345&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Netherlands,Alpha 2006,Alpha Classics / Outhere Music France 2018,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Berlin court of Frederick II was in fact governed by two flautists: the king himself, and his teacher and accredited and exclusive composer, the famous Johann Joachim Quantz. His five flute concertos were derived from a group of seven concertos for harpsichord written between 1747 and 1755. It is very likely that Emanuel Bach himself made all these transcriptions. The versions for flute nearly always date from the same year as the corresponding harpsichord concerto, which suggests virtually simultaneous conceptions.

In attempting to revive in part the musical world of Sir Francis Tregian, our aim was to explore the elements of dream and travel through time and space.

She came to the throne on the death of Mary Tudor, in 1558; Byrd was then not yet twenty. And her long reign ended forty-five years later, in 1603. Byrd was thus the Elizabethan composer par excellence, occupying the same role as his younger contemporary Shakespeare played in the theatre. Though he spent his whole life in the service of the Anglican Church, Byrd was born and remained a Roman Catholic. His prestige must have been considerable, for the Queen continued to protect him and he was never harassed during the religious disputes that shook the country. When he became organist of Lincoln Cathedral in 1563, barely into his twenties, his professional qualities were recognized by a salary considerably higher than was customary. Byrd very quickly established himself as an outstanding personality, thanks to his performing skill on keyboard instruments, his burgeoning reputation as a composer and his charisma with both colleagues and pupils. Many of these pieces are derived from dance steps.

His Marian works comprise liturgical pieces sung during the Mass or the Office, but also religious motets written to new poems. It was probably during his first period in the chapel of the dukes of Savoy that Dufay produced a complete cycle of polyphonic hymns for the Office of Vespers of the principal feasts. Their interpretation obeys the principle of alternatim chant, that is to say alternation between monophonic odd-numbered verses, sung in plainchant, and even-numbered polyphonic verses. Dufay employs here the techniques of composition already in use in the fourteenth century. The liturgical melody is sung in the highest voice but appears transformed according to the principles of paraphrase: the composer's inventive contribution, in this context, resides in the flexibility of the mensuration (often ternary) and the grace of his ornamentation. The other two, lower voices accompany it in a virtually homophonic style. The influence of the improvisatory practice known as 'fauxbourdon' is manifest. In its simple form, the melody of the cantus is doubled by the tenor and the contratenor, respectively a sixth and a fourth lower.

The Lecons de Tenebres of 1680, now lost, probably provided material for the Tenebrae compositions that have come down to us. Although Lalande had written his Lecons and his Miserere for solo voice for the nuns of the convent of the Assumption, they were actually sung- like many of his works for female voices- by his daughters. The Lecons de Tenebres and Miserere must have therefore been composed some time before 1711, for that year Jeanne and Marie Anne de Lalande died in the smallpox epidemic. For this interpretation of the Miserere, the musicians have chosen the version presented in Brossard's autograph manuscript of 1711, in which the alternate verses are sung by three voices in faux-bourdon, a practice that was still in vogue at that time in France. Fragmentary notation for a treble instrument is found throughout this manuscript version, thus attesting the practice, in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, of improvising the countermelody at sight.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=ALPHA350&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Netherlands,Alpha 2002,Alpha Classics / Outhere Music France 2018,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Like most cathedrals of Western Europe, Reims is built on the site of an earlier edifice. The Rouelle altar, on the left in the nave, adjacent to the choir screen, was dedicated to the Holy Spirit. But in 1343 a magnificent statue of the Virgin Mary was placed there. In 1341 Archbishop Jean de Vienne established a plainchant Votive Mass for the Virgin, to be performed each week before the Rouelle altar. The Marian Mass was introduced by Guillaume de Machaut and his younger brother Jean as a perpetuation of the archbishop's wish, and it was for that particular liturgy, which was sung every Saturday throughout the year, that Guillaume wrote his famous polyphonic mass. The Messe de Nostre Dame, as it is called in only one of the five surviving manuscripts, is the first complete preserved polyphonic mass known to be by a single hand. It includes the five movements of the Ordinary plus the four-voice Ite missa est. The Mass is not strictly speaking a unified cycle, but there is nevertheless great coherence in its rhythmic and harmonic languages. The succession of movements shows a broad construction and a harmonious and carefully established stylistic progression, from the Kyrie with its strong harmonic structure to the Agnus Dei with its melodic lyricism.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=ALPHA351&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Netherlands,Alpha 2008,Alpha Classics / Outhere Music France 2018,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He was thirty-two and living in Vienna, a city which had offered him numerous opportunities in the past. Musically, it had provided a platform combining excellent musicians and enthusiastic audiences. In more personal terms, it was the place where he had freed himself from the emotional pressure exerted by his father Leopold and his former employer, the Archbishop of Salzburg. However, Viennese audiences were no longer interested in his masterful modernist compositions. When Mozart composed these, his last three symphonies, he was thought of as a 'dissonance hunter.' In this symphonic 'trilogy,' Mozart illuminates all aspects of human expression, quite independently of his personal situation. Each work presents a different character. No. 39 in E flat major contains numerous elements reminiscent of chamber music, while no. 40 in G minor makes clear references to opera. No. 41 in C major includes formal elements from Baroque music (overture, concerto, fugue).

However, there does exist a declared model for the music of Tartini, at least for a certain period: that of Corelli. His output seems dominated initially by the influence of his great predecessor in terms of both language and structure. The reference to folk music in his music is also obvious. Another interesting element in the sonatas presented on this release is the presence of mottoes of varying length placed next to the incipits of certain movements, and often written in a ciphered cuneiform alphabet invented by the composer. These are poetic quotations, mostly drawn from the works of Metastasio, although not all of them have been identified. At the end of this recording is one of Tartini's very rare vocal pieces, the last composition copied into MS 1888/1.

Aware of that keen interest, the publisher Michel Le Cene decided in 1729 to present his customers with the very first collection of concertos for flute and orchestra. Vivaldi responded to his request by refurbishing several older works. Only one of them was already in the modern concerto form: the Concerto in F major for recorder and strings. Another four pieces were hybrid in form and still close to chamber works. The predominant role of the recorder or flute in those four concertos made them ideal for adaptation. The odd man out of the collection is the short Concerto in G major RV 435. No earlier version is known and its style, more modern than its five companions in the set, leads us to suppose that Vivaldi wrote it specifically for Le Cene's publication. The decade following the publication of op. 10 saw the appearance of a fair number of new flute concertos. Among them, the Concerto in A minor RV 440 is a splendid example of Vivaldi's maturity. Studying the manuscript of this concerto reveals different stages in its composition, as well as shedding light on its destination. In the case of RV 438 and RV 400, Vivaldi simplified many passages, probably making such sacrifices for a flautist of very limited virtuosity.

After the death of Dresden Kapellmeister Johann David Heinichen Zelenka became responsible for the direction of music in this royal chapel, a task at which he worked untiringly with neither appropriate title nor remuneration.

This genuine masterpiece represents a mirror image of the world around Shostakovich: in it he depicted in music the reality of life in Leningrad in 1937 from his own perspective. For him this was the 'worst of times'. After the premiere of Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk and the official denunciation of the opera prompted by Stalin's stormy reaction to the work, the composer was closely watched by the Party… This sense of threat however did not silence his need to compose. He had to find a way to cope with the sense of pressure, and to create new music which would please the authorities and keep the danger of public criticism at a safe distance. His Fourth Symphony had been denounced for its dissonances, its bleak atmosphere, and its ending, fading away into silence. So for his Fifth Symphony the composer deliberately simplified his musical language in order to produce a work that might be considered 'accessible' by the Party: one that would be perceived as full of positive spirit, with a resoundingly triumphant conclusion. One might imagine that such dubious circumstances could have destroyed the talented young composer, and turned him into a Soviet propagandist. For on the surface, the piece appears to be full of orchestral bravura, optimistic, 'happy'. On the contrary, I believe the symphony to be actually extremely tragic….""",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=ALPHA427&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Modern Era,Austria,2017 Norddeutscher Rundfunk,2018 Alpha Classics / Outhere Music France,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In that same year he composed the only two autographed sonatas for flute and obbligato harpsichord. Both sonatas came to us as a step of an elaborative process which could also have consisted of a diverse instrumentation. Such a practice was of inspiration in choosing two sonatas, originally conceived for other instruments, to be inserted in a project dedicated to the equal dialogue between flute and harpsichord. We have no certainties regarding the dedicatee for the autographed sonatas. The relationship with Dresden maintained by Bach in those years leads us to theorize that it might have been the flute virtuoso Pierre-Gabriel Buffardin, a close friend of the Bach family. The choice of the instrument for this recording is due to the eventful rediscovery in 2015 of the only known flute trademarked ""BUFFARDIN LES FILS.""

In the nearly forty years since and over 20 projects in his catalog, Bromberg has established himself as a first-call master of the upright as well as electric basses, releasing more than a dozen albums as leader and providing low-end for the likes of Chris Botti, Lee Ritenour and Michael Bublé. ""This is a record I've been wanting to make for a very long time,"" says the dynamic bass virtuoso Brian Bromberg. ""I love the upright bass. It's where my heart and soul is. My connection with that instrument is unlike anything in my life."" That love of the bass is evident across the wide-range of irresistible grooves found on Thicker Than Water. Across 13 tracks, Bromberg utilizes 11 different basses to create an orchestra of unique tones and rapid-fire runs. Helping Bromberg wield the groove are trumpeter Randy Brecker, saxophonists Marion Meadows, Najee and Brandon Fields, as well as one of the last performances from the late keyboard master George Duke. Recorded comfortably at his home studio in Southern California, Bromberg surrounded himself with musicians he trusts to record an album that resonates with personality and personability. Bromberg's virtuoso skills are in service to the groove and each track moves with a refreshingly funky honesty. ""I hope people listen to it with open mind and open heart,"" says Bromberg. ""A lot of people familiar with me may not be expecting a record that grooves this hard. I think a lot of people are going to be surprised by the vibe and the pocket.

It also offered a revealing glimpse into the outlook of composers in Israel, as well as previously in Germany- even into compositional approaches from many eras he did not live through himself. Throughout our collaboration, Josef Tal proved to be a great thinker: not just an analyst, but also an interpreter who consistently sought to bring out the emotional aspect in music.

Virtuosity is not an essential part of the equation in the lied genre, at least not in the sense of rapid vocal coloraturas or thundering piano passages. The song automatically comes with a text included, and this opens up another world entirely. This has musical implications as well. In Schubert's case, a great poem whose verses convey a striking message is provided with a magnificently sensual musical frame that allows the text to exude a powerful influence on the listener. ""Wandering,"" or, better yet, ""strolling"" through nature is part of the very essence of the Romantic poet, with all his loneliness and longing. He contemplates nature, he listens to the silence, he describes inner emotional states. ""Wandering"" could also imply a sort of movement, but in Schubert's lieder we are actually dealing with an individual subject who is moving, ""wandering"" through the time allotted to him on this earth. We are confronted with a series of snapshots, doubts, and fears. Whenever Schubert depicts the inner emotional state of the soul, he is always honest and truthful. This is Andre Schuen's third album. His first two have been rave-reviewed all over the globe. Schuen counts as one of the young stars in the world of vocalists, and not only participates in the highest level of festivals, but also in the world's biggest opera houses.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=AVI%208553373&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Germany,"2016 Avi-Service for music, Cologne/Germany","2018 Avi-Service for music, Cologne/Germany",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Beethoven's Hammerklavier Sonata in B flat Major, Op. 106 and Liszt's Sonata in B Minor introduced me to new worlds of imagination, sounds, forms, and shapes.

The Sonatas for piano and cello opp. 38 & 99 by Johannes Brahms loom large in the life of each and every cellist. Like others before and since, he tackled these works at an early age. In the Hungarian pianist Péter Nagy, he has found the perfect musical partner. Brahms was especially fond of the cello: we know that from the countless themes, leading lines and heartfelt melodies that the composer entrusted to the instrument. In his youth, he had ""played the fiddle a bit, but my instrument was the cello,"" as Brahms told the Viennese music critic Herberger. The Hungarian Dances, serving as a foil - almost as an encore - to the two sonatas, were written at a time when Hungarian refugees were settling in Brahms's native city of Hamburg. The demand from the aspiring middle classes for sophisticated but playable music, suitable for domestic performance, was one of the secrets of success for the Hungarian Dances.

Born in Freiberg near Dresden in 1746, Doles was a musical prodigy who studied and then practiced law in Leipzig. His father was Cantor at the Thomaskirche following the death of Bach's successor, and there is a recorded meeting between Doles father and son and Mozart, during the latter's visit to Leipzig in 1789. Doles Jr. himself died in 1796, five years after Mozart, and a year before his father, leaving extant only these sonatas and three vocal pieces. The set of six sonatas shares the fashionable galant style of the period, brought to fulfillment by the most musically innovative of Bach's sons, Carl Philipp Emanuel. Four of the six sonatas are cast in minor keys, and their movements are brief and vivid in character, including exuberant minuets, flamboyant scherzos, lightning-quick finales and even a quirky 'polacca' of the kind that JS Bach composed in his First Brandenburg Concerto. This is Jenny Soonjin Kim's third recording for Brilliant Classics, following two well-received albums of keyboard sonatas by another little-known contemporary of Mozart, Leopold Koželuch. Volume 1 of the series is 'an inspired and inspiring collection,' according to the All About Jazz reviewer: 'Pianist Jenny Soonjin Kim plays with an almost Baroque flair well-fitting of the music… The period treatment that Kim brings to the Koželuch sonatas gives them a crisp texture and very nearly tactile character… Kim's performance is commanding and authoritative.

His interest in historically relevant instruments for historical repertoire stretches back decades to a time, especially in the Soviet Union, when such an interest was unusual and even eccentric to some, but Lubimov has always been a pianist of profound integrity who goes his own way without regard to passing fashions. It is in this capacity, as a fortepianist, that Lubimov has made a distinguished contribution to the ongoing Brilliant Classics series dedicated to the complete sonatas of Jan Ladislav Dussek. As he writes in a booklet essay, the two sonatas Op.44 and Op.77 belong to the mature and most original of Dussek's works. Composed in 1799, Op.44 is a truly fin-de-siècle work, not coincidentally subtitled 'Farewell', with bold modulations that cast their gaze forward into a vision of the Romantic age as much as the rhetorical structures belong to the Classical era of Haydn and Mozart. The emotional candor, the romantic impulse and the depressive melancholy in Dussek's presentiment of his coming death make the Op.77 Sonata (L'Invocation') an even more entrancing anticipation of the world of Chopin. For a fusion of Baroque gestures, Classical sonata forms, novelty and expression of the melodic contours, the richness of the piano writing and the boldness in the use of all possible resources of the instrument, there's no-one quite like Dussek, and Alexei Lubimov is a peerless exponent of his expressive world. The continuation of an exciting new project: the recording of the complete piano sonatas by Dussek! Dussek's style is rich, harmonically expressive and pianistically challenging, Classicism on the brink of Early Romanticism.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=BRI95607&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Classical Era,Germany,2018 Brilliant Classics,2018 Brilliant Classics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2018,Brilliant Classics,BRI95634,5028421956343,Sigismondo D'India ,D'India: Musiche a una e due Voci,Ensemble Arte Musica,1,CD,9.35,14.99,"These songs for one and two voices come from the first four of D'India's five books of Musiche, a series containing masterpieces of astonishing originality in the style of monody (solo melody with accompaniment), which had eclipsed the polyphonic madrigal in popularity at the dawn of the 17th century. With a career based largely in Turin and Rome, Sigismondo D'India nevertheless demonstrates stylistic links to both Monteverdi and Gesualdo, and it is the latter's influence which supports new scholarship claiming D'India grew up in Naples (not Sicily) in the shadow of the great madrigalist's free thinking on harmony. That very harmonic freedom - to accentuate key emotions in the text with piquant chord changes - is the hallmark of D'India's own, self-styled 'true manner' of composing monody, adopted from Gesualdo's intense, chromatic polyphony to the solo song or duet, and it suggests a Neapolitan, rather than Roman-Florentine, musical background. In D'India's own words, he uses 'intervals out of the ordinary, moving with the greatest invention from one consonance to the next, depending on the variety of the meaning of the words' for 'greater impact and greater power to move the emotions of the soul'. It is this sense for the dramatic power of song that positions D'India as a true proto-operatic composer. In fact, his three-part setting of Clorinda's death scene from Tasso's Gerusalemme liberata (Amico hai vinto) predates by several years that of his contemporary Monteverdi: the revolutionary Il combattimento di Tancredi e Clorinda. Perhaps the young D'India's wide travels across Italy, absorbing the musical styles at each locale and acquiring a broad grasp of the varied stylistic practices throughout the peninsula in the early Baroque, gave him the conviction to claim his own style as the 'true manner'. In any case, its originality and vision are truly remarkable.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=BRI95634&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Germany,2018 Brilliant Classics,2018 Brilliant Classics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is the work of a highly accomplished musician in his early 20s: already the master of his art as a performer on the flute, providing for himself and his patrons music to delight the imagination without straining for depth and profundity. Unlike Devienne's concertos, which naturally featured virtuoso solo parts, his chamber music tended to avoid excessive technical difficulties because it was largely intended for an audience of aristocratic amateur musicians. The sonatas are all cast in two movements, none of them especially slow except for a melancholy Siciliano to open the Third, which is the only one of the set written in a minor key. Gracefulness is the quality enshrined both by Devienne's expressive markings and by the fluid charm of his melodies. The scoring for an ensemble resembling that of the Baroque trio sonata makes this music more accessible to a wider audience than the trios for three flutes with which the composer is more fully represented on record: there are no comparable versions of these works presently available, making this release a highly appealing acquisition for anyone curious about the byways of Classical-era chamber music.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=BRI95686&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Classical Era,Germany,2018 Brilliant Classics,2018 Brilliant Classics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Early in his career, Antonio de Torres (1817-1892), like other luthiers before him, found a performer ideally suited to his instruments - the young Andalusian guitarist Julián Arcas. The technical innovations in construction and timbre pioneered by Torres enabled Arcas to give full expression to his artistry in works such as the florid Fantasía sobre El paño o sea Punto de La Habana with which Luigi Attademo opens this new studio album. Of the generation after Arca, Francisco Tárrega quickly proved himself even more gifted in both performance and composition. So much so that Torres offered him a guitar he had made five years earlier and kept for his own use. This was the FE 17, which Tárrega continued to play for the next 20 years, and which came to define the sound of 'the Spanish guitar' to generations of listeners. A groundbreaking instrument in terms of its tonal range and sound potential, the FE 17 became critical to both Tárrega's success and to the expansion of guitar repertoire during the 19th century: although he continued to compose using the traditional forms of the fantasia and theme and variations, Tárrega also focused on shorter forms borrowed directly from Romantic piano repertoire. With eight original works by Tárrega, Attademo demonstrates the full tonal-dynamic palette of Torres's instruments. Further selections of popular repertoire by Llobet, alongside his transcriptions of Granados and Albeniz, take the guitar's evolution through a more advanced stage, exploring different registers, radical harmonies and tone-colors. This bold new concept album should attract the attention of all lovers of Spanish guitar. Luigi Attademo has recorded it using an original Torres SE 122 guitar which has been strung with gut rather than steel to further enhance the potential for experiencing this music in the thrill of its original creation.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=BRI95702&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Germany,2018 Brilliant Classics,2018 Brilliant Classics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

So too, in no less concise terms, does the Sonatina of Tansman from a decade later. Dutilleux's work opens this recital, but the earliest work here dates from two decades previously, the Sonata which captures in a nutshell the effortlessly easy-going charm of Saint-Saëns's late music, composed with all the succinct mastery of expression to be expected of one who had never been short of a good tune for more than seven decades. Hindemith's Sonata of 1938 is briefer still but a much darker work, anchored by a grave march-rhythm second movement which perhaps reflects the troubled times its composition. The value of Carmen Mainer Martín's personal selection of repertoire lies in its diversity of styles. Listening to the album should banish forever any notion of the bassoon as a one- or two-note instrument alternating eccentrically between rubicund jollity and doleful introspection. There are three waltzes for solo bassoon by Francisco Mignone, one of the most talented Brazilian composers working in the generation after Villa-Lobos; and to finish, a remarkable set of variations (Ocho variaciones sobre la imagen de un sueño, from 2017) by the Argentinian Alex Dante, born in 1994. This is scored for the unusual combination of bassoon, flute and piano, and dedicated to the two wind-playing sisters on this recording. Born and raised in Spain, Carmen Mainer Martín now lives and works as both a teacher and performer in Paris.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=BRI95761&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Germany,2018 Brilliant Classics,2018 Brilliant Classics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Alongside old favorites such as Wiegenlieder by Schubert, Brahms and Reger, Letizia Calandra has programmed much less frequently encountered examples of the genre. The album opens with two lullabies by Vincenzo Davico (1889-1969), a one-time student of Reger who wrote in a direct and appealing idiom. These form part of a mini-cycle of songs, Ninna nanne popolaresche, completed in the penultimate track. There are one or two older works by Merula and Mozart, but by and large the collection focuses on the 20th century, with memorable melodies and tender expressions by Puccini, Chaminade and Tosti. There are also two lullabies by another lesser-known Italian composer of the last century, Anna Filippone Del Bono. The first was written for the birth of her grandson Lello, while the second, the Ninna nanna di guerra, is a more lyrical piece in which the instrumental part and vocal line are deliberately separate, with a text full of echoes of the First World War and a sense of ineluctable sadness. The delight of this recording owes much to the art of soprano Letizia Calandra, who interprets the individual songs with great intelligence and empathy, delicately differentiating between the moods and intentions of the various composers. A graduate of the Accademia della Santa Cecilia in Rome, Calandra has worked with many of Italy's foremost early-music directors such as Diego Fasolis and Claudio Cavina. 'Scarlatti and the Neapolitan Song' was Letizia Calandra's debut album for Brilliant Classics.

R.I. Mayr's works were influenced by his study trip to Paris as well as the Italian musicians who dominated musical life at the Munich court. Paired with echoes of Bavarian folk music, Mayr's music reveals both a typically Austrian blend as well as very personal hues. At that time, Catholic church music was dominated by the stile antico. Mayr gently expands this ancient art by introducing the concerto form as well as the monody.

Or: a wild rollercoaster ride through the twists and turns of Ludwig van Beethoven's brain. In the front carriage: Wolfgang Mitterer. He has a reputation; as a musician many times he's tormented the big concert organs of the continent in unusual ways, as well as composed for important orchestras, ensembles and opera houses, rocked it in jazz clubs or written film music in his studio in Vienna. Off we go! Radial acceleration. Centrifugal force. Looping. The whole programme. And then what makes riding the rollercoaster so much fun suddenly happens: we can't feel our own mass anymore, and we experience a moment of weightlessness. A similar condition may also appear after listening to this album.

Inspired by the newly founded trio of his Viennese friends Schuppanzigh, Linke and Bocklet, Schubert created two milestones of the genre that surpassed everything ever before in expressive intensity. The early trio movement D 28 by the fifteen-year-old Schubert provides a charming contrast. ""When talented young musicians come together to form a chamber music ensemble, their concerts are worth the journey. To hear the Trio Rafale in concert, no journey is too far."" This is a comment by the German newspaper Oberbadische Zeitung from 2016 on the Swiss Piano Trio Rafale- named after the French word for a gust of wind. The three students from the Hochschule der Kunste in Zurich came together through a request to play the Piano Trio by Maurice Ravel in the spring of 2008.

Arising from the depths of the cathedral, further musical events have been born, one of which is this edition of improvisations for two organs. The other is the 6 Conciertos for 2 organs R. 463 by Padre Antonio Soler (1729-1783), also released by Cybele Records. Improvisation as a creative process, according to Yun, is influenced by mental, spiritual and emotionally interconnected elements, though also by space itself, because space is information: ""Although it (space) is often understood as nothingness or something which is missing, it is definitely not a black hole. It is much more likely to be a container that connects, enables and encompasses everything... ""(Lama Ole Nydahl on space in Buddhism). This, perhaps, explains how the organists commune with each other entirely without visual contact. In addition, there were no preparations or rehearsals for the improvisations on this album. Both musicians share in the joy of wholly unprepared music-making, without setting themselves any specific tasks beforehand. At best, all that is determined is who begins and which basic registration is selected. The intuition in the moment the other organist changes harmony or movement - and even where it's heading - has developed between Jürgen Essl and Jeremy Joseph over the course of many years of collaboration and musical development. Through their common fondness for early music and jazz, they have experimented with improvisations in styles before 1800, extending to the romantic and principles of neo-classicism, thus developing a very distinct language as a duo.",https://www.cybele.de/improvisationen-fuer-zwei-orgeln-in-der-catedral-metropolitana-mexico-city,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=Cybele%20SACD%20061801&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Contemporary Era,Germany,2018 Cybele Records,2018 Cybele Records,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Julian Olevsky was born in Berlin on May 7, 1926. The son of a professional violinist, he began his studies at 7. In 1935, mindful of the growing danger in Germany, the family moved to Buenos Aires. He made his recital debut at 10 and his orchestral debut at 12 in Buenos Aires under the baton of Fritz Busch. In 1947 he immigrated to the United States. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s he performed widely, touring and appearing with the finest world orchestras. He recorded extensively for the American label Westminster. Olevsky had a distinguished career as a teacher as well. In 1967 he was appointed Resident Artist and subsequently Professor of Violin at the University of Massachusetts. Olevsky died in Amherst on May 25, 1985. The eminent violin critic Henry Roth, in his survey of the great violinists said of him that he was ""a brilliant virtuoso, a fine tonalist with glowing temperament and a tasteful musician and stylist."" The complete Symphonie espagnole, including the 3rd movement ""Intermezzo"", was recorded by Julian Olevsky at the recording sessions. However, the Westminster LP of Lalo's Symphonie espagnole did not include it. Many recordings made in that era by other top ranking violinists, such as Huberman, Elman, Heifetz, Francescatti, Milstein and Grumiaux (2 recordings), also omitted the intermezzo. It is now added here as originally recorded by Olevsky, presenting the complete 5 movements version - for the very first time.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=DHR-8054/5&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Canada,DOREMI 2018,DOREMI 2018,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In his own work, Kurtág is inspired by declamative style (without any restrictions) often without division into bars, even when referring to ethnic sources, which remains in strong opposition to the ""Amazonian"" poetics of Villa-Lobos, whose music is based on rhythms which are openly inspired by folk music.

Places are sounds- and this music is Granada. The city was a recurring source of inspiration for Debussy, and yet the composer never visited it; his knowledge of it was gained only indirectly through literary accounts, images, and musical sources heard in Paris. All of these materials served to unleash his imagination in regard to its sound, which according to Falla represented 'the truth without authenticity, as not a single note is borrowed from Spanish folklore and yet, even in its smallest details, it wonderfully expresses Spain'. A common element links all the composers in the present program: the city of Paris. From the end of the nineteenth to the early twentieth century, the French capital was a fundamental goal for many Spanish composers, who at some point in their lives went there for study or work purposes. Born in Tokyo, Japan, Azumi Nishizawa is considered one of the finest Japanese pianists of her generation.

Barja preserves the syllabic nature of the melodies and insists on maintaining the accentuations against the verse. He alternates in them the strophic song, with turns and repetitions, with the simplicity of the popular tune, in many cases with medieval roots, as happens in the Cantiga ""Those who know how to love"" with a 13th century melody. Another bloc groups exuberant Christmas songs and, last, a third and eclectic group, assembles songs of different styles and subjects. The poetic anthology used by Barja in his songs is very successful regarding the rhythm and musicality of these verses. It is no coincidence that, despite the apparent aesthetical and geographical remoteness of Galicia and Granada, our composer chose Federico García Lorca to compose five of his songs. José María Pemán was the poet chosen by the composer to set two of his most beautiful and brilliant songs.

Rick says: ""The healing energy of dance is a constant wherever I've lived. From South African township music to Brazilian samba, the juxtaposition of dance and story-telling creates catharsis- and if you're down, the act of dancing your pain is a force in transcending it. So the dance of chthonic spirits brings out their complement, the spirits of light."" The New York Times described it as ""a bright-hued, vigorously melodic score,"" and it opens his new innova album, Into Light. 'Hall of Mirrors' is also permeated with the spirits of light and groove, merging the tribal with the computerized, employing mbiras, windwands, table, and electronics, which refract the instruments into processed and transformed versions of themselves. Kind of like when you go into a funhouse and see a bizarro reflection of yourself. Commissioned by the Juilliard School, 'Hall of Mirrors' is both earthbound and celestial, dance-like and trance-like, with an underlying sense of rhythmic slight-of-hand and a prevalent- but at times ambiguous- drone. The final piece on the album, 'Into Light,' dates back to 1984, but philosophically it's in the same ballpark as the others.

This project has become one that should garner considerable interest! The ""Ballade"" is Grieg's greatest work for solo piano. Through a magnificent, epic range of variations over a Norwegian folk song, he wrote away his grief over the loss of his parents, his marital problems, and his artistic stagnation. Asheim's organ edition closely follows these restless mood changes, from the lyrical to the triumphant. Geir Tveitt hit a gold mine when he combined folk tunes from Hardanger with his unique sense of harmony and orchestration. Asheim took inspiration from the lush spectrum of colors of the Hundrad Hardingtonar version for orchestra and pulled out the organ's entire stock of creative sound combinations for the task. This selection counts 18 tunes, from the poignant ""Velkomne med Aera"" to the hypnotic ""Hardingol"" to the mystical ""Folgafodne fortel ingjenting.""

Yet his virtuosity on the instrument never equaled his fame, which was eclipsed by the popularity of another great 18th century Napolian cellist, Franceschiello. In any case, the skills of Lanzetti as a cellist were inimitable. He was born in Naples in 1709, and studied at the Conservatorio di Santa Maria di Loreto, the most renowned school for cellists in the eighteenth century, where he received lessons from the greatest cellists of the Neapolitan school. He later moved to Torino, where he became cellist of the Court Theatre, and a member of the Capella Reale. During his lifetime, Lanzetti toured Europe several times. His compositions are exclusively for the cello. He wrote three collections of sonatas for cello and figured bass, a method, some transcriptions, and several sonatas which have been preserved only in manuscripts. Even his early works require a surprisingly high technical ability for his time, and they become even more demanding in his later compositions.

2018,Melodiya,MELCD1002533,4600317125333,John Bull; William Byrd; John Dowland; Henry Purcell; Anonymous English composers (early XVI Century),Anton Batagov: An Evening Hymn,Anton Batagov,1,CD,14.81,22.99,"Firma Melodiya presents ""An Evening Hymn,"" an album of clavier music by English composers of the 16th and 17th centuries recorded by Anton Batagov. The name of this pianist and composer is associated with minimalism and new re-readings of classical works. This time Batagov turns to the style of early baroque, the English virginalist school. Although this music was intended for the harpsichord, Batagov plays it on a modern concert Steinway. He studied old treatises on this music, but following the rules he adds the spirit and practices of modern minimalism and rock music to his performance. In the days of old, a musician could approach musical scores with a high degree of discretion. Performance was co-creation. The same happens in today's non-academic music. Batagov links these two worlds. He deliberately matches himself against ""authentists"" - the 21st century performers and listeners cannot perceive this music the way it was perceived by those who composed, performed and listened to it four of five centuries ago. ""Even the hands that play the piano are not the ones that played the old keyboard instruments,"" the musician says. ""There is jazz, rock, new age, minimalistic and avant-garde pianism in their physical experience"". The musical space of Henry Purcell, John Dowland, William Byrd, John Bull and anonymous composers of the early 16th century, which may seem ascetic and reserved at first glance, reveals traits that so remarkably reconcile this music with modern times and, first and foremost, with minimalism in all of its capacities. An Evening Hymn was recorded at CineLab SoundMix Studios in 2017.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=MELCD1002533&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,Russia,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The compelling strength of this cycle of songs lies in the unity of its contradictions, expressed in the subject matter and the choice of musical resources, as well as a lineup of players from different generations, continents, and musical concepts. This is an album as all-encompassing as life itself, and as colorful and unpredictable as a Coen brothers film. Erik Leuthhäuser is a young singer from Berlin. The various histories and origins of the songs on Leuthäuser's album tell a lot about the man himself. He reinterprets some of the songs, such as Friedrich Hollaender's ""Wenn ich mir was wünschen dürfte"" (If I could make a wish). Others are musical versions of poems and songs, as is the case with a piece from Dorthea ""Dota"" Kehr. We have jazz standards from Wayne Shorter and Duke Ellington supplemented with Leuthäuser's German texts. And then there are Erik Leuthäuser's own compositions. Some of the pieces on the album are familiar, having already been recorded at one time or another. Yet Leuthäuser's interpretations are by no means cover versions; rather he appropriates the pieces and makes them his own. When Erik sings these pieces, they sound as if they belong exclusively to Leuthäuser and his listeners. In the end, it doesn't really matter where the pieces came from or how Leuthäuser happened upon them; now they simply belong to him: ""It's all very personal. I'm not concerned about the stylistics or a particular target audience. I have simply tied all my musical ideas together and created music out of them.""",https://youtu.be/qViULdKKpoQ,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=0211987MS1&medium=phy,02 Jazz,Jazz,,Germany,2018 Edel Germany GmbH,2018 Edel Germany GmbH,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Body and soul. Rolf Kühn finds such opposing forces attractive. With his new album ""Yellow + Blue"", the 88-year-old clarinetist once again improvises and swings his way through uncharted musical territory. ""Europe's greatest clarinetist and free spirit"" (Jazzthetik) plays ballads and legendary love songs on his new MPS album. In so doing, he delivers new meaning and a fresh sound to the pieces. A sentimental look back is simply not his thing. Together with his new quartet of pianist Frank Chastenier, bassist Lisa Wulff, and percussionist Tupac Mantilla, Kühn contrasts his sensitive side with his unbridled desire to experiment. ""I've chosen some of my favorite ballads for this album. These pieces have nothing to do with any sort of trend. For me, they are poignant and beautiful; they are simply timeless,"" says Kühn. ""I found it especially appealing to combine these particular choices with my latest compositions. The album opens with ""Both Sides Now"", a classic by Joni Mitchell. Kühn liked the poetic text, and says that, ""Somehow, in life there are always two sides, but it's best when they enrich each other and can smoothly merge in order to create something new."" One of five new compositions, the title song ""Yellow + Blue"" encapsulates the two perspectives: the flamboyant, the impulsively vibrant yellow next to the soft, sensitive, warm bluesy-blue tonal color.

Berg attended the first production in Vienna of Büchner's play on May 5, 1914, and knew at once that he wanted to base an opera on it.

Out of this environment the unique Danish tradition of the ""folkehøjskole"" (""Folk High School"") was born. The lofty goal of these institutions was to provide life-long popular education, a sense of national pride and civic responsibility for the common person. The movement's chief architect, the poet, philosopher, and pastor, N. F. S. Grundtvig knew full well the value of singing for creating a sense of community, so naturally, a new demand for Danish songs was created. In 1894, the first Højskolesangbogen (High School Songbook) was published. A substantial revised edition was published in 1922, including many melodies by the famous composer Carl Nielsen. Today the collection includes 572 songs with 2.4 million copies sold and is the most popular songbook in the country to this day. The natural choice for performing this Treasury of Danish Song is, the internationally acclaimed Danish National Vocal Ensemble, the elite choir of the Danish Broadcasting Corporation (DR). With two Grammy nominations and the prestigious German ECHO Award for the album The Nightingale, (recorded with recorder virtuoso Michala Petri), the French Diapason d'Or de l'année, in addition to a host of other national and international accolades, their luminous sound provides the perfect frame for these simple, heartfelt expressions of the Danish soul.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=8226911&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Choral,Germany,2018 OUR Recordings,2018 OUR Recordings,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The former is often seen as the oldest representative of the ""First Viennese School"", whereas the latter founded the ""Second Viennese School"", using the classicism of his predecessors to explore new, atonal musical paths into the twentieth century. By combining Haydn's two cello concertos (in C-major and D-major) and Schoenberg's symphonic poem Verklärte Nacht - in the 1943 edition for string orchestra - this album sheds a new, fascinating light on both Viennese masters. The connection between the stylistically contrasting pieces on this album is further enhanced by the inspired playing of American cellist Alisa Weilerstein and the Trondheim Soloists. For Weilerstein, this album is not only a fascinating exploration of the rich Viennese musical heritage, but just as much a confrontation with the dark history of a city her grandparents had to flee in 1938. Transfigured Night is Weilerstein's first album as an exclusive PENTATONE artist, as well as the first album recorded with the Trondheim Soloists since her appointment as Artistic Partner of the ensemble in 2017.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=PTC5186717&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,Classical|Cello,Germany,2018 PENTATONE,2018 PENTATONE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Born in Berlin in 1942, von Grunelius was the pianist of choice for the recitals sung by the distinguished singer Harald Stamm.

The underlying atmosphere is brighter, more optimistic, clear, even a little livelier; there is a constant flow and current running through the work. The slow movement is so full of inner meaning and in my view is certainly one of the most beautiful pieces of music that Bruckner ever wrote. The heaven-storming events, the concentrations of sound and erratic blocks of the symphonies, will be sought in vain.""

In the short period during which the Direct-to-Disc process was in use, in the 1970s, the aim was to transfer purist recordings to LP without tape noise - mainly in the area of jazz - and this produced some recordings that are hailed even today as ground-breaking and legendary.

What clearly distinguishes it from other concertos is its symbiosis of orchestra and pianist. What I mean is that the orchestra and pianist are very closely interlinked so as to give the concerto a thoroughly symphonic complexion. It is known that Brahms originally conceived the work as a symphony. It stands to reason, therefore, that this work should sound symphonic. The task set before the pianist when tackling this work is a very tall order, namely the challenge of playing a 50-minute concerto and, throughout every minute, immersing oneself in the music without losing sight of the overall picture. A useful analogy might be to imagine a mountainous landscape and, whilst enjoying the harmony and unity of the mountains, also to observe their slightest elevations and hollows. I believe that nature abounds in this work, as if I were to breathe in the fresh mountain air, feel its vigor and visualize scenic colors. I have put so much time and energy into this concerto. By giving so many concerts, I was able to thoroughly immerse myself in the music and experiment with it 13 times.

But the biggest impression came to me during my teen years while attending concerts in The Organ Hall of my most beloved and beautiful city of Lviv, Ukraine. I felt like I needed to be there and I was there. Every day for almost three months. From then on, I knew that he will always be my favorite composer. His music is the highest achievement of human civilization. I hear the cosmos with no end. Filled with spiritual love, through his harmonies, the music opens windows to eternity. I was fortunate to become a cellist and so happy that Bach wrote for cello, too. Pablo Casals' inspired my interpretations, and later - Glenn Gould. As so many cellists, I have been studying the suites for my whole life. My interpretations change and I will forever remain a student of the work.""

The music is inspired by the incredible power of beauty, which is part and parcel of this world, giving us meaning and lust for life. At the same time, though, beauty can seduce and ruin people.

2018,SOMM Recordings,ARIADNE 5002,748871500228,Leonard Bernstein ,Bernstein: Broadway to Hollywood,Hannover Philharmonic; Iain Sutherland,1,CD,14.81,22.99,"SOMM Recordings celebrates the centenary of Leonard Bernstein's birth in style with a remarkable 1993 live broadcast recording - never before issued and newly mastered - with the Hannover Philharmonie conducted by Iain Sutherland. Five of Bernstein's era-defining works for Broadway and Hollywood revel in his inexhaustible gift for memorable melodies, his vivid sense of drama, infectious playfulness and captivating sense of poetry. The effervescent Overture to Bernstein's 1956 re-telling of Voltaire's Candide has long been a concert hall favorite. Brilliant, uplifting and thrillingly orchestrated, it brims with memorable tunes threaded together with masterful aplomb. The Symphonic Suite drawn from his score for Elia Kazan's Oscar-laden 1954 lm On the Waterfront is a heavyweight exercise in evocative and atmospheric music, its muscle and menace transformed into a final, redemptive hymn to individual freedom. A decade earlier, Bernstein's first extended theatre music - for Jerome Robbins' ballet Fancy Free - made brilliant use of a symphony orchestra's resources with stylish infusions of jazz-based and Latin-influenced concert music. On the Town pays tribute to the city that never sleeps in an exuberant tale of three sailors finding love on 24-hour shore-leave in New York. Its Two Dance Episodes borrow themes from Fancy Free to exhilarating effect. Bernstein's theatre masterpiece West Side Story transformed the American musical overnight in 1957. With its great trajectory from C major to E at and back again, it carries itself with operatic immediacy. The Symphonic Dances drawn from the score exalt in the power of an orchestra in full, forceful flow.",,https://b2b.naxosusa.com/Album.aspx?product=ARIADNE%205002&medium=phy,01 Classical,Classical,,EU,2018 SOMM Recordings,2018 SOMM Recordings,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For the first time this label appeared in the spring of 1932 bearing the supplementary characteristics of ""local product"". The main reason for establishing the side label was Ultraphon's effort to come up with recordings that might appeal to the general public both by their contents and price. Supraphon now re-introduces this sublabel with the aim of publishing compilations that will please the lovers of the most famous and popular melodies offered by classical music. On the present release, A Musical Souvenir from Prague, experience the magic atmosphere of Prague through the works of classical music written by composers who were in one way or other connected with Prague. We offer you here a musical walkthrough with Antonín Dvorák, Bedrich Smetana, Leoš Janácek, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Gustav Mahler as well as leading Czech orchestras and ensembles. Quite rightly, Prague is considered to be one of most beautiful European cities. Its monuments including the Prague Castle, the Charles Bridge, the astronomical clock of the Old Town City Hall or the Old Jewish Cemetery make the ""golden city"" one of the most frequently visited tourist destinations in Europe.

Initially, I was planning to play music by Bach and Handel on this German instrument, which is based on early eighteenth-century models, but after acquainting myself with the instrument's possibilities, I was led in a different direction. Its sound is located somewhere between Italian brilliance and a more intimate vocal character. Some French builders of the seventeenth century made instruments whose characteristics were quite similar, even though they arrived at these results by different constructions. And so the idea was born to use this sound to retrace the connections between the Italian and French sound worlds of the late seventeenth century."" Tilman Skowroneck was born in Bremen in 1959 and studied harpsichord in The Hague and Amsterdam. After his studies he established himself as a freelance harpsichordist in Germany and Holland. Since 1996, Tilman Skowroneck has participated at various early piano seminars at the University of Gothenburg and the Gothenburg organ centre GOArt.

He is considered the most important German composer of the late baroque era, and an extraordinarily productive musician with an oeuvre of over 3,600 works which cover all genres, including opera. He was one of the few artists of his era who was well respected during his lifetime, and he was able to live comfortably from his work as a musician. He was entirely self-taught, playing a variety of instruments, including the recorder, the violin, and the harpsichord. He was also a great proponent of the recorder, which is why he is often described as the greatest recorder composer. His work for the 'flauto dolce' includes solo concerts, suites, sonatas, trio sonatas, as well as extended recorder parts in oratorios, passions, and cantatas. Of special significance are the ""12 Fantasias for Solo Flute,"" published in Hamburg in 1733, which, along with the ""36 Fantasias for Harpsichord,"" the ""12 Fantasias for Solo Violin,"" and the ""12 Fantasias for Viola da Gamba,"" complement Telemann's oeuvre for solo instruments without bass accompaniment.

In spite of the tremendous relevance that the Neapolitan conservatories had for their very complete musical training, there is no evidence that Domenico was attached to any of them; his family and especially his father took up part of his time in the young man's musical education. Dominico- the creator of fifteen operas, dozens of arias, duets, cantatas, oratorios and several religious works- also wrote 555 harpsichord sonatas which supported the full weight of his fame as a composer.

The piano/voice teacher and Berklee grad seized on the idea of taking Mitchell's material further into jazz and began trying it out at clubs. It captivated her audiences in the same way it did Mann herself. ""Joni's lyrics, combined with her gorgeous melodies, carried on the wind of her unique voice, struck deep chords of feeling within me, and helped to frame that world with colors and sounds and meaning that I could understand and relate to."" ""Full Circle"" reflects on a lifetime of admiration for an artist who has been uncompromising in her approach to music and in writing, and this on the occasion of Mitchell turning 75 years old this year. ""Not only is it really incredible material to work from,"" says Mann, ""it amazes me how universal Joni's music is and how so many people respond to it."" On Full Circle, Mann and her sidemen — saxophonist Dino Govoni, guitarist Jay Azzolina, bassist Dave Zinno and drummer Marty Richards — reimagine some of Mitchell's most popular tunes, holding onto the timeless melodies while overlaying it with an irrepressible swing feel, especially on songs like ""Black Crow,"" ""Big Yellow Taxi"" (from 1970's Ladies of the Canyon) and the haunting ""Blue,"" the title track from her epic 1971 album rendered in bossa nova style.
