Always playing historically accurate transverse flutes, on these albums (which contain trios and quartets in various combinations), he teams up with his brothers Sigiswald and Wieland, his nephew Piet Kuijken and other fine early music specialists. The recordings were made between 1978 and 2014 and are presented together here for the first time. This is an opportunity not to be missed of listening to the legendary Kuijken family in this delicate late 18th-century repertoire. He studied the modern flute at the Bruges Conservatory and the Royal Conservatories of Brussels and The Hague. For playing early music he originally turned to the recorder. Research on authentic instruments, frequent collaboration with various flute and recorder makers, and assiduous study of sources of the 17th and 18th centuries helped him to specialize in the performance on original instruments. For many years he played in the baroque orchestras Collegium Aureum and La Petite Bande. He plays chamber music concerts all over the world, extending his repertoire to early 19th-century music and has recorded extensively."

For twenty years, the most successful of these, “It’s Snowing On My Piano,” has been treasured as a haven of wintry stillness and contemplation. It is a classic album. Listeners all over Europe have responded to it by giving it a permanent place in their lives. So now Bugge Wesseltoft and producer Siggi Loch have returned to the original concept of “Snowing” in “Everybody Loves Angels.” The title is a metaphor for the kind of weightless ease which the music conveys; and this time it’s not just for winter. Wesseltoft is vehemently opposed to the over-commercialization of Christmas, and yet he did find himself attracted to the idea of recording music which would restore quietness to times in which everything is getting inexorably louder. So Bugge Wesseltoft and Siggi Loch met up at Oslo’s Rainbow studio. With the pianist’s little daughter Maren perched on his lap, Wesseltoft started to improvise on Christmas songs and folk melodies.

I was returning to New York after touring with my quartet. My idea: To use three quartets to create a conversation between the world of contemporary classical composition and that of modern jazz composition and improvisation. Autumn would be my theme. Carrying out my plan, I first composed twelve pieces for my quartet and recorded them in Copenhagen. Each piece begins with a different note, generating a twelve-tone row I used in various parts of the compositions. Later, in New York, building on the fluid performances and improvisations in those recordings, I composed, conducted and recorded pieces for classical string and woodwind quartets to be superimposed on the jazz performances. The first piece is for solo guitar. Each subsequent piece adds one instrument, culminating in a finale (for twelve musicians) in which the twelve-tone row structures the entire composition. Among other compositional techniques I employed were aleatoricism, minimalism and serialized rhythms, pitches and dynamics. Always I focused on the beautiful melody and harmony suggested to me by autumn’s permutations. This musical journey begins with the shifting light of early autumn and continues with a tranquil stroll at dusk… The journey ends in quiet reflection.”"

This release is an anthology of five hundred years of music history in a nutshell, combining the intimate sonority of old masterpieces with a touch of jazz by contemporary composers. But in contrast to previous recordings, the quartet has chosen from the substantial pile of five-voice music that music literature has been spoiled with and invited a revered colleague to join its ranks: Saskia Coolen.

Well aware that mastery of his art is acquired in the long term, he has often felt the need to return to the same object, considered from a different angle, when he judges that he now possesses more ef cient tools and can express his musical ideas with greater precision. Although he says he is fascinated by artists who constantly work at the same idea, he does not seek a reduction of this kind for himself, but rather moves from one work to another through a process of reactions. That attitude is illustrated by this new album in which works and performers intersect; and the artists here are the composer’s most loyal supporters. The arborescences and ruptures, the profundity of the multiple levels of interpretation we can perceive in the pieces on the programme of this release, make us conscious of the multiplicity of the levels of meaning present in his music. Michael Jarrell’s training as a visual artist has probably honed his sensitivity to forms still further. The impact on him of Paul Klee’s ideas, notably concerning the relationships between forms and movements, is doubtless not foreign to the way he animates the materials with which he composes."

All this is directly related to the reality of Handel’s situation as a concert promoter. In those days, to earn a living from his music, a composer absolutely had to get his works performed and make a profit on the evening. The idea of not retouching a work to avoid “spoiling” or “distorting” it is a much more modern one. There must be around a dozen versions of Messiah (I won’t list them all). The 1754 version is rarely played because it calls for five soloists: two sopranos, alto, tenor and bass...

The artistic project here renews the group’s ties with the centrality of melody, the dialogue between voices and instruments, and experimentation with vocal sound. The two singers, the ductile and sensitive soprano Caroline Pelon and the alto Melodie Ruvio with her deep tone-colours, appear in both solo and duet formation. A sonata from the composer’s op.2, testifying to the taste for the viola da gamba typical of Baroque culture in Venice, completes this recording, a new collaboration between the ensemble and Outhere that also marks the debut of L’Amoroso and Guido Balestracci on the Arcana label."

In between the poles of preserving tradition and striving towards fin de siècle modernism, Max Reger composed three works between 1904 and 1914/15 featuring a particular sense of clarity which the composer associated with Mozart. Even at their premieres, the two String Trios and the late Piano Quartet each caused a sensation, not least as their compositional complexity, for which Reger was (in)famous, mostly runs underneath the surface, creating an easier listening experience. These tuneful and harmonically rich works which, at times, enter into direct dialogue with works of the past, are rarely heard, even though they represent important cornerstones of their respective genres. The Trio Lirico was founded in 2014 and soon established itself on the concert scene. The ensemble's varied repertoire ranges from classicism through to contemporary music. The three performers are brought together by their passion for chamber music; in addition, all three also enjoy solo careers. It is this soloistic influence within a chamber music formation that constitutes the trademark of the ensemble: the chamber music dialogue is conducted with soloistic passion without neglecting the ensemble's homogeneity.

The result, we hope, should be something special: a rendition that stems from an active collaboration in which we mutually inspire one another. This should not be “my” Mahler, but “our” Mahler…” The Fourth is Mahler’s most transparent and lyrical symphony- almost a chamber symphony. Probably also due to its rather reduced format, it has been received in unique and contradictory ways. Even during the time when international audiences had practically no knowledge of Mahler’s music, the Fourth remained relatively popular. Today it is regarded as less impressive than the First, Second, Third, Fifth, and Sixth Symphonies; from Fischer’s point of view, however, this stems from an unacceptable misunderstanding. Stylistically, the Fourth poses a truly special challenge that the ensemble finds quite exciting. It is Mahler’s “Pastoral Symphony.”"

Ysaye is invariably shoved into the virtuoso corner, but as a composer he is to be taken quite seriously!” These solo works by Bach inspired Belgian violin celebrity Eugene Ysaye to write his Six Sonatas for Solo Violin, op. 27, dedicating each one of them to a great violinist of his time. Ysaye is regarded as the main representative of the Franco-Flemish violin school, closely associated with the fin-de-siecle period when architecture was awash with flowery ornaments. In painting and poetry, meanwhile, symbolism and sensuality abounded. Artists either adored or detested Wagner, who became the main subject of musical discussions throughout Europe.

Back then he was just a junior student at the College of Music and Drama in Hanover. He bought several different recordings of the work, including one featuring the hornist Peter Damm, whom he was later to meet at a master class in Dresden. “I picked up quickly that Felix was extraordinarily talented. He was able to elicit from the horn a soft, warm sound, a distinctly Romantic horn tone,” says the former horn-player of the Dresden Staatskapelle in high praise of Klieser in the booklet text to the young musician’s new CD entitled “Horn Trios”, released on the Berlin Classics label on September 29, 2017. “The Brahms Trio is the pride of the horn literature,” according to Peter Damm, a view he shares with Felix Klieser. That led him to seek out other such works, perhaps even unknown literature from the horn trio genre. He came across the French composer Frederic Nicolas Duvernoy (1765–1838), who was hornist at the Paris Opera, Faure pupil Charles Koechlin (1867–1950) and the Mannheim-born Robert Kahn (1865–1951) who was hounded by the Nazis. The result is a programme of works spanning nearly 100 years of development of the horn trio, which bring Felix Klieser a further step towards his goal: to place the horn centre stage as a colourful and profoundly Romantic instrument. Such a plan requires the right chamber music partners, whom Felix Klieser has happily found: at the piano sits the outstanding and sensitive Herbert Schuch, while the violin is played by the Ukrainian ARD competition winner Andrej Bielow. “It was a wonderful experience for us to learn these pieces, some of them quite new to us, thereby expanding the scope of the chamber music genre in an exciting way,” enthuses Felix Klieser."

Bach: Musikalisches Opfer,SACD,1,15.59,23.99,2017,"Johann Sebastian Bach’s appearance on 7th May 1747 at the court of Frederick the Great is the best documented event in the composer’s otherwise unglamorous career. During the proceedings, Frederick provided Bach with an exceptionally difficult theme on which to improvise a fugue. The King is said to have been impressed with the improvisation, but Bach himself was less so, and announced that he intended to set the theme to paper ‘in a regular fugue’. Several months later the Musical Offering appeared in print – a collection of 13 pieces in diverse genres: fugues, canons and a trio sonata, all exploiting the ‘Royal Theme’ in various intricate ways. Bach’s published score gives no firm idea about a playing order for the pieces, and in most cases no instrumentation is specified. Furthermore, some of the canons – the so-called ‘riddle canons’ – are very sketchily notated, with just a few notes and some enigmatic clues in Latin. The performers are thus left with an unusual degree of freedom when it comes to the interpretation of the work – a freedom which Masaaki Suzuki, with his colleagues from Bach Collegium Japan, is singularly well-placed to explore."

On this latest in a long series of BIS releases with Aho’s music, two of his most recent works are performed by the musicians of the Lapland Chamber Orchestra. The orchestra and its artistic director John Storgårds have collaborated with the composer on several projects, and the Concerto for Soprano Saxophone is a commission from the orchestra, at the suggestion of the Swedish saxophonist Anders Paulsson. A specialist on the soprano saxophone, Paulsson also demonstrated the instrument’s capabilities to Aho as part of his preparations. The Quintet for Winds and Piano was composed just over a year before the concerto and is here heard in a performance by the pianist Vainö Jalkanen, and woodwind players from the Lapland orchestra. The reason for the unusual combination of instruments is that the work was intended as a companion piece to Mozart’s quintet for the same forces. Closing the album, finally, is the almost 10-minute long Solo I for violin, the first in the composer’s series of virtuosic solo pieces for each of the instruments of the orchestra. It was composed in 1975 and receives a performance from another longtime Aho collaborator, the violinist Jaakko Kuusisto, who has previously performed the solo part of the composer’s Symphony No.3 for violin and orchestra."

In a similar way, the last of his 24 Caprices has entered popular culture in a way that few other classical pieces have, its theme reused by musicians as diverse as Benny Goodman, Andrew Lloyd Webber and Yngwie Malmsteen. But there is more to Paganini and his set of Caprices than the one theme, however catchy it may be. Above all, there is of course the virtuosity: throughout the collection, Paganini employs the full palette of violin technique and whereas most volumes of violin studies focus on one aspect of technique at a time, he combines them in ingenious ways. Many of the techniques he uses were of unprecedented difficulty in his own time – ricochet bowing over four strings, octave trills, endless chains of double-stops, left-hand pizzicato and artificial harmonics. But the caprices also display an unusual musical imagination and sensibility – a combination of Rossinian lightness and the sudden mood swings of the early Romantics. Born in 2000, the young Korean violinist Sueye Park has studied in Berlin since 2009.

To imagine what day-to-day life may have been like in the trenches in Flanders is more difficult, however, 100 years later and with no living survivors of the war to bear witness. Poems and paintings can give us some idea – but, as this disc from Steven Isserlis proves, so can music! The main, more conventional section of the programme is a selection of cello works composed around the time of the war, by composers from three of the countries involved in it: France, Britain and Austria. This is followed by something rather more unusual, however, as Isserlis exchanges his ‘Marquis de Corberon’ Stradivarius for an instrument that was once played and heard in the trenches of Ypres. Harold Triggs, the owner of this so-called ‘trench cello’, brought it with him to Flanders from England – other soldiers, on both sides of the conflict, constructed their own violins, cellos or flutes on site, from ammunition boxes, pipes and whatever else they could get hold of. These instruments thus become a highly moving testimony to every man’s need for beauty and solace and joy, even in the middle of a battlefield. With the delicate support of Connie Shih on the piano (and in fact even pianos could be found in the trenches, even if not concert grands!), Isserlis and his trench cello transport us, for a brief moment, to a trench near Ypres during a quiet spell between skirmishes, with soldiers resting, writing home, playing cards – and with the help of the music dreaming of a life elsewhere."

No single movement is more than a few minutes long and yet the sequence adds up to an absorbing narrative which takes us from the 20-year-old enfant terrible of 1920s Paris to the penultimate year of his life, with three masterfully written, unusually reflective wind sonatas. Like his older friend Satie, progenitor of Les Six, Poulenc tended to write music in short, repeated fragments. Unlike Satie, however, the younger man could and would switch moods – from clownish humour to lugubrious melancholy – at the drop of a hat. Like his other compositional mentor Stravinsky, he composed at the piano, and his own fluency as a performer is evident from the piano parts of the many sonatas and trios in this collection. He much preferred wind instruments to solo strings, for their more personable qualities, though it helped that he had a wide circle of friends for whom to write such works. Matteo Fossi is the animating spirit behind this comprehensive set.

Detailing his complete output – from his earliest years to his last, by which time he had almost completely lost his hearing – this 85CD box reveals an extensive palette of styles and mediums, rendered all the more obvious by the box's division into different genres (starting with the symphonies and ending with the large corpus of different national folk songs). This box is the 2017 reissue of Brilliant Classics’ acclaimed Beethoven Complete Edition, with updates including Beethovenian pianist par excellence Alfred Brendel now in the complete cycle of Piano Concertos, Alessandro Commellato on historic fortepianos in brand new recordings of the 18 sets of ‘without opus’ piano variations, Emmy Verhey in the Violin Concerto and Romances and a definitive Mass in C from Stuttgart’s Gachinger Kantorei and Bach-Collegium."

Glass himself remarked that the first book, compiled from work between 1991 and 2012, had a twin objective, ‘to explore a variety of tempi, textures and piano techniques. At the same time it was meant to serve as a pedagogical tool by which I would improve my piano playing.’ The studies of Book 2 (2012-14) are often bolder in finding new structures and fresh keyboard colours. Each of the 20 Etudes handles a specific piano technique, and the two books are united by the instantly recognisable quirks of Glass’s harmonic language and, as Jeroen van Veen remarks in his booklet note, ‘in almost all the etudes, endurance is the main issue to overcome’. Most recent of the pianist’s many Brilliant Classics recordings of Minimalist music have been albums dedicated to the genre’s godfather, Erik Satie and his successors including Michael Nyman and Max Richter. ‘Van Veen’s beautiful and texturally varied sonority, his long-lined sensibility, and his intense focus draw you in,’ remarked Classics Today of the complete Satie box. ‘Sample the Nocturnes’ sustained, almost otherworldly serenity, or the subtle spacing of notes throughout the Veritables preludes flaques, and you’ll hear how completely and masterfully van Veen conveys his intentions, abetted by superb, full-bodied sonics… His fascinating and riveting pianism is well worth Brilliant Classics’ attractive budget price.’"

Again like Liszt, he composed music that was not merely flashy and difficult to play – it tapped a deep comprehension of music history and theory, a flair for the lyrical and the dramatic and of course a vast imagination. Tackling these formidable pieces are eight pianists and one organist, along with the Trio Alkan piano trio and the Orchestra di Padova e del Veneto under Roberto Fores-Veses, on recordings dating from 1989–2017. Alkan’s great cycles for the piano — the Études in all the minor keys, in all the major keys, the Preludes in every key  – feature along side other large-scale works like the Grandes Études for hands separate and together and the Nocturnes, as well as characterful miniatures like the Chants and Les Mois.

Now the cellist continues his exploration of the birth of his instrument’s repertoire with three concertos which significantly enlarged and redefined wider understanding of the cello, not merely as a textural and harmonic underpinning element for another melody instrument but as more than capable of holding the limelight in its own right. Fazio returns first to Porpora, with a G major Concerto which is not so well known as another A minor work in the same genre, but is no less shapely or melodically rewarding. Here already are complex technical challenges which far outstrip anything required of the cello in basso continuo mode, such as thumb position and intensive use of the higher register. Porpora it was who, having left his native Naples to settle in Vienna, took on the teenage Joseph Haydn as an assistant. Under the elder composer’s guidance, Haydn’s musicianship was greatly refined, not only as a composer but a singer and instrumentalist. Thus the present recording presents a very rare opportunity to hear the extent of Haydn’s debt to Porpora."

He had taught himself to play the cello to a reasonable standard (also the violin and viola) and while, as he freely admitted, not a natural virtuoso, he had a feeling for the instrument which is obvious in his writing. This is Várdai’s third album for Brilliant Classics, following the Solo Suites of Bach (BC95392) and a recording of the original version of Tchaikovsky’s Rococo Variations that won a glowing recommendation from Gramophone: ‘excitingly assured and agreeably spontaneous music-making… a superb performance triumphantly vindicates Tchaikovsky’s first thoughts… Várdai’s outstandingly fine contribution marries a gratifyingly sumptuous and varied tonal palette to a flawless technical address – that we shall be hearing a lot more from him I have not the slightest doubt.’"

The project finds the innovative new-music sextet collaborating with vocalist Iarla Ó Lionaird of the Irish supergroup The Gloaming; Princeton-based composer-fiddler Dan Trueman; and Pulitzer Prize-winning Irish poet Paul Muldoon. A modern retelling of an ancient Irish epic, Olagón depicts — not without irony and humor — a privileged “power couple” mired in envy, greed, and adultery, descending into criminality and addiction as Ireland’s “Celtic-Tiger” economy collapses in the early 21st century. Trueman’s score combines elements of the traditional music of Ireland, Norway, and America with the raw urgency and sonorities of contemporary classical music. Muldoon’s text interweaves verses in English and Irish Gaelic, seasoned with word-play and wit. Ó Lionaird, whom The Guardian calls “one of the most dramatic voices in contemporary music,” sings the text in the unique and highly ornamental Irish style known as sean nós. The production incorporates the gorgeous young voices of students of acclaimed Irish sean nós singer Treasa Ní Mhiollain, who also makes an appearance. Eighth Blackbird is “one of the smartest, most dynamic contemporary classical ensembles on the planet” (Chicago Tribune). Olagón is the new-music sextet’s ninth Cedille Records album.

He seems to have been at work on the second book by the end of 1911 and the volume was published in 1913. Whereas Bach and Chopin used their Preludes as something of a technical exercise, composing one for each musical key, Debussy’s were free-form and full of his signature expressive indulgences. Each one has a different descriptive title that gives clues about what was going through the composer’s mind when he was writing them, from Shakespearean dances to underwater cathedrals. What Debussy did in the Preludes and earlier works with a similar inspiration was composing with sounds rather than notes. It is that, rather than their picturesque qualities, that changed history.

Her professional attitude to domestic music-making is decribed by Martineau as ‘revolutionary’ and her early death, within five months of her celebrated brother, was a great loss to the musical world. Despite his enthusiasm and support for her work, Felix Mendelssohn did not approve of her publishing her work – but thankfully for us she defied it, daring to publish her Opus 1 songs under her own name a year before her death in 1847. For many years her music was appraised in the context of her brother’s work, considered as lesser clones of his output. Now that more of her work is known, that opinion has changed thanks to work by scholars including Steven Rogers pointing to Fanny’s Bachian voice-leading in numerous passages, her complex interweaving of voice and piano parts, and more intense chromaticism than her brother achieves. The settings are of spring songs, of poetry by Eichendorff, Lenau, Schiller, Goethe and even Heine who she knew personally but did not like, but admitted to be a great poet.

In her own words: “My concept behind the [album] is to show how close to the human voice the flute can be, and how, through the sound, I can convey the character and sentiments of the arias, pushing the boundaries of what the flute can do as a solo instrument.”"

Despite their differences in musical style and choice of text - interestingly there is almost no overlap between the list of poets set by Elgar and those set by Vaughan Williams - they approach their texts with similar sensitivity and craftsmanship. As a result, their songs are beautifully molded to the natural speech rhythms and inflections of the poetry that they set, producing some of the most beautiful songs in the English repertoire.

Leonard Bernstein would never have utilized the title Concerto for any of his surviving works and concertos make up a negligible proportion of the compositional output of Joseph Haydn.

Both composers are known for their songs and chansons. There are also similarities between the careful treatment of the text, the well-thought-out selection of the authors and the refined setting of the texts with detailed accompaniment. Love and contemplation were often used as topics. Also, both masters seemed to have a chronic shortage of money. Thélème is a professional ensemble that specializes in the performance of early music. The ensemble was founded in 2013 by its Artistic Director, Jean-Christophe Groffe, and the ensemble is largely made up of musicians who graduated from the Schola Cantorum Basiliensis. The name of the ensemble refers to the utopia described by François Rabelais at the end of his novel Gargantua. Thélème is a hexagonal five-story Renaissance chateau built with precious materials. At Thélème, there is no outer wall, no clock. What is the point of worrying what time it is when we are not dependent on time, when we decide ourselves when we will get up, eat, work, or dedicate ourselves to the pleasure of conversation? The name alone says it all: the Greek “thelo” means “I want”, so thélème can be translated as “free will”."

In the context of the Viennese operetta of the nineteenth century, the composer and theater conductor Millöcker is usually mentioned together with the younger Johann Strauss and Franz von Suppé, and he certainly numbers among the most important creative personalities of the »Golden Years« of the Viennese operetta era. His musical oeuvre comprises some 110 stage works (operettas, singspiels, music for farcical comedies – and more), numerous piano compositions, some ninety songs, music for orchestra (waltzes, polkas, marches), choral works, and chamber music. At the time the customary practice was to arrange the best and most beloved melodies from stage works as dance music, as waltzes, polkas, quadrilles, and marches, and such was also the case with Millöcker’s music, including the “Sonntagskind-Walzer.” Its formal design is like the one known to us from the Strauss waltzes of this period.

His second quartet from the period immediately after World War II very dramatically reflects the events of the preceding years. Here Kabalevsky produced a work of extraordinary eloquence with a clear per aspera ad astra arising from the horrors of the war and its end but in no way limited to this aspect.

Des Matrosen Heimkehr was a commissioned work for the Hamburg Opera, but our recording of this romantic work does not draw on the textual circumstances of the Hamburg premiere, during which Anton Langer’s original text was performed. The Italian version, whose translator has remained unknown, is found in the piano reduction published by August Cranz of Hamburg and in part in Suppé’s manuscript score, housed today in Vienna’s City and State Library. The Italian version is also the better medium for the Italian character of the music. The Suppé biographer Roser then was also justified in terming it »magnificent music,« and the Vienna magazine Die Lyra praised the »fine attractive appeal, charmingly enthralling melodies« avoiding the »high-flown style of the grand opera« and mentioned the »avoidance of the shallow and the ordinary.« In any case, the recording represents a successful pioneering effort that once again has found a place for a forgotten work from a neglected genre – the opera oeuvre of Franz von Suppé – in musical and cultural memory."

Colin Timms’ 1987 essay, Steffani’s Influence on Handel’s Chamber Duets, explored the various ways in which Handel appropriated Steffani’s thematic material, contrapuntal style, and overall duet structure for his own works.

Four magnificent orchestral works by Mikahil Glinka are featured on this new release, allowing an insight into his workshop at an early stage of his creative development. The album reflects the encounter of Russian music tradition by form and genre- songs and dances- with the Italian art of singing- the belcanto- which Glinka became acquainted with during his years of travel. As of 1830 he spent three years in Italy to enhance his knowledge of the Italian opera. It was during this time that he met in Milan Vincenzo Bellini and Gaetano Donizetti, getting familiar with the art of belcanto, which he later combined with the Russian vocal tradition thus creating his very own personal style."

On this album the “Georgian Karajan” as he was called by Neue Zurcher Zeitung, shows his affinity to the German Romantic repertoire. Unlike Karajan, however, Kakhidze does not only put all of his emphasis on the sheer beauty of the orchestral sound. He also investigates the disaccords in the music and does not hesitate to unfold it. Together with the Tbilisi Symphony Orchestra, which he founded in 1993, he shapes the character of this music and, when necessary, stretches it to its limits."

His father Onofrio, His sister Antonia and his brother Vincenzo moved to Naples, where they died childless. Ever since, the administration in Mola has never endeavored to make his compositions known. So far, the Township of Mola has named the theatre and a street after him.

Especially Beethoven’s horn sonata stands out of the programme, since it’s the only sonata that Beethoven wrote for a wind instrument. Ifor James was known for his incredible agility and secure high range, but also a broad spectrum of tone color. Philip Jones once said of him: “What fascinated me about Ifor was his ability to play all over the instrument with enormous panache and great momentum.” Ifor left a legacy of recordings, many successful students, and a gift for humor and friendship."

That might suggest a highly reflective program, and the seven performances here certainly convey thoughtfulness. But the true focus of composer-improviser Bourassa and his ensemble, from beginning to end of the record, is in the moment, now. Sensuous imagination supported by sterling technique, Francois here empowers reeds player Andre Leroux, bassist Guy Boisvert, drummer Greg Ritchie- a cast he first assembled in 2002- to embark on an adventure-strewn, winding road that tours vistas and waysides of a collective mindscape, strikingly different at every go ‘round, each listen. The music of Number 9 cycles from melodic lyricism to pure sonics, from a swinging basis to open space, from probing inquiry to fervent self-expression to satisfying resolutions, sometimes conclusive. Bourassa writes: “Continuity is important to me… it is always easy for me to return to the group after a period spent working on other projects. The challenge is to write music that allows me to take another step… it never ends.”"

He began teaching at Dr. Hoch’s Conservatory at just 28 years of age, at a time when Clara Schumann was teaching there too. The director there was Joachim Raff, who was also his teacher. After Raff’s death in 1882, Urspruch moved to the  newly founded Raff Conservatory and taught there for the rest of his life. He dedicated his piano concerto to Raff. His works encompass many genres, from piano pieces through song cycles, chamber music, symphonies, choral works and his comic opera Das Unmoglichste von allem, which was premiered in 1897.

Paul Ben-Haim was an eminent German-born Israeli composer and teacher, leader of the Eastern Mediterranean school, synthesized Eastern and Western approaches to music in compositions of exceptionally fine craftsmanship. He was the leader of a group of Palestinian musicians, many of them European émigrés, who developed a fusion of Eastern and Western musical traditions. Isolated during World War II, this group, many of whom had been thoroughly trained in European conservatories and academies of music, studied the music of the Middle East and came to incorporate its melodic and rhythmic character into the forms of Western music. After the Nazi reign and his return to Dresden, Samuel Dresden emerged as the country’s leading twentieth-century composer of oratorios and festive choral music. Finally, Berthold Goldschmidt was a rising superstar in Germany, his move to England certainly ensured his survival and opened up many opportunities. However, he toiled as a composer, mostly in obscurity, for decades after his emigration. By the late 1950’s he had stopped composing entirely, devoting himself instead to conducting, where he played a vital role in Mahler’s ascendancy in Great Britain. Then around the age of 80, with the growing interest in “Entartete Musik” he had a kind of fourth career, as an increasingly venerated (and productive) figure, composing once again until his death at 93."

Parsons’ work is characterised by rational approaches to pitch ordering and rhythmic procedures, influenced by the conceptual underpinning of visual artists such as David Saunders and Jeffrey Steele. Since the mid-1990s, Parsons has combined these interests with techniques rooted in the experimental music of the 1950s and 60s, resulting in pieces that explore a unique openness in instrumentation, pitch and rhythm."

Often discussed for its stunning array of unusual and elaborate notations, it is all too rarely performed. As this recording testifies, it is a rich, dazzling and mesmerising work; carnivalesque, a 20th-century masterpiece. As a companion work to the Concert for Piano and Orchestra, celebrated American composer Christian Wolff - a close associate of Cage and fellow member of the ‘New York School’ - was commissioned to write a new work for Apartment House. The result, Resistance, was premiered in July 2017. Both works celebrate performance as a unique event, and the openness of the scores produces music which resists repetition. Both works question the nature of an ensemble, how musicians and sounds relate to one another, and the functions of musical form in ways that, like Wolff’s title, seem vital to contemporary life. This recording by Apartment House with Philip Thomas (piano) marks a long and rich engagement with the music of both Cage - in particular the Concert for Piano and Orchestra - and Wolff, whose music they have enjoyed performing for 15 years."

With clever nods to contemporary architects of the New York school such as Ralph Alessi, Kurt Rosenwinkel and Nasheet Waits, the four attempt to erect a more classical structure with modernist leanings and a few colorful yet unexpected twists. Works are still under construction. And only time will tell in which direction things will go.

His first album “Short Stories” is a collection of stylish compositions that alternate between ballads, swing, asymmetrical grooves and rolling rhythms. A few references can be heard from the first measures of Confidence: pianist Nathalie Loriers and above all Enrico Pieranunzi, due to the light touch and his precious way of combining jazz and classical music into something as light and velvety as a summer breeze. But then, right in the middle of the tune, the pianist suddenly heads in another direction, picking up the tempo and welcoming in the fun of swing, running off long suites of improvised notes with the ease of a Keith Jarrett before finally coming, like magic, back to the nonchalance of the opening theme. The rest of the repertoire proves one thing- Martin Salemi is not a man of one style. From Lenni Tristano, whose singularity and exceptional agility are evoked on “Lennie’s Pennies” to the rolling rhythms of “Regina” whose percussive chord-based introduction could be a nod to the bluesy exoticism of the great Horace Silver, we travel easily through he history of jazz."

And Russian singing, especially in a religious context, is a renowned hallmark of the country’s rich culture. Both composers featured on this album were partial to the human voice. Many regard the cello as one of the instruments best able to reproduce the human voice. It is tempting to presume that both Rachmaninoff and Shostakovich were motivated by the cello’s matchless range of expression when each wrote his powerful sonata- and, mind you, with the piano as wholly equal partner. Each was considered one of the most outstanding piano virtuosos of his generation and knew his instrument through and through. Shostakovich’s cello sonata was his first instrumental sonata. Rachmaninoff’s on the other hand was his last in this genre and his last chamber music work altogether. The sonata was overshadowed by the immense success of his second piano concerto, which had been premiered only one month earlier. We find many musical similarities between the two works. Following this glittering period, Rachmaninoff devoted himself to pure piano music, and to larger works for choir or orchestra.

At the heart of this concert is The Rite of Spring. Once decried, it is now a cornerstone of orchestral repertoire and considered by many to be the greatest work of the 20th century. Its elemental nature is best summed up by Stravinsky, who, in an unaccustomed moment of humility, said that he didn’t feel he was the composer of the piece, but simply the vessel through which it passed. Sir Simon Rattle says: ‘I’ve been conducting it since I was 19...it’s one of those pieces that reminds you what the shock of the new is about and it’s still one of the great challenges and one of the great thrills to perform.’ To accompany Stravinsky’s magnum opus Rattle chose music from the Second Viennese School. Webern’s Six Pieces for Orchestra was given a ‘richly expressive and pictoral’ performance, while Barbara Hannigan, appropriately dressed in a blood red gown, embodied the role of Marie in three fragments from Berg’s potent opera Wozzeck. As well as the Berg, Hannigan also debuted a now famous version of one of her party pieces, Ligeti’s kaleidoscopic Mysteries of the Macabre.

Tchaikovsky was a pioneer, his music a new style that combined developments of the Western European musical tradition while remaining distinctively Russian. From an early age he had relished stage works involving magic or fantasy such as Weber’s Der Freischütz and Mozart’s Don Giovanni, and after seeing Adolphe Adam’s Giselle he became a ballet devotee. Based upon E.T.A. Hoffmann’s tale of a young girl’s magical Christmas Eve, as a whole The Nutcracker was poorly received at first.

Rarely staged and the only complete performance available on Blu-ray or DVD, this release is part of Valery Gergiev’s mission to showcase the breadth and depth that Russian music has to over, caputuring Rimsky-Korsakov’s exciting, adventurous and magical work for posterity. This production features a cast of the Mariinsky’s finest singers, including soprano Irina Churilova as Tsaritsa Militrisa, contralto soprano Albina Shagimuratova as The Swan-Princess, and bass-baritone Edward Tsanga, who sadly passed away in early 2017, in the lead role. Originally composed to celebrate Pushkin’s centenary, the full title of the work - The Tale of Tsar Saltan, of His Son the Renowned and Mighty Bogatyr Prince Gvidon Saltanovich, and of the Beautiful Princess-Swan - is indicative of the fantastical content of the opera. It is an old-fashioned Russian treat for the eyes and the ears from the country’s most long-standing musical institution. Filled with colourful music that is typical of Rimsky-Korsakov’s style, it is the origin of the instantly recognisable Flight of the Bumblebee, which arrives when the magic Swan-Princess changes Prince Gvidon Saltanovich into an insect."

On his return he found hardly any traces of the Germany he had left in 1937 and expressed his feelings of grief and loss in many choice songs – some of which Holger Falk and Steffen Schleiermacher have selected for the enthralling and exemplary program on this second volume of their Eisler edition. These songs lend expression to Eisler’s profound love for Germany- a passion hardly to have been expected from a committed communist. He even calls for praise of Germany in the Neue deutsche Volkslieder to texts by Johannes R. Becher, and employs the folk element to counteract the poet’s tone, which at times exceeds the proper limits of pathos, and produces a tender emotional picture."

The young pianist introduces herself with a fine feel for the music’s special colors and phenomenal virtuosity. Although Enescu’s instrument was the violin, he had a remarkable command of piano composition and stages a fireworks show of tone colors on the keyboard.

Ravel’s Trio written on the eve of World War I sounds like a peculiar counterpoint to Shostakovich’s early Trio No. 1, a piece written in a pronounced romantic manner when the composer was a student of the St. Petersburg Conservatory while the Shostakovich as we know him is presented here only hintingly. Moisey Weinberg, who has been usually referred to as one from Shostakovich’s circle, fled to the USSR from Poland when it was occupied by Nazi Germany and lost almost his entire family there, wrote his piano trio at the end of the Great Patriotic War. Bearing the stamp of the composer’s bright identity without any taint of imitation of Shostakovich, this music breathes true tragedy of despair.

The musician of genius played a colossal part in the history of music art of this country and the whole world. Knowing about the range of his activities, the role of a performing soloist and a purely musical domain were too small for his mighty talent and temperament. Nevertheless, there were only few who enriched the cello literature with new works, who changed the view of solo cello art and who gave himself up to Music as he much as he did, for without Music he “could not live and could not breathe”. In the early 1950s, the glory of Slava (a hypocoristic of ‘Mstislav’ and the Russian for ‘glory’) Rostropovich swept the musical space of this country, and ten years later they called him Cellist No. 1 and ranked him among the world’s greatest musicians. The fact that Rostropovich’s art was a prerequisite to the interest in cello shown by the leading Soviet composers such as Shostakovich, Prokofiev, Myaskovsky, Khachaturian, Boris Tchaikovsky, Weinberg and many, many others can hardly be overestimated. This set comprises recordings made before 1967. Above all, these are recordings that were first performed by Mstislav Rostropovich (with the recorded premiere of Britten’s Cello Symphony conducted by the composer among them). Classical repertoire was as important in his programmes – you will hear live recordings of Tchaikovsky’s Variations on a Rococo Theme, concertos by Dvorak, Lalo and Saint-Saëns."

The pianist also performs Prokofiev’s Piano Sonata No. 2, a virtuosic and “rebellious” piece written when the composer was young (his Piano Concerto No. 3 was one of the key numbers of the pianist’s competition programme). On the face of it, Domenico Scarlatti’s piano sonata next to Prokofiev’s piece may seem odd, but the transparent clarity of the Italian composer’s early classicism seamlessly blends with the nature of the selected works.

Oscar Peterson, MPS head Hans Georg Brunner-Schwer’s longtime friend and collaborator, along with Peterson’s colleagues, bassist George Mraz and drummer Louis Hayes, act as the counterweights to the vocal architects from Chicago. Peterson himself instigated the first contact between the Schwarzwald studio and The Singers Unlimited (TSU). Thatcontact developed into a fruitful decade-long relationship; the Villingen studio’s superb technology perfectly suited the sophisticated requirements of vocal artist and leader Gene Puerling. Recorded in 1971, “In Tune” was TSU’s first album on MPS. It feeds off the languages of the two musical poles, whether it’s in the swinging give and take of the opener, “Sesame Street”, or in the switch from the reverential orchestrally-layered choir intro to Peterson’s sparkling play on “It Never Entered My Mind”. It’s the same with the dreamy arrangement of “The Shadow of Your Smile”; in his role as delicate accompanist, Peterson narrows it down to the essentials. Peterson and TSU soprano Bonnie Herman take improvisatory strolls together in the nostalgic Michel Legrand ballad “Once Upon a Summertime”. Two Brazilian excursions are highlighted: In Antônio Carlos Jobim’s “Children’s Game” TSU delivers polysyllabic ornamentation to Peterson’s rollicking waltz whimsy; in Luis Bonfá‘s “The Gentle Rain”, Peterson plays around with the amative choral harmonies."

Gene Puerling and Don Shelton were both members of the Hi-Lo's and, after the group broke up, Puerling became a greatly in-demand arranger. In 1967 Puerling, Shelton, Len Dresslar, and Bonnie Herman came together to form the Singers Unlimited. They were a very unusual vocal group because Puerling wrote complex arrangements for the singers that utilized extensive multi-track recording. Rather than sounding like four voices, they often sounded like 16 or more, forming a dense choir. The group never performed live in clubs and concerts and was purely a studio group, recording 14 albums during 1971-1981. Oscar Peterson heard some of their work and recommended them to the MPS label. In 1971 his trio with bassist George Mraz (who at the time was known as Jiri Mraz) and drummer Louis Hayes recorded with the Singers Unlimited, or at least laid down tracks for the vocalists to overdub over. Most of the selections on In Tune are ballads with spots for Peterson to solo, although the voices naturally dominate. Among the more worthy performances are ""The Gentle Rain,"" ""The Shadow of Your Smile,"" and the ""Sesame Street"" theme. While In Tune (a straight reissue of the LP and a bit brief at 32 minutes) is a minor entry in the extensive discography of Oscar Peterson, it is considered an early milestone for the Singers Unlimited."

As house pianist at London’s legendary Ronny Scott’s jazz club, Taylor accompanied many of the icons of jazz, and in so doing honed his individual style into what became one of the most important voices on the European jazz scene.

It is in this period, in fact, that composers such as Schubert, Schumann, Franz, Brahms, Wolf, Reger, Pfitzner and Strauss turned this essentially popular genre-'song' being the English translation for 'Lied' - into something exquisitely artistic. But for all the importance and meaningfulness of the Lieder production in the XIX century, sings of decline were already evident at the beginning of the XX, due probably to the development of new compositional techniques and to the composers' new approach to poetry. With some exceptions: a number of musicians who lived in Vienna and Berlin and great contributed to the liveliness and complexity of the artistic climate of these cites, chose the Lied as one of their expressive means, thus giving it new life and impulse."

Throughout the cycle, the metaphorical presiding role of shadow and darkness goes beyond purely visual connotations. The ‘beauty of sound shadows’- to borrow a phrase from the celebrated volume of homage to Gerard Grisey edited by Danielle Cohen-Levinas- sublimates the metaphor into an acoustic component running through the whole cycle. Alberto Posadas was born in Valladolid in 1967, where he received his first musical training. Later he moved to Madrid to study composition with Francisco Guerrero. His work has explored the relationship between music and nature, mathematics, and other artistic disciplines. For years he has researched what he calls ‘micro-instrumentation,’ a concept based on the idea of obtaining musical material from the resources offered by the acoustic of the instruments at a micro level."

The Quatuor Mosaiques is formed of the three Austrian violinists Erich Hobarth, Andrea Bischof and Anita Mitterer and the French cellist Christophe Coin. Thierty years ago, while the four artists were members of Nikolaus Harnoncourt’s Concentus Musicus Wien, where they first met, they had the idea of pooling their experience of playing period instruments while also perpetuating through a living link the great European tradition of the string quartet, as represented notably by the legendary Vegh Quartet, of which Erich Hobarth had been a member for three years. In their view, the ultimate aim of any performance is to reveal the inner spiritual richness of the music. “In a mosaic, each element is carefully conceived and at the same time, it is by observing it from the ideal distance that the eye can take in the entire image. The same is true in music: one must work on the details while perceiving the work as a whole.” (Christophe Coin)"

SKY-BORN is Gibson's second album, and the first to be released on Navona Records. She has worked at UMKC Conservatory of Music and Dance for over ten years and will also be teaching this fall at Louisiana State University this year. Gibson's album features compositions performed by UMKC fellow faculty members, the Cascade Quartet, violist Michael Hall, mezzo-soprano Megan Ihnen, and pianist Holly Roadfeldt. Gibson drew her inspiration from a variety of artistic mediums. The piano preludes, which are interspersed throughout the album, were inspired by paintings from Jim Condron (www.jcondron.com), each piece extracting a beautifully haunting soundtrack from a series of abstract art. Gibson also used poems as the foundation for her compositions. The eerie One Voice reflected the writings of the Michigan-based poet Hannah Ensor, while The Folium Cubed is Gibson's response to Luisa Sello's Let Clover Be Aid. Sky-born sets Emerson’s “Music” for four soloists, full of idealism and hope, in the ugliness, and in the reality, something we do not share enough. The 15-minute epic Blackbird carries the reader along a journey of grace and violence invigorated by Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Blackbird, a poem by Wallace Stevens.

The work is based on public domain songs and legends from Kentucky and West Virginia that tell the stories of several “rounders”: rural drifters who include a gambler, a murderer, and a mill laborer who strikes a deal with the devil. Rounder Songs was conceived and composed by Pinkerton and Burke (who are also a married couple) to focus on the common ground between their musical styles -- hypnotic, pulsing rhythms, subtle melodic variation over time, and perhaps most of all, the vivid evocation of certain moods. The work features old-time and classical genres on a level playing field, rather than subsuming one within the other. "

The late Pamela Majaro was one of those individuals. She adored chamber music and its vast repertoire from an early age. She harbored a nostalgia for the days when chamber music in the more enlightened western world was performed in homes in front of invited friends.

Recorded inside the famous Angel Studios in London with an orchestra, this is her first orchestral album in a career that spans two decades and more than fifteen albums.Meticulously produced by Tommy Lawrence and Stacey’s longtime collaborator, Jim Tomlinson, the songs on I Know I Dream are arranged in a way that they transport the listeners which brings harmony and depth to the album and to the stories it tells. I Know I Dream revisits the quintessence of her repertoire and soul with three songs in French (Juliette Greco’s “Les Amours Perdues”, originally written by Serge Gainsbourg, Nino Ferrer’s “La Rua Madureira” and Léo Ferré’s “Avec le temps”), four new compositions and five covers of Brazilian timeless classics including Carlos Jobim’s “Photograph”. I Know I Dream is a majestic and smooth delight, both panoramic and intimate at the same time: a self-portrait with a big orchestra.American singer, Stacey Kent, is an artist who is so hard to categorize, she almost deserves a category to herself. A sublime interpreter of the Great American Songbook, Chanson and Bossa Nova, whose repertoire extends well beyond her jazz roots, fluent in French and Portuguese, she doesn’t so much transcend genre as much as render the idea redundant. Each element of her personal sound is so perfectly integrated that one never feels as if she is crossing any boundaries of genre. Her 2007 album, Breakfast on the Morning Tram, achieved platinum status and was nominated for a Grammy Award®. She’s won countless other awards including Jazz Vocalist of the Year at the 2001 BBC Jazz Awards and French Chevalier Dans L’Ordre Des Arts et Des Lettres in 2010."

Telemann wrote in his autobiography that his method of composing trios involved making the second part just as important as the first, with the bass having a natural melody and harmony closely associated with the two treble parts so that every note could not be any other note than the one it was. He observed that people would often compliment him on his trios, saying they were his “special forté”. The trios in this recording, works characterized both by the composer’s eloquence and exuberance, demonstrate his special affinity both with the trio form and with the instruments for which they were composed – flute, viola gamba and harpsichord - all instruments he himself played. The title of the disc ‘A Concert near Darmstadt’ is inspired by in a mid-eighteenth century painting by the German artist Johann Christian Fiedler, which adorns the cover of the album and which is handsomely reproduced within the accompanying booklet."

Jaime Martín became the Artistic Director and Principal Conductor of Gavle Symphony Orchestra in 2013. During recent years orchestral engagements have led the rising conductor to collaborate with several prominent orchestras around the world. Brahms’ impressive Schicksalslied was written in 1868. The work delves musically into the duality between the “fate-free,” ideal heavenly life and the existence of “suffering man” on earth articulated in Friedrich Hölderlin’s poem. During the summer of 1881 Brahms composed his Nanie on a poem by Friedrich von Schiller as a song of lament and mourning for the fleetingness of beauty.

Anyone who is familiar with the baritone origins of the tenor from Kansas, USA, may well be surprised at the tremendous dynamic grading in the suspended high registers through to the sonorous piano passages that he was capable of at his Bayreuth debut in the role of the Knight of the Swan. He kept that role in his repertoire for more than a quarter of a century, singing it right up to the end of his career at new venues.

These six quartets date from 1780. They are commissioned by the Marquis Giuseppe Ximenes, a keen amateur violinist living in Padua, who had earlier given the young Mozart the commission for his oratorio La Betulia Liberata. The Mozartian connection doesn’t stop there: Mozart heard and admired Schuster’s keyboard and violin sonatas — they probably inspired him to write the six ‘Palatine’ sonatas Op 1 KV 301-306. And, in the 1920s, the French scholar Saint-Foix actually attributed four of these quartets to Mozart, on stylistic grounds. “Compared to quartets by Haydn and Mozart they are very short pieces, with, for the most part, simple, even bare textures, but composed with evident care and imagination, and enlivened by a pleasing, natural melodic quality. The two minor-key quartets are especially unusual. They are designed to be played without a break, and both begin with slow movements of considerable expressive intensity. The music is far from routine, and so are the performances. On period instruments, the Joseph Joachim players use vibrato sparingly and selectively, but with continually varied bow speed and pressure make a vividly expressive impression.” (Gramophone)"

The oldest of them date from the Middle Ages. The mood of the carols varies between intimate enchantment and festive exuberance. We have chosen a variety of approaches to the repertoire, whose many facets invite interpretation either in the folk tradition or in a more classical style. The organ and the bagpipes are cousins, both being aerophones with a bellows and multiple pipes. The organ developed into an instrument with multiple registrations, effectively putting several families of instruments into the hands of a single player. This development made it less and less portable, so that it ultimately became a fixed instrument. The bagpipes, meanwhile, have retained their character as a wandering minstrel’s instrument with its origins in agro-pastoral tradition, used to accompany festivities both outdoors and indoors. This may be one of the reasons why the two instruments have rarely been combined in performance, even though their sonorities go together surprisingly well, to the point that the bagpipes sometime sound like an organ stop."

Sometimes known as the “hymn to humour”, the genial eighth symphony sits as an intriguing gem between the imposing seventh and stupendous ninth symphonies. In a performance described as “light-footed and bristling with energy” (AllMusic), Kubelik captures the work’s essentially irreverent spirit with vibrant and colourful playing from the Cleveland Orchestra. Rafael Kubelik recorded his cycle of Beethoven symphonies in the 1970s for Deutsche Grammophon, each with a different orchestra, earning widespread praise. Although recorded in multi-channel sound, these unmissable performances have previously been available only in the conventional two-channel stereo format. Using state of the art technology which avoids the need for re-mixing, PENTATONE’s engineers have remastered the original studio tapes to bring the performances to life as originally intended: in compelling and pristine multi-channel sound. Other releases from PENTATONE in the Kubelik Beethoven cycle are the Symphonies 1 & 4 (with the London Symphony Orchestra and the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra) and Symphonies 2 & 5 (with the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra and the Boston Symphony Orchestra)."

With his musical setting of Shakespeare’s play, the composition of which took him several years, Verdi also achieved a new level of quality within the framework of his operatic oeuvre. His path was resolute and consistent, leading him away from structured numbers of arias, recitatives and ensembles, and towards the through-composed, large-scale dramatic form: yet without taking a leaf from Wagner’s book! All this based on an outstandingly crafted literary foundation and a dramatic story, in which three extremely different people – with characters ranging from profoundly evil, madly jealous and distrustful, to enamoured of death – take an emotional roller-coaster ride. A ride ending in death for all three. This drama is supported by music that, especially in the depths of the orchestral scoring, subtly penetrates the psyche of the characters, without ruthlessly dissecting them. Music that, despite its magic of its refined tones, never brushes aside the greatest priority of the Italian opera: the human voice."

Richard Strauss, the “nervous contrapuntalist,” had immediately recognized the potential of Oscar Wilde’s play, and had proceeded to add to it a musical meta-plane, which resulted in Salome becoming the scandalous new point of departure for opera in the 20th century. In its vivid psychological depiction of a corrupt world, Salome is, at the same time, both child of and witness to the dawning of the 20th century – a reflection of a moribund late-bourgeois era, captivated by its own putrefaction. The opera hit the nerve of the times. Strauss poured the Salome catastrophe into a one-act opera lasting a mere 100 minutes. However, these are 100 highly condensed minutes, which demand the listener’s full and uninterrupted attention without any break; first torturing him emotionally and then trickling the venom of sweet, seductive music into his ears and mind; laying his nerves bare, then making him tremble in aroused expectation. The new Pentatone album featuring the young, up-and-coming conductor Andres Orozco-Estrada leading the hr Symphony Orchestra (formerly Frankfurt Radio Symphony Orchestra) is a live recording of a concert given on September 10, 2016 in Frankfurt."

Forged out of “iron and steel”, the rarely-performed Symphony No. 2 uses strident fanfares, martial rhythms and clashing dissonances to create great walls of sound to represent the inexorable march of the machine age. It’s a deliberately modernist work, written while the composer was in Paris in the 1920s and intent on provoking audiences. The stark first movement is balanced by the second movement which is in the form of six disparate variations. Containing more subdued and lyrical moments, these variations build towards a relentless march, culminating in a series of hammer blows from the orchestra to end the work with a ghostly calm. The Symphony No. 3 recycles material from his opera The Fiery Angel to great dramatic and terrifying effect. It’s an angry, defiant and complex work which contains a lyrical slow movement, a dazzling third movement in the form of a devilish scherzo and an almost unhinged final movement which starts as a sinister march and builds to an apocalyptic climax of alarming power.  Vladimir Jurowski has recorded extensively for PENTATONE and has received enthusiastic critical acclaim. In July 2017, he signed a long-term, multi-album agreement with PENTATONE which includes a new complete cycle of the symphonies of Sergei Prokofiev with his State Academic Symphony Orchestra of Russia “Evgeny Svetlanov”."

In a distinguished tradition of playing stretching back to the great Russian school of Scriabin, Rachmaninov and Medtner through her teacher, the acclaimed virtuoso Alexander Goldenweiser, Nelly Akopian-Tamarina is an exemplar of an exquisitely crafted and poetical style of playing which is subtle, probing, deeply lyrical and utterly spellbinding. Winner of the 1963 Robert Schumann International Competition for Pianists and Singers and recipient of the coveted Robert Schumann Prize in 1974, her career was nevertheless blocked by official censorship in the Soviet Union during the 1970s such that she made her London debut only in 1983 with a programme of Schumann and Brahms. For this new release, Akopian-Tamarina approaches the programme with her customary sensitivity and poetic insights to give performances of rare subtlety and perfection. “Classically framed romantic miniature fantasies, intricate, entwining studies in embroidery, decoration and voicing”, she writes of the Variations and Fugue on a Theme of Handel, “the twenty-five variations navigate the theme to a coronation of fugal triumph, immeasurable and immortal”.

David Ian’s delightful performances transport you to an era that birthed the most sentimental songs of this season. The opener, “Deck the Halls” welcomes in the Christmas spirit with a swinging trio. David Ian’s signature sound shines throughout the album as he transforms the often stately “Joy to the World” into a jazz/blues injected festivity and then carries the listener into a dreamier state with the ever-loved classic “White Christmas.” The lyrical bass solos of Jon Estes tastefully splash their way on numerous tracks supported by the clever drumwork of Josh Hunt, who together comprise a perfectly ornamental rhythm section. “We Three Kings” takes on a new form with a reflective mood; an unexpected arrangement of a Christmas classic, more forgotten in recent years. In “Silver Bells,” Ian masterfully and fluidly switches back and forth from swing to straight time. The close of the album is a solemn “O Come, All Ye Faithful,” stripped down to just piano and percussion. If you listen closely, your ears might catch the chirps of a winter bird complementing this moving musical performance."

The works integrate traditional instruments with live electronic processing and sound files. Biggs’ compositions focus on environmental, political, and scientific extra-musical concepts relevant to today’s world. Featuring the Western Brass Quintet, the title track, Decade Zero explores the last period in time when humanity can take decisive action to combat climate change without facing irrevocable changes to our world. Externalities, for amplified cello and electronics, balances a consumer attempting to minimize the negative outcomes of their consumption choices while reflecting on participatory economics. Amass, for clarinet and electronics, has origins in the Arab Spring movement and Occupy Wall Street. It reflects on contemporary society’s desire for meaningful change through continuous stratifying and blending of music. Biggs’ more abstract works, such as the Decoherence for trumpet and electronics, refer to concepts of quantum physics, and Recombinant Serenade features variations on the “Prologue” from Benjamin Britten’s Serenade for tenor, horn, and strings. The common themes between these works include the anxieties of decision-making, often represented with instrumental parts, and the range of resulting consequences, generally represented by the electronics.

Thanks to the organization of the railway company, he was able to retire to devote himself exclusively to music.

Ib Lund Nielsen was a bit older and with some experience from other groups. When we, quite randomly, met each other, it did not take long for us to realize that we shared a mutual pulse, a comfort – a faith, that the music stood by itself. It was new and weirdly wordless. We didn’t even know how special it was, because we were completely focused on creative development. And the problems and challenges that come with it. I myself was equally drawn towards fixing and tearing apart.  But looking back, with so much experienced, so much played and heard, it’s clear to me, that this collaboration was the ‘approach to the music´.

Many hundreds of string quartets and other chamber works have been written for the ensemble since its foundation by first violinist Irvine Arditti in 1974. Many of these works have left a permanent mark on 20th century repertoire and have given the Arditti Quartet a firm place in music history. World premieres of quartets by composers such as Abrahamsen, Ades, Andriessen, Aperghis, Birtwistle, Britten, Cage, Rihm, Scelsi, Sciarrino, Stockhausen and Xenakis and hundreds more show the wide range of music in the Arditti Quartet’s repertoire. The ensemble believes that close collaboration with composers is vital to the process of interpreting modern music and therefore attempts to work with every composer it plays. The players’ commitment to educational work is indicated by their masterclasses and workshops for young performers and composers all over the world."

The two composers also had a relationship as a teacher and pupil. Novak referred to his studies with Martinu in New York in 1947 as having had a major impact on his development as a music creator and human. Martinu’s influence is palpable in Novak’s Philharmonic Dances (Choreae Philharmonicae, 1956), three symphonic fantasies that provide wide scope for showcasing the virtuosity of both the soloists and the groups of instruments. The present recording of the work (the very first made in a studio) helps us to pay off our great debt to Novak, an artist who gave preference to being a “free exile” against having to breathe the oppressive air in his homeland, reigned over by a dictatorial regime. The album’s centrepiece is a new account of Martinu’s Bouquet of Flowers, a landmark recording of which was made in 1955 by Karel Ancerl, conducting the Czech Philharmonic. The composer never got to hear the piece performed in public yet he had the chance to listen to the gramophone record sent to him at his friend’s house at Schönenberg, where he had found a temporary home. Some 60 years later, the Bouquet of Flowers has now been let blossom in its entire beauty by Tomaš Netopil, one of the most distinguished contemporary Czech conductors. Drawing upon traditional Moravian songs as the major and irreplaceable source of inspiration, one that had a marked influence on his singular musical idiom, Martinu solely based his Bouquet of Flowers on folk ballads – and the performers have duly approached it with the loving care and tenderness of seasoned gardeners."

Like all his other music, his choral works were meant to be true to real life and clearly understood by an audience. This was a fundamental diference between Henze and other composers who were active after the Second World War. While he did indeed use the same compositional techniques as his colleagues- dodecaphony, serial composition, neo-classical tonal colors- he always considered traditional forms of expression. The three choral works on this album date from 1947, 1963, and 1978. Even here, the music reflects traditional elements of western music. In recording these pieces, the SWR Vokalensemble Stuttgrt and the Ensemble Modern again make a key contribution to the music of an important German composer, alongside representative works by other composers such as Charles Ives, Elliott Carter, Heitor Villa-Lobos, and many more that have already been recorded by this first-class choir."

This astonishing cycle takes the listener into such distant moods, that even after the first variation it doesn't matter what the theme is, it is all so unmistakably Beethoven. Also on this disc, two cycles of ""simple"" piano pieces entitled ""Bagatelles"". Small, unimportant things, trivialities, which make you think involuntarily of much later romantic composers. And finally, the usually so self-critical Beethoven allocated his penultimate opus number (op. 134) to a ""simple"" piano score of the ""GroÃŸe Fuge"" op. 133. So how does all this fit together? Obviously, the scope of classical forms was too narrow for Beethoven. Did this apparent simplicity serve a wider purpose? The very last movement of the very last opus, the string quartet op. 135, is based on the text ""Must it be? - It must be! "" Was Beethoven in his last works pursuing an overall objective? Or did it all just happen like that? You can find these last works for piano alongside each other on this release. Just listen to the first few seconds of the ""Große Fuge"" with Ljupka Hadzigeorgiewa and Evgeni Koroliov.

But there is a history of work, and whoever wants to come to Bach’s only self-contained version must go to the earlier possible version. Bach’s Art of the Fugue is a collection of polyphonic pieces developed from a single main theme. The well-known and recent version was completed by Bach’s son, Carl Philipp Emanuel, after his death. This release, however, shows an even earlier version believed to be done entirely by Bach.

As a solo work, it is called “Metapiece."" It can also, however, be played together – either simultaneously or in alternation – with other pieces by Kagel or other living composers, and is then called Mimetics. In this way, Kagel opens at the conceptual level various possibilities for the interpreter to realize his composition. The pianist Sabine Liebner has accepted Kagel’s invitation to collaborate and undertaken her own musical journey through the composer’s piano music. Sabine Liebner‘s response to his invitation to play with the idea of open form is unique in that she combines “Metapiece” exclusively with other piano pieces, all of them composed by Kagel himself. “Metapiece”, in its “Mimetics” form, surrounds these other works or is laid over them. Framed by “Mimetics”, the “Cuatro piezas para piano” and “MM 51” are played in their original forms, and the piano etude “An Tasten” is subverted by a version of “Mimetics”. At the end of Liebner’s response to Kagel’s original invitation, “Metapiece” itself appears in a 20-minute solo version."

One important element in this context is the interpretational freedom of the performers, who can adjust the musical text to their own inner state or rhythm. “ASLSP” stands for “As Slow aS Possible.” Other than this, the interpreter is free to choose the tempo, as well as the registration and dynamics. Toshio Hosokawa employs Japanese aesthetic principles using both Western and traditional Japanese instruments and ensembles, in the process bringing the sounds of the two traditions into closer proximity. Dominik Susteck creates bridges to the otherwise very different music of Cage and Hosokawa on behalf of three improvisations in the church “Kunst-Station Sankt Peter” in Cologne/Germany, pieces that are conceived spatially, first of all through the literal movement of the sounds throughout the performing space, but primarily because the progression of sound impulses suggests various sound spaces, sonic landscapes, and a distinct sense of foreground and background."

He recently inherited the venerable post of Music Director of the Pacific Chorale, led by the eminent John Alexander since 1972. Rob Istad planned this recording and the repertoire for their tour carefully. This is church music from the sacred traditions in Europe, Russia and the Americas. The University Singers gave this concert in four beautiful houses of worship in Vasterås, Tallinn, Helsinki and St. Petersburg. Rob wanted to take the best American choral tradition on tour, and take home music by composers from these areas. Rob talked about how important it was to “connect each student to the culture of the places they would visit through the repertoire,” while he also acknowledged that “European audiences expect American choirs to bring music from their own folk tradition.” Herbert Howells’ Requiem and Brahms’ Op. 29 motet served as the foundation stones of the program. Even though it is a mass for the dead, it celebrates life through its promise of the peace that comes through faith, contemplation and acceptance. This performance, anything but morbid, emphasizes the Requiem’s transcendence, its reassurance, and its foretelling of eternal light. Howells’ inclusion of Psalms 23 and 121 in the Requiem encouraged Rob to balance them with Brahms’ setting of Psalm 51 in the Op. 29 motet."

For many composers, the introduction of jazz at the beginning of the twentieth century in Europe did not go unnoticed. The spontaneity of the new music, the new sound possibilities, the vital rhythms, the refined, swinging rubato – and improvisation, inseparably integrated with jazz – they were all features which speak to the imagination. The influence of jazz became audible in symphonic repertoire as well as in chamber music. Although in jazz itself, the violin had never taken a prominent place, many composers chose the instrument for their jazz-inspired works. Even though an essential element of jazz – improvisation – is missing in their music, other elements justify the term “jazzy”: the lively rhythms, the free and whimsical melody lines and above all a light-hearted kind of energy, which mirrors the innovative and optimistic spirit of the Interbellum years."
