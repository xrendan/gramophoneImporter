These interactions with artistic models from earlier times result in three highly individual compositions, each appealing both to the heart and to the mind. The tentative beginnings of the duo partnership of Bard Monsen and Gunnar Flagstad took place in the autumn of 1999, when they met at the Barratt Due Institute of Music in Oslo- Gunnar as the newly-appointed accompanist for string players at the institute, and Bard studying the violin with Alf Richard Kraggerud and Stephan Barratt-Due. Bard later moved to the US to study with the legendary violin pedagogue Mauricio Fuks, but he continued to meet up with Gunnar at different musical events. It was a particularly successful concert at a festival in 2014, where they played Lutoslawski’s Partita, that served as the catalyst for a more regular musical partnership. This led to a thorough perusal of the 20th century duet repertoire, and the present recording in which three iconic works from a profoundly fascinating period in music history interact with each other is the fruition of this perusal."

Nielsen and Sibelius were both inspired and influenced in their early years by Grieg’s music. Their idiom was strongly Romantic, but they managed to create a distinct “Nordic Sound” in which national elements combined with the broader European tradition. This album not only shows this, but also probes the way they were inspired by one another. Moreover, the works on this release are among the artists’ personal favorites, with a Northern Timbre they feel resonates, no matter where you are. Ragnhild Hemsing and Tor Espen Aspaas began playing as regular recital partners in 2010 in preparation for the recording of Ragnhild’s debut album, which featured works by Norwegian composers in addition to traditional folk music played on a Hardanger fiddle. This musical partnership has subsequently been consolidated with numerous concerts, tours, recordings and broadcasts both in and outside of Norway. The two musicians have also guested each other’s chamber music festivals-respectively the Hemsing Festival in Aurdal/Valdres and the Winter Chamber Music Festival in Roros- and collaborated on new projects as part of the festival programmes."

Praise of the beauty of nature and eternal life are the subjects of the sacred poems by his contemporary Barthold Heinrich Brockes which Handel set to music in his ""Nine German Arias"". Each of the arias celebrates an aspect of nature – from the beauty of a flaming rose to the sweetness of silence – with extraordinary tenderness and sincerity. In these nine pieces for soprano and a small group of instruments, to be chosen at will, Handel drew in many places on music from his own operas, with the voice part in the German arias adapted to be less virtuosic and more deeply expressive. The musical relationships with Handel’s opera arias are evident in the endless ingenuity of his characterization and the expressive, articulate melodies with which the soprano and the violin obbligato create their vivid images. The young German soprano Marie Friederike Schöder is accompanied in her beautiful interpretation of the arias by the specialist ensemble Batzdorfer Hofkapelle."

Those in D (K285) and G (K285a) are probably products of a Mannheim commission, while the C major (K285b) and A major (K298) Quartets belong to the early to mid-1780s when Mozart was in Vienna. Mozart’s flute quartets are central to the classical flute repertoire. The fact that Mozart held the instrument in rather low regard did not stop him from writing some of his loveliest music for it. The composer’s characteristic charm, wit, beauty, and elegance are in evidence throughout. The flute imposed itself undeniably as solo instrument in these scores imbued with concertante writing and the gallant style characteristic of the taste of the Mannheim court at that time. The present recording with Barthold Kuijken dated from the early 1980s and is regarded as one the most beautiful interpretations of these works."

The evidence for Joshua Rifkin’s hypothesis of single voices is found among the sources of these works. Bach’s motets have featured rather less in the debate. For those wanting a general “choral” approach, La Petite Bande and Sigiswald Kuijken present on their recording from the early 1990s an alternative to the authentic early performance style. La Petite Bande was founded in 1972 by Sigiswald Kuijken at the request of the record company Harmonia Mundi in order to record Lully’s “Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme,” under the direction of Gustav Leonhardt. The orchestra takes its name and constitution from Lully’s own orchestra at the court of Louis XIV. All its members are internationally renowned specialists in the early music field. La Petite Bande has recorded instrumental as well as vocal music, including operas and oratorios from the Baroque and Classical periods. La Petite Bande currently makes recordings for Accent, Challenge, Deutsche Harmonia Mundi, Denon, Seon/Virgin and Hyperion."

Blomstedt's interpretations of Beethoven are based on a highly responsible handling of the scores and this conductor’s deep love of the truth, in which everything that is superimposed and overtly effective is fundamentally removed. At the same time however, the performances embrace the ethical conscience of the artist with his deep, almost seismographic musical sensibility and a high expressivity.

There may indeed be something of a paradox here, because the innovators of the past are often only truly recognized and appreciated by later generations. The more energetically and decisively a pioneer has broken with the past, the more he or she will have been mistrusted and cast aside in their lifetimes, and the more is required from the rear-view mirror of posterity before they can start to be treated with respect, let alone with honor. In the case of Bix Beiderbecke, however, we have a happy exception to this general rule. His particular combination of an immensely likeable character with a jaw-dropping talent was enough to ensure that doors would open for him. In his short lifetime, both musical colleagues and audiences responded to him with a combination of affection, astonishment and awe. This was in spite of the fact that, in his own serene and unusually gentle way, he was effecting a significant game-change in jazz. There wasn’t any sudden break, neither were there factions fighting either for or against him, and yet he was responsible for an astonishing advance in the music. It progressed, it palpably gained in substance through him. Bix Beiderbecke is far from being out on his own. There were other great talents which burned brightly in the jazz age, only to burn themselves out, but his life story and his nemesis were so tragic, they still have the power to affect one deeply. However, in his case, what remains alongside the confused heap of anecdotes and hearsay are his recordings, all of them made within a span of just five remarkable years. Here we enter the real world of Bix Beiderbecke, a universe created by a mind of a superior order. Bix’s world is filled with clarity and bathed in light."

Popma van Oevering’s Opera Prima, with a certain Italian and north German flavour while at the same time bearing witness to an individual style, was to become widely disseminated in Europe, as appears from the mark it left on composers including Bach, Handel and even Mozart.

This recording emerges from Amjad Ali Khan's deep and long abiding commitment to peace and tolerance both in the larger world as well as in the smaller communities of city, neighborhood, and the circles of family and friends - a commitment which has taken him to the United Nations and the Nobel Peace Prize Ceremony in Oslo as well as the greatest concert halls and performing venues around the world.

Many of them wrote dances, too: minuets, sarabandes, gavottes and particularly waltzes. The tradition of great composers writing and arranging dances starts with Bach and Rameau, encompasses Mozart, Schubert, Brahms and Tchaikovsky and ends with Maurice Ravel, Sergei Prokofiev and Dmitri Shostakovich, whose Waltz No. 2 is regularly played on German classical radio stations. The only problem was that these dances were too easy for the virtuoso pianists, which is why some of these artists turned unassuming minuets waltzes and polkas into glittering virtuosic pieces which could be played only by professional pianists. One of the greatest pianists of all time was also a great arranger of music, Leopold Godowsky. This American virtuoso of Polish extraction arranged hundreds of pieces by other composers, especially works by Chopin and the waltz king Johann Strauss, and turned them into sparkling studies and encores, that test the technique and stamina of even the most accomplished player. The Viennese pianist and Beethoven pupil Carl Czerny, for generations the specter of all piano students and today remembered for his etudes, is also the composer of a charming arrangement of Franz Schubert’s bittersweet mourning waltz. Catherine Gordeladze, a native of Tiflis, Georgia, today lives and works out of Frankfurt, Germany. Ms. Gordeladze studied the piano in her native Georgia, Frankfurt and Weimar and is the winner of prestigious prizes and competitions. She has been playing with renowned orchestras in major concert venues all over the world. The artist gives piano recitals in many countries and is also much sought after as a chamber music partner.

The songs originate from the numerous islands scattered in the Caribbean between Cuba and Trinidad, as well as from some areas of the South American continent on the Atlantic coast. These islands and coastal regions are extremely diverse, culturally speaking, but they share a fundamental background: the mixing over time and space of a multitude of cultural heritages, mainly of African and European import, as well as of local making. Out of this mixing emerged a Caribbean identity with, however, pronounced regional distinctions very much reflected in the music. Like its Caribbean identity, dance is another unifying aspect of the music featured in this album. This is really popular party music with fast, rhythmic tempos and catchy tunes, meant for moving or dancing to, rather than for static enjoyment. Chilean-born multi-instrumentalist Pablo Carcamo is a notable master of the charango, an Amerindian version of the imported European mandolin, found amongst the population of the Andean region.

Among Telemann's hundreds of sonatas, his last publication of solos for melody instrument and basso continuo, the XII Solos a violin ou traversiere, contains music of great expressive depth. These twelve works not only sum up the composer's approach to the solo sonata over several decades, but also reveal his continuing exploration of the genre's possibilities. Yet they have been unfairly overshadowed by several of his earlier sonata collections. This recording by Lorenzo Cavasanti and the members of Tripla Concordia offers a new perspective on the XII Solos by performing four of them with recorder in place of violin or flute. Such flexibility of instrumentation was characteristic of Telemann, who often sanctioned alternative scorings in his publications. Paired with these works is a sonata preserved in a Brussels manuscript and one from the well-known Essercizii musici. The music's significance is explored in booklet notes by Telemann scholar Steven Zohn, author of Music for a Mixed Taste: Style, Genre, and Meaning in Telemann's instrumental works."

Their debut album is devoted to Italian and Spanish music for guitar and theorbo from the first half of the seventeenth century. A little-known repertory, characterized by rhythmic oddities and harmonic extravagances that challenge those of contemporary jazz. Ordinary ''alfabeto'' was the system used by guitarists of the period to mark chords: each letter corresponded to a single chord. But, in the ''false alphabet'', those letters which were marked with a slash indicated chords containing dissonances, often very bold. The trio, comprising guitar/theorbo, percussion instruments and colachon, reconstructs an ensemble typical of the seventeenth century. Breathtaking rhythms, ''dirty'' chords, improvisations and variations: these are the colors they seek to convey in their sound. The beauty and the challenge of this disc lie precisely in providing an interpretation that respects everything notated in the score, and in the choice of arrangements and timbres. This music sounds modern and perhaps slightly provocative to us, but all of it was written around 1640."

The ensemble has specialized in the performance of Baroque chamber music and, as the name ''Matis'' implies, pay sspecial attention to small details, nuances, and timbres in the music and in ensemble playing. The ensemble's goal is to bring the music with its wealth of color closer to the audience and to bring to life different expressive values. The image of a dream, of a soap bubble, of the short blossoming of a rose - probably at no time was the visualization of transience so colorfully an doriginally, so profoundly and full of allusions, so diversely and also so sensually depicted in painting as in the seventeenth century. It was a time of upheaval in which violence, war, epidemics, and hardship collided with great economic prosperity and highly sophisticated courtly art, in which teh fervor of the most diverse religious beliefs was radically lived out, and in which there prevailed, alongside the omnipresence of death, an incredible desire for a life full of joy, as short as it might be. The Dutch painter Evert Collier created works of great virtuosity - his still lifes, number among the particularly opulent of their genre.

Following the album of cello concertos by Haydn and CPE Bach, audite now presents the second disc with the French cellist. Departing from home: in Schelomo, Bloch examines his cultural and religious roots; in his cello concerto, Dvorák illustrates both his old and his new native countries, whilst the forest scene Klid represents a bridge and also an atmospheric reminiscence. In all three works, the composers look from Europe to America and vice versa: Bloch's Schelomo was written immediately before his crossing to America; Dvorák composed his B minor Cello Concerto only once he had arrived there. Klid (Silent Woods) sits in between: before departing for America, Dvorák arranged this work, originally for piano duet, for cello and piano, to be played during his farewell tour. In this format, the piece became so popular that he went on to produce an additional version for cello and orchestra. Antonín Dvorák and Ernest Bloch provide clear performing instructions, but also demand a high degree of free interpretation. Marc Coppey manages to realise both of these aspects, maintaining a convincing balance and communicating intensively with the orchestra. He does not need to demonstrate his virtuosity through overly hasty tempi: instead, he follows the recommendations found in the scores. This greatly benefits the clarity, vividness and eloquence of his interpretations. The Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin and Kirill Karabits prove congenial partners."

He had never attended primary school; instead, his mother had taught him reading, writing and arithmetic as best she could. At the piano, meanwhile, he had revealed his talent as a child prodigy, and his fat was sealed. The conservatory professors soon found, however, that this pupil was different, strong-willed, impetuous, and rebellious. His somewhat conservative piano teacher Antoine Francois Marmontel, for one, could make no headway whatsoever with the young savage. After initial successes, disenchantment followed in 1880. Debussy was only awarded a ''diploma'' in piano accompaniment: this was the conservatory jury's way of granting the would-be virtuoso a mere consolation prize. The child prodigy had failed. It is all the more curious to learn, therefore, that Marmontel was teh one who directed Debussy's attention to a lucrative opportunity: Nadezhda von Meck, the eccentric widow of a rich Baltic German railroad owner, was a patron of the arts with a particular penchant fo rmusic, and she was looking for a pianist to accompany her on her annual summer trips through Europe. The resulting piano trio si so spirited and full of vigor that the shadows in which it emerged are simply not noticable: instead, it testifies to Ravel's overflowing creative drive. Here, his style is fine-honed to the extreme, pointed and succinct, almost Constructivist. Innovative rhythms and metric structures are the Trio's most striking feature."

Or was he more of a British artist- since in London, during and after the war, he also worked as a highly respected choir director and composition professor with an international network of contacts? Matyas Seiber was all of those. His music, especially his chamber music, displays that same great variety, sometimes in crazy, witty mixtures. This album features several works where Seiber shone the musical spotlight on the clarinet or on the human voice. Perhaps half a century had to pass for a new generation of open-minded musicians to unearth and rediscover all the humor, felling and energy that this music still holds in store for us, with its fearless self-assurance and its healthy disregard for limitations of genre or national borders.

He was an outstanding German composer who lived and worked in the late Baroque - the same age as the masters Bach and Handel. Although nowadays his famous contemporaries often overshadow him, in his lifetime he was known as one of the most productive and versatile musicians. After centuries of neglect, his character and creativity seem to be winning tha trespect once again. One of the influences of Telemann's inexhaustible melodic invention was his close contact with Polish music. He worked in Silesia - in Sorau and Pless at the court of Count Erdmann II - courtier, friend, Privy Councillior, and finally the Cabinet Minister for the King of Poland and Elector of Saxony August II. With Erdmann, Telemann had travelled through the Republic, stopping at roadside taverns and inns where he listened in admiration and amazement to the Polish players who entertained the people with popular melodies. In his diary he mentioned these visits, ''It is hard to believe how wonderful the ideas of those pipers and fiddlers are when, during a break in the dancing, they begin to improvise. Listening to them with attention, in eight days a man could collect enough musical ideas for his whole life!'' Telemann was a practical man and appreciated the treasures he found in that store of Polish music. As he said, he had collected many ideas and much inspiration, which the number of his compositions can be an evidence of, in which there are rhythms and phrases typical to Polish dances. In another place he writes, ''I am grateful for my acquaintance with the players of Polish music, and I must say that I found a lot of good and diverse ideas in it. The material has served me well in a number of court compositions.'' For years to come Telemann was to use the melodies he had heard in Polish palaces and taverns and he constantly referred to the Polish musical style in the highest terms. In Polish music Telemann saw an autonomous style, in addition to the three widely recognized and imitated musical schools of French, German, and Italian origins known in Europe at that time. He puts the Polish style next to these three schools and made it equally important. Thus, his observations and descriptions are very valuable indications for us today in reconstructing the musical character of his time. The name of the project and the ensemble refers to this tragic time. For the Polish people, the beginning of the 18th century was a time of lush diversity of musical culture. On the other hand - and perhaps above all - it was the ''time of the plague.'' Life is a joyous procession of dance but let us not lose sigh tof the quirks of fate and our inevitable end."

As the Second World War was coming to an end in 1944-45, the eighty-year-old composer was working on his Oboe Concerto and Sonatina No. 2 for winds, as well as the Metamorphosen for strings. While the lattter work was an explicit response to the destruction Strauss was witnessing, in the Concerto and the Sonatina the composer seemed to be turning his mind away from the events surrounding him. There is a pastoral quality to the oboe concerto, with a highly tuneful solo part and more than occasional touches of nostalgia for the 18th century. Similarly, Strauss headed the score of teh sonatina with a dedication ''to the spirit of the immortal Mozart at the end of a life full o fthankfulness''. To an extent, one might say that Strauss at the end of his life returned to the muscal models of his youth. It is therefore fitting that these two works frame the Serenade in E flat major fo rwind ensemble, composed more than sixty years earlier in the tradition of entertainment music by Schubert and Mendelssohn.

On this second instalment, the last three quartets of the set are performed by the Chiaroscuro Quartet, a highly international ensemble formed in 2005 by the violinists Alina Ibragimova and Pablo Hernan Benedi, the Swedish violist Emilie HOrnlund and cellist Claire Thirion from France. Dubbed ''a trailblazer for the authentic performance of High Classical chamber music'' in Gramophone."

That there nevertheless are a number of chamber works by him featuring the violin is to a large extent due to teh violinist Samuel Dushkin. The two were introduced to each other by Stravinsky's german music publisher who wanted to persudade him to compose a violin concerto. They obviously hit it off: their collaboration continued after the concerto had come into being in 1931, and they devised a recital programme to perform together on tours. The centrepiece was Duo concertant which Stravinsky completed in 1932 as his only original composition for violin and piano. Rather than looking for common ground between the two instruments, Stravinsky aimed to emphasize their individuality in a work that he himself claimed was ''determiend by my love of the pastoral poets of antiquity and their scholarly art and technique''. The other pieces on this album are, with one exception, arrangements of Stravinsky's own works including The Firebird, Petrushka and Le rossignol. The majority were made for and in collaboration with Dushkin, but a few come from the 1920's and were intended for teh violinist aPaul Kochanski. One of these is the Suite for Violin and Piano, arranged from the ballet Pulcinella - material that Stravinsky revisited in the 1930's in order to make a new version for dushkin. With this programme, and in the company of the eminent Russian pianist Peter Laul, the highly virtuosic and temperamental violinist Ilya Gringolts makes his return to BIS."

The present album brings together some of Pickard's most recent orchestral compositions, in performances by two o fhis long-time collaborators: the BBC National Orchestra of Wales and conductor Martyn Brabbins. The opening work is Symphony no. 5, which was composed in 2014 with these performers in mind. Lasting some thirty minutes, the symphony is in a single continuous movement. It requires no less than three timpanists who are placed at the back of the orchestra to the right, left and centre, leading to some dramatic antiphonal exchanges. The symphony is followed by Sixteen Sunrises, the result of the composer's wish to compose a piece ''filled with light''. The title of the piece refers to the number of sunrises that can be observed during a twenty-four-hour period from the International Space Station, as it orbits the earth. Musical depictions of sunrises are normally gradual processes, but viewed from teh ISS, a sunrise occurs in a matter of seconds, and it is the idea of suddenly shifting from darkness to light that formed the basis of the shape of Pickard's piece."

""Upright Piano"" is an organic recording from Bar Moskus in Trondheim, with the audience present. The recording shows Bekken's breadth as a performer and composer, and clearly refers to both his inspirational encounter with New Orleans, and a sidelight to traditional Norwegian tones from Finnskogen. Pianist, singer and ukulele player Dr. Bekken is a musician who is interested in the whole history of jazz. A lifelong dedication to the art of traditional blues driven piano has given him a mastery of that idiom which few players can grasp, much less deliver. Bekken works within the field of modern, free improvisation, citing pianists like Don Pullen, Bobby Few and Charles Gayle as the central sources of inspiration. Bekken has played jazz and blues piano since childhood, and has absorbed all the nuances in the process."

He worked with Rossini, achieved success quickly with his own operas and was the subject of much gossip over an affair with Paolina Bonaparte which went on mainly between Viareggio and Lucca, where Pacini settled. Having nailed his colors to the Borbone mast in Lucca, Pacini fell from grace for a time but came back to even greater professional success with his appointment as director of the San Carlo opera house in Naples. Renowned in his day, Pacini was however soon out-shone by Bellini and Donizetti and although he continued to write operas, he devoted more and more time to teaching. Pacini's output was not wholly original, often mannered and hurriedly put together yet it includes several gems such as Saffo, Medea a Corinto and this Il Convitato di pietra, a farce in two acts which its composer always called an ''operetta''. Pacini explicitly took Mozart's masterpiece Don Giovanni as his model and created a parody of it. There is no Donna Elvira, however, and several scenes traditionally featuring her now centre - at the cost of some suffering to the plot - on the character of Zerlina. In line with standard practice, the servant takes a new name - in this case Ficcanaso, i.e. Nosey - and the opera shifts its centre of interest from the relationship between Man and God to teh world of women and relations between father and son, since the characters are supposed to be members of the composer's family. The opera is written well, properly constructed on the lbiretto by Gaetano Barbieri and is not without difficulties for the performers, even when they were members of the composer's own family. The score calls for a chamber orchestra, comprising four first and four second violins, two violas, a cello, a double-bass and two flutes, and a small male choir with the part for the tenors often divided into two lines. The opera is particularly suited to performance in small venues but requires highly capable singers. The libretto is light-footed and clearly inspired by the many Don Giovanni that had gone before, from Mozart-Da Ponte down. The recitatives are spoken but speech is also used for events of major importance, for instance the attempted rape. The storyline is simplified and Zerlina carries great weight and replaces Donna Elvira in several scenes. Her great importance in the plot turns this character from a naive country girl into a cunning, calculating woman along the lines of Goldoni's Elisa. Shortly before the finale she also has an aria for a prima donna of great worth. It makes an ideal concert aria for a coloratura soprano: overall, teh role demands a light, soubrette-style voice with a great range and considerable agility. The aria for Donna Anna, ''Care sponde'' and the tuneful aria for the tenor are both instances of Pacini's compositional abilities at their best. Indeed, overall the music is competent and confident, light-footed and holds the listener's interest."

Curious about everything, he doesn't omit going to Venice and seeing for himself how the ''nation is crazy'' about music: There are hardly no evenings without an academy somewhere; people rush...to listen with as much enthusiasm as if it were the first time. Here, there is a kind of music that does nto exist in France...Long concertos without solo violin. Vivaldi became a very close friend, to sell me really expensive concertos. He sort of succeeded, but I also got what I wanted: to listen to him and live such special musical moments.

One composer, whose oeuvre finds an exceptional variety of equally impressive and moving psalm settings, is placed here front and center: Heinrich Schutz. The ''father of German music'' created a ''psalms project'' of a breadth and depth unlike any other composer through the musical arrangement of the Becker Psalter and of many other works.

Since their Wigmore Hall debut in 2006, the Lendvai String Trio has had a busy schedule of concerts at major venues throughout Europe, including several re-invitations to Wigmore Hall, recitals at King's Place, the Barbican and Purcell Room in London, the Concertgebouw in Amsterdam and Musikaliska in Stockholm. ''...there's an order of mastery casually involved here that's quite out of the ordinary.'' (International Record Review). ''The Lendvai Trio's enthusiasm for these works compels attention, and one can hear the broad grins on their faces as they planned...'' (Gramophone)."

For its very first album on Chandos, the National Youth Orchestra of Grea tBritain devotes its characteristic energy and musical mastery to an explosive programme that transcends daily life and eathly experience. It is helped by the enthusiastic, encouraging, and experienced baton of Edward Gardner as well as by teh sumptuous yet detailed acoustic of Symphony Hall, Birmingham, all fully revealed in this recording. Their performance of Strauss's Also sprach Zarathustra and Holst's The planets is already a point of reference in the UK after the immensely successful Prom concert that preceded the recording. The concert's five-star review in The Daily Telegraph praised in particular the orchestra's ''great attack and complete absence of anything routine'', while The Guardian emphasized the great performance of the orchestra in this ''graceful and evocative programme'', especially the ''depth and richness of sound that belied their youth''."

Their journey through works that encapsulate the variety of nuance and color of which the instrument is capable, inevitably led them to another great composer for the medium: Max Reger. The Brahs-influenced, essentially lyrical and tender works recorded here contrast particularly with the more familiar, contrapuntally rich - and loud - organ music usually associated with Reger. The three clarinet sonatas are among fourteen such duo works in his published output, composed between 1890 and 1915: effectively his entire compositional career. Although his continuing adherence to sonata-form principles is clearly evident in the two Op. 49 sonatas, teh greater formal clarity of Op. 107 suggests that the lightness and geniality, even plainness, which Reger ascribed to it form part of an underlying ''classical'' simplicity of conception, for all the music's ''modernistic'' surface. On top of his conducting career (City of London Sinfonia, Philharmonia Orchestra) and various recitals around the world, Michael Collins will hold a four-concert residency at LSO St. Luke's in the 2017-18 season, dedicated to chamber music and including recitals with Michael McHale."

He helped to organize cultural life in Theresienstadt concentration camp. Bundibar, a children's opera based on a play by Aristophanes, was the last work Krasa completed before he was arrested by teh Nazis in 1942. Krasa was sent to the Theresienstadt ghetto where he reworked Brundibar for the available forces, which was the nperformed 55 times in the camp and also features in teh infamous propaganda film made for the Red Cross in 1944. In the chequered history of Brundibar it lay forgotten for several decades. A reappraisal was said to have started first at the end of the 1970's. While investigating her family history, the Benedictine nun and music teacher Maria Veronika Gruters, rather accidentally, came across the material of the opera. Showing great commitment she staged Brundibar with her student ensemble in German. The Benedictine nun orchestrated the children's opera for her student orchestra for the piano score, which was in the Czech of Hebew language, and wrote a German libretto. The German premiere finally took place in July, 1985 at the St. Ursula Secondary School in Freiburg."

They bear witness to the period of transition from classicism to romanticism, particularly in terms of orchestral color. That both should be so neglected is partly down to historical accident: they were composed just four years after Beethoven's monumental ''Eroica'' Symphony. So when Weber's symphonies saw the light of day, overshadowed by the great master, no one took much notice. There are certainly more mature symphonies than Weber's two youthful essays, but few are as much fun; the second might have been composed by a Haydn in the making.

The city provided a stage for the flamboyant host, Prince-Archbishop Maximilian Gandolph, Count of Kuenburg - power and self-presentation have always gone hand in hand. Due to their sensitive instrumentation, the suites of teh Andreas Christoph Clamer's table music Mensa Harmonica were most probably performed at these festivities within a small-scale gathering. Alongside performances in the private chamber of teh Prince Archbishop, it is conceivable that the works were also played at open-air concerts, perhaps in the pleasure garden at Castle Hellbrunn with its famous fountains. It was customary to liste to ''sweet music'' while occupied in ''most pleasant entertainment'' such as dice and card games. Little is known about the composer Andreas Chrstoph Clamer. The son of the cathedral organist and Hofkapellmeister Gaudenz Clamer at Salzburg was born in 1633 and most probably enjoyed a musical education at the cathedral music school. In 1682, Clamer is described on the cover of his Mensa Harmonica as master of ceremonies of the Salzburg cathedral chapter. Alongside this function, he was appointed as ''Instructor'' of the choristers and ultimately as ''Regens Chori'' of the royal choral music in the cathedral."

The harpsichord, which had definitely fallen out of favor because of its limited musical expression, was now superseded by the pianoforte. The range of the new instrument was expanded and in order to enhance its expressive possibilities, pedals were added to modify its tone color and timbre. Another instrument also underwent a rapid evolution: the transverse flute. The famous flute-maker Johann Georg Tromlitz developed a new key system that allowed flute players to perform with greater velocity, produce a pleasant, even tone and optimize intonation across the full range of the instrument. As to the cello, innovation affected not so much its construction as its role: the instrument gradually freed itself from playing a supporting role to the piano and became an equal partner in the ensemble, engaging in dialogue with the other instruments in its own right. And so this combination of instruments – flute, cello and piano – was now ready to establish itself in the chamber music genre. This release explores those first chamber works, and includes pieces by Carl-Maria von Weber, Friedrich Kuhlau, and Carl Czerny."

The first five volumes were released in 2015 as a reminiscence of the famous Georgian conductor Djansug Kakhidze on the occasion of his 80th birthday. He belonged to the small but highly prestigious group of Eastern European conductors who set up a cultural counterdraft to the political conflicts in the times of the cold war. He conducted almost every A class symphony orchestra in his hemisphere and became a much-vaunted advocate of late romantic orchestral repertoire. Mvravinsky adored him for his Tchaikovsky interpretations and the Neue Zurcher Zeitung called him respectfully “the Georgian Karahjan.” And indeed, although most comparisons go lame there were some similarities: the economical gestures, the endless working on sound perfection, the passion for big dynamics and a great affection for the Golden Age of classic and romantic music. But unlike Karajan he did not only put most of his emphasis on the sheer beauty of the orchestral sound, but also investigated the disaccords in the music and did not hesitate to unfold it. Together with the Tbilisi Symphony Orchestra, which he founded in 1993 he shaped the character of the music and, if necessary, explored its limits. Volume six is dedicated to his favorite composer Tchaikovsky, whom he accredited as already with the late symphonies with inimitable orchestral verve. In addition there is a reunion with another legendary Georgian musician, pianist Nodar Gabuni, who joins the maestro in a breathtaking reading of Tchaikovsky’s Piano Concerto No. 1."

One could write endlessly about his career which began almost by chance after he graduated in law, or about his relationship with his teacher, the great baritone Riccardo Stracciari, or about his clashes with directors (for example in the 1948 version of Boris Godunov directed by Peter Broook) or colleagues (the 1956 Medea in Riome with Maria Callas). One could give a detailed description of his concept of art, of opera, of music and of life itself. But, alas space is short. Let us concentrate then, on this production of Khovatchina, recorded live at the Foro Italico on August 3rd 1958 in Rome during the then magnificent RAI seasons. It should be noted at once that this recording fills a most serious gap and brings us one of the key roles Christoff was to perform during his career. It is incomprehensible why he was made to record the complete edition of Mussorgsky's melodies - a monument to Christoff's art - two versions of Boris Godunov (in 1952 with Issay Dobrowen and ten years later with André Cluytens) but never his colorful interpretation of Dossifej. Khovanshchina was written between 1872 and 1880 in St. Petersburg, Russia. When the composer died in 1881, the opera remained unfinished and unperformed. The work deals with Russian history, particularly the rebellion of Prince Ivan Khovansky, the Old Believers, and the Muscovite Streltsy against the regent Sofia Alekseyevna and the young Tsars Peter the Great and Ivan V."

His art grows from the ground of native tradition, that of the Anglican cathedral and collegiate choir and its revival in the decades since the First World War; it owes a debt to those who ''collected'' English folksong, while it was still there to collect; and it connects with the richness of English lyrical poetry. A disciple of Vaughan Williams, Finzi or Howells? His music also harbors traces of Messiaen, Durufle and Vierne. The Epiphoni Consort and their director Tim Reader are passionate advocates of Bednall's music, and this enterprising debut recording - opening with the ravishing depiction of luminosity that is his 40-part motet Lux orta est lusto - serves to highlight why Bednall is well on his way to becoming one of the UK's best-loved living choral composers. The Epiphoni Consort was established in 2014 to bring together singers who have advanced vocal and choral training but other primary careers. It has since developed a reputation for creative programming with a commitment to the music of living composers. In 2015, the choir was winner of Tenebrae's Locus Iste Competition, following which they joined Tenebrae on stage at St. James', Spanish Place. The Consort performed at Sir Terry Pratchett's memorial at the Barbican and made its first TV appearance in 2016 in a BBC4 documentary, The Joy of Rachmaninov."

Yet even in his new heyday for the instrument, Sean Shibe - whose full album debut here nests among four of those Bream-commissioned works a clutch of Dowland pieces from a previous Elizabethan Golden Age - stands out as a truly uncommon talent. ''I want to hear his interpretation of Britten's Nocturnal over and over,'' wrote David Nice in an awed recent concert review. ''This, for me, is the definitive performance.'' Born in Edinburgh, in 2012 Shibe became the first guitarist to be selected for the BBC Radio 3 New Generation Artists scheme, and the only solo guitarist to be awarded a Borletti-Buitoni Trust Fellowship.

For a neo-Corellian, he is unusually fond of complexity, both technical and compositional, and also unusually open to other contemporary influences, such as those of Handel and Vivaldi. But th equality of his music speaks for itself - virtuosic and joyously melodic, these six ''chamber sonatas'' had a huge impact on Delphian producer Paul Baxter. Carbonelli's difficulty has ensured that his work is seldom played, but early-music rising star Bojan Cicic makes sure we have no sense of that as he and his Illyria Consort colleagues champion these groundbreaking compositions with exuberant confidence. Bojan Cicic is leader of Floreligium and frequently guest directs the Academy of Ancient Music and European Union Baroque Orchestra.

No piano or guitar. Nobody misses them, not for a second! Astounding with this somewhat idiosyncratic formulation, Hornstrom has surprised and thrilled every listener with this fresh, unconventional four man orchestra for the past 11 years. With the richness of their sound of their current album ''Dark'', the ideal of the band, the members of which used to like wearing bath caps and called themselves ''proficient swimmers'', is inevitably ascending to provisional heights. Because Klaus Heidenreich, Tobias Wember, Silvio Morger, and Markus Braun have actually succeeded with ''Dark'' in creating something like a comprehensive quadrature of a circle: combining the highest degree of compositional diligence with the unconditional desire for improvisational freedom as well as the greatest possible virtuosity in the handling of the isntruments with a casual portion of humor, which can sometimes also take refreshing self-mocking twists. All factors that Hornstrom purposefully but never audibly cramped acquired during its quite long existence in addition to a number of awards. The eight songs - all self-compositions by the trombonists Wember and Heidenreich - meander somewhere on the edges of modern jazz, rock, minimal music, and drum'n'bass without wanting to join the general trend of cross-bordering. It just happens, more consistently than ever. To mold clear musical structures with sober and at the same time elegiac elements into a homogeneous band sound is the declared goal, Tobias Wember stated. It need not be a contradiction by any means if the guys of Hornstrom place the development of the four individuals in the foreground precisely in this mature collective."

The name of the ensemble refers to the famous String Quartet No. 2 “Messages” by Andrzej Panufnik. The Messages Quartet was created in the year of the 100th anniversary of Panufnik’s birthday- 2014. The musicians of the Quartet are graduates of the Fryderyk Chopin University of Music in Warsaw and the Academy of Music in Krakow. They also graduated from the solo studies and from masterclasses at European universities. Apart from the concert activity, they also dedicate themselves to teaching at the Academy of Music in Katowice and Krakow."

Today he is known mainly for Matrimonio Segreto, but his output of operas numbers almost one hundred works, which were performed to resounding success anywhere there was a theatre and a company of singers. In his long and successful creative life, Cimarosa also wrote a series of sonatas for keyboard, generally very short but full of interest and worthy heirs to Domenico Scarlatti's 555 harpsichord sonatas. A first collection of the Cimarosa Sonatas was published by Felice Boghen in Paris in 1925. Bohen's collection consisted of 32 sonatas, and almost all performers used that publication. In 1971, two Italian pianists, Vincenzo Vitale and Carlo Bruno, made a new edition based on the Cimarosa manuscripts of the Conservatory of Florence, adding 31 new sonatas. Andrea Coen recently published the complete 88 Sonatas in two books. After a first album featuring 44 of the works, pianist Dario Canela now concludes the project with this second release.

Her father writes of discovering her talent: “I remember her very first performance which was for her primary class in public school, and that would have to be 14 years ago. That was a revelation, actually. She had this ability to perform in public, and give a performance that made musical sense and imparted a very strong message to the audience."

He adds a ''world music'' touch to this soundtrack, borrowing not only from the sounds of the Middle East and Andalusia, but also from jazz and Latin music, while the presence of a string orchestra provides a density and groove that echo the great film scores of the 60's and 70's, especially the music of Claude Bolling, Vladimir Cosma and Lalo S."

This album represents a wonderful initiation for anyone wanting to hear the artistic palette of this major pianist - a reference for others. Francis, whose lyricism and melodic phrasing are constantly on the edge, has no equal when it comes to making melodies from jazz, pop and classical music entirely his own. With an art as precious as this, he deserves to be in the limelight more often. Three things make Didier Lockwood an unavoidable figure in music; first, he's an eclectic musician, an impassioned visionary recognized by all; second, he's also a producer, stimulating and revealing new talents; and third, as a teacher he shows heart and conviction.

As an art form, however, the vo-cool style did not reach a point of fruitful maturity until the mid-fifties, roughly the itme when cool instrumental jazz relinquished its critical and popular following to hard bop. In 1954, trumpeter Chet Baker recorded his first collection of vocals, and the following year Capitol released June Christy’s first and finest album, “Something Cool.” The following January, Mel Torme began his remarkable series of albums with arranger Marty Paich- which led to the masterpiece of this era, 1960s “Mel Torme Swings Shubert Alley.” Will Friedwald is one of the rare people to have noticed the phenomenon. It was quite incidental, and also short lived- it lasted less than a decade- although its consequences were considerable. Friedwald gave a fair definition of it when he wrote, “Cool singers choose to imply rather than directly state. They prefer to understate, treating a song like an impressionist painter treats a subject, suggesting its outline with a brush stroke here, a patch of color there, letting the listener put it all together in his own head. Listeners can never be passive spectators here; they have to work at understanding these sounds.”"

The songs of Jacques Prevert, whether they are set to music of his poems, or written for the cinema, have been engraved here by many contemporary artists. Some of them have become international standards such as Les feilles mortes composed by Joseph Kosma. In this release, Olivier Julien highlights the musical journey of the poet's works an dhis timeless interpreters: from Lys Gauty to Piaf, Montand and Marlene Dietrich. There is no doubt that Prevert remains one of the greatest French poets of the 20th century. A carefree Parisian figure, he had an innate feeling for words, rhymes and sounds that appeared in his poems, but also in plays, films and music. The songs of Prevert have been recorded by a great many contemporary artists - not only his own poems set to music, but also titles he wrote for films, and some, like ''Autumn Leaves'', are today great international standards. On this recording, Olivier Julien focuses on the musical career of his poetic works through the timeless voices of performers."

So the country's hopes were resting on Szymon Nehring, and although few would have tipped him as a winner he enjoyed understandable support in the hall and countrywide, winning the Audience Prize in the final analysis. The Krakow-born pianist, who had just turned 20 when the competition opened, certianly aroused interest with his playing. Reviewing his Second Stage appearance in the Chopin Courier, Kacper Miklaszewski said, ''The search for subtlety took away a bit of clarity from the interpretations of Szymon Nehring, who nevertheless built a convincing dramaturgy in the Polonaise in F sharp minor.'' Getting across all the hurdles in this most demanding of competitions, Nehring certainly proved his worth by the time he stepped out to play the Piano Concerto in E minor in a performance that mixed muscularity and gracefulness. Showing qualities that in retrospect can also be found here in performances recorded earlier in the competition, he found the sweep of the concerto's first movement and the dreaminess of the second, before dispatching the rhythms of the ifnale with a natural, native flexibility. It was a well-rounded performance that justified his place as a laureate."

Her interests have always been related to combining Medieval and contemporary aesthetics, which can also be appreciated in this Istampite recording, where she teams up with two percussionists, Jim Denley and Pedro Estevan, to support her deeply informed fiddle and hurdy-gurdy renderings of 14th-century Florentine repertoire. The challenge of creating music for a wide range of contexts is important to Wishart, such as composing for productions by Michele Noiret and Wayne McGregor, a large-scale choral work for a Proms commission with the BBC Singers and Sinfonye, and for the designer Philippe Starck. With the support of a Visiting Music Fellowship at the University of Cambridge she is currently composing a double-bass concerto for the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenemtn, London and The Handel and Haydn Society Boston.

The last words he wrote in his treatise On the Feminine in Human Nature, on February 13, 1881, were ''love - tragedy''. Although it is usually far too simplistic to interpret works of art purely in the context of biological information, several of Wagner's compositions really do have a dairy-like nature, with the character of personal revelations. One such work is the Siegfried Idyll, a symphonic overture from 1870 that Wagner wrote for his wife Cosima to remember the birth of their eldest son. Another is the song cycle Wesendonck Lieder, which Wagner wrote in stages over 1857 and 1858.

Among his earliest friends in newly arrived Vienna, Beethoven had both personal and professional relationships with guitarists including Raimund von Wetzler, Austrian government official and musicologist Raphael Georg Kiesewetter, Countess Maria Wilhelmine von Thun. Besides these affable friendships, Beethoven also pursued love interests with women who had connections to the guitar, including Antonie Brentano, Therese Malfatti, Countess Maria Carolina Anna von Thun, and Regina Hitzelberger-Lang. Despite, or maybe because of Beethoven's acquaintance with casual guitarists, he did not compose for the guitar: perhaps his encroaching hearing loss did not enable him to value guitar performances, perhaps teh instrument was not sonorous enough for his interests, or perhaps he did not cultivate the direct personal associations with professional players necessary to master an unfamiliar medium. His four compositions for mandolin and harpsichord of 1796 are a natural resutl of his experience with string writing prompted by personal patronage. Alongside informal awareness of the guitar, professional virtuoso performers also moved within Beethoven's circle in immediate and indirect contact."

Upon transmitting a score to his friend Telemann, Pisendel expressed the wish that the former would ''taste many, many of the sweet fruits of this almond tree'', thus creating a parallel between Zelenka's music and the symbolism of ''shell'' and ''kernel''; ''secret'' and ''knowledge''. We know so little of Zelenka's life that there is little one can add to the first text. Zelenka did not seem to want to be remembered other than by is music. The particularity of hemeticism is to keep a secret, not to reveal it. It is probably that in using this analogy, Pisendel was hinting at alchemy. Many composers of the time practised the secrets of their art in the hermetic mode. It should be remembered that the only work printed in Zelenka's lifetime was, in fact, an enigmatic canon. It is clear that historically, for a long time, reception of Zelenka's work highlighted the idea of strangeness. How would he have responded to this? C.P.E. Bach for example, categorically refuted this label that had often been attached to him too. What is certain is that Zelenka was a demanding composer. At a time when the search for simplicity had arrived from Italy and taken hold in the Dresden community in which he lived, he made constant use of counterpoint."

On the nine miniatures, the two accomplices support each other and trade licks in a relaxed atmosphere. Loos was already playing with his distinctive, slightly precious, tone. With subtlety, he hemmed the waves of pure, precise sax improvisations, in turns alto, soprano and tenor. Their music fully fit into the new chamber jazz style that had appeared in the previous decade via ECM and to which many European jazzmen aspired. Emblematic of this approach, ''Valse de Nuit'' creates a dreamy, starlit sensation. Time stands still, with the subconscience constantly gliding from wellbeing burdened with funny or intriguing titles such as ''Ca C'est Mechant'', the music remains graceful, elegant, nostalgic, modest and aware of its deep classical roots, wrapped in a veil that is somewhere between solemn and dreamy, which is also that of the release as a whole. This was the first step of a tandem that would subsequently have a rich career, playing on several occasions as a duo or in other configurations, including trios with flautist Ali Ryerson and singer Maurane, and the Thais String Quartet."

The Native composers here include a wide range of approaches and styles; Connor Chee's fantasy on a Navajo theme, Raven Chacon's exploration of noise and feedback from the piano mechanism, Brent michael Davids' sultry jazz miniature, and ballet transcriptions by inspirational forebear Dr. Louis Ballard. The other composers pay homage to particular themes, such as John Luther Adams' stone figures, Michael Daugherty's bison dance, Peter Garland's peyote rituals, Kyle Gann's chant to save the earth and Martin Bresnick's homage to Ishi, the last of his tribe. The program is rounded out with complementary works by Jennifer Higdon, Carl Ruggles, Peter Gilbert, and Sufi convert Talib Rasul Hakim."

He lived at a time when an early death had led to such a status, from Goethe's ''Sorrows of Young Werther'' via Mozart, Schubert and Mendelssohn, to our own Henrik Wergeland. There is so much that remains unexpressed and unrealized in the figure of Rikard Nordraak, so much that has to do with what he could have accomplished. Would he have composed the lofty Norwegian opera of which Bjornson had dreamed? Might he have written the great Norwegian Romantic Symphony? Or, owing to his rather easy-going disposition, might he have slipped steadily into obscurity?"

In addition to the works on this album, Friedrich A. Reissinger and Ole Olsen composed for band and choir in Norway, and from abroad we know works for this combination by Anton Bruckner, Franz Liszt, Gustav Holst and Kurt Weill. The repertoire consists in the main of music written for solemn occasions usually held outdoors. The choice of pure wind instrumentation in addition to the choir probably was due to both acoustic and meteorological considerations related to an outdoor performance. Moreoever, we must not forget that military bands were Norway's only profesional full-time ensembles when these pieces were written and, then as now, were the obvious choice for making music on days of national celebration. There are no earlier recordings of most of the pieces on this album, and we are not sure whether or not some were ever performed again after being premiered. This makes it all the more satisfying to shed light on them now in the hope that they may once again find their way back into concert programmes."

Five large-scale compositions would be the result. The first two, which are the subject of this recording, had likely been committed to paper by the time Beethoven travelled to Vienna to study with haydn. Their formal aspects alone seem to link them to the suite form of the Baroque more closely than the last three, in which Beethoven cultivated the classical sonata form, albeit somewhat removed from the essentially entertaining ''serenade style'' refined by Mozart."

In an age of widespread nationalism, and with the threat of German power at their doorstep, French artists set out to establish a firm national identity of their own. It was under these circumstances that Caille Saint-Saens co-founded the Societe Nationale de Musique to promote the music of young French composers. As a member of that society, Faure became a centerpiece of the scene musicale, and ultimately an artistic model for Claude Debussy and his impressionistic colleagues. Robert Demaine is an American virtuoso cellist who has been hailed by The New York Times as ""an artist who makes one hang on every note"". He has distinguished himself as one o fthe finest and most versatile instrumentalists of his generation, performing to critical acclaim as soloist, recitalist, orchestral principal, recording artist and chamber musician.

By showing life in a cheerful, humorous and often shameless way, it attracted to the main theatres of Madrid, the Principe and the Cruz, a society wishing to be entertained with fresh and daring presentations of daily matters. An important component of the Tonadillas are seguidillas- songs based on popular dances- which were joined near the end of that century by the Tirana, another musical form that had arisen from Spanish folklore. Both seguidillas and tiranas constitute links between the different social spaces that define the tonal identity of Spanish music at the end of the Enlightenment. Beyond their popularity in the theatre, seguidillas and tiranas as a traditional form of entertainment were also performed in a more personal, private social space: the home. In their most danceable origin, seguidillas and tiranas were accompanied on the guitar, just as they are on this release."

Frederick Delius' four violin and piano sonatas were written between 1892 and 1930 and so chart comprehensively his creative development.

Lionel Handy arranged the Sonata for cello and piano in 2012 and on November 23 of that year he gave the first public performance of his transcription with Nigel Clayton as pianist at a concert held in The Warehouse, London to celebrate the 150th anniversary of Delius's birth. Arnold Bax is widely regarded as an orchestral composer. However, he also wrote a significant quantity of chamber music.

The brilliant virtuoso and magician of pianistic opulence with the minimalistic ascetic of sound? Steffen Schleiermacher has discovered astonishing parallels between the former's late oeuvre and the latter's early oeuvre, which was taking shape at just about the same time. Together with the Gewandhaus concertmaster Andreas Seidel he is now presenting his astonishing new findings to the listening public - surprises are guaranteed. Now and again reminiscences of past times are heard, for example, in the ''Romance oubilee,'' before this forgotten romance unravels into ethereal nothingness. Moreover, Richard Wagner makes his presence felt again and again. Liszt's very mixed feelings about his son-in-law, whose death in Venice he foresaw like a visionary, is reflected in the two ''Sad Gondolas'' - and after Wagner actually had died in the heartrending and overwhelming ''R.W. - Venezia.'' Erik Satie, the house composer of the Wagner devotee Sar Peladan and his Rosicrucians, did precisely the opposite of what was expected of him. Statis sounds and sequences of unresolved chords without development hold his music in a permanent state of suspended animation managing without a beginning or an end. The door he opened for later generations of composers was one through which Franz Liszt delightfully would have gone if he had been somewhat younger."

Five famous composers who found themselves ad odds with the political circumstances of their times produced key works of great intensity viewed here from a completely new perspective in these virtuosic arrangements for four saxophones. In Search of Freedom advocates the freedom of art, which manages to survive even in situations of limited personal liberty. For various reasons Hanns Eisler, Kurt Weill, and Erwin Schulhoff fell into disfavor under the National Sociality regime. They sympathized with the Communist Party, some of them were of Jewish background, and they composed ''degenerate music'' - which in Germany had no future. While Weill and Eisler were very successful as exiles in the United States, the former on Broadway and the latter in Hollywood, Schulhoff got caught between the fronts and died in a concentration camp. Songs from Weill's Threepenny Opera and Eisler's Suite No. 6 are heard here along with Schulhoff's Five Pieces for String Quartet, which as a suite of popular dances ranging from the waltz to the tango seems to be quite remote from teh political sphere. Arvo Part earned his place of dishonor on the index of the Soviet authorities when he turned to music of religious and meditative character. Dmitri Shostakovich's dealings with the Soviet state apparatus were very ambivalent. It continues to be debated whether even his celebratory compositions were not perhaps already intended as caricatures. The Berlage Quartet's negotiation of its abrupt alternations between heartrending lament and ecstatic rhythm make this an unforgettable album."

Like Shostakovich did, he fruitfully collaborates with prominent performing musicians. Tchaikovsky and Yuri Bashmet are known for their long standing artistic fellowship. The concerto Etudes in Simple Tones was written for a rare line-up - viola, piano and orchestra. This is an ''exercise in various styles'', a sort of an offering to the great violist of our days and, at the same time, an amicable dialogue ''on equal terms.'' The concerto was triumphantly premiered in 1993 in London. This recording features Yuri Bashmet and Boris Berezovsky, a golden winner of the International Tchaikovsky Competition and numerous awards, including the ones of BBC Music Magazine, Echo Klassik, Gramophone and Diapason d'Or. The concerto for two pianos and orchestra was written for pianist Alexander Slobodyanik, one of the leading representatives of Heinrcih Neuhaus's school, and his son. As the composer admitted, the part of the second piano was written after the concerto was finished. The composer also took part in the premiere of the concerto. Today, this concerto is successfully performed by the continuers of music dynasties, the children of Tchaikovsky and Bashmet, who have won the audience's affection at some of the world's most prestigious venues."

These and similar quotes are the reactions of well-known magazines to this exceptional jazz trio, containing Bernhard Schuler, Stephan Emig and Matthias Akeo Nowak. Since its founding in 1999, triosence can be proud of an impressive trophy cabinet, from first prize at ''Jugend jazzt'' to various cultural and compositional awards, with a best new entry in the international jazz charts in Germany extending their portfolio. In their tour schedule, alongside concerts in Germany and tours in the USA, are trips to Japan, Taiwan, Malaysia, Spain, and many others.

His enthusiasm for the freedom of jazz grew equally alongside his autodidactic study of the instrument. Learning the increasingly demanding playing techniques which that kind of music requires was a unique incentive for Reinfeld, and brought him an increasing sense of self-fulfillment.

Giardini decided to pursue a solo career, he traveled to Europe and after the great successes during the concerts held in Berlin and France, he settled in England, where he remained for more than forty years, supported by the relevant protection families of London. He was Italian opera director throughout his stay in London. And it is just in London that Felice Giardini gives birth to the 6 Concerts of the 15th Opera for Violin and Orchestra presented in this prestigious case.

""The entire work is not only one of his most mature chamber works, but constitutes an unsurpassed achievement of its genre"" (Herman Abert). Just as in the field of baroque music, music from the classical period is now being recorded more often on ""original instruments"".

The document states that he was ''approximately 22'' when his father Angelo died. He took charge of the entire family, including his mother Francesca Redesi, and his seven siblings. We have no information regarding migali's musical education - documents or other information that could shed light on this period of his life have not been uncovered. This collection of sonatas attests to Migali's high level of compositional skill, a unique case in the musical scene of the late seventeenth-century Apulia. It is unlikely that his musical education was limited to his native city - it almost certainly extended to Naples or more probably to Rome. His ''lucrative profession as Maestro di Cappella and Music Composer'' is confirmed by his only surviving printed work. We have no information regarding other compositions of manuscripts. The collection of Trio Sonatas was published in Rome in 1969, when the composer was roughly 61; it is the work of a mature musician with considerable knowledge of the ''Roman'' style of the late seventeenth century. Assuming Migali was in Rome when he was around 23 (in approximately 1655) a meeting with Corelli would have been unlikely, as the presence of the latter in the Eternal City can be attested starting in 1675; moreover, at that time the 40-year-old Migali would have already been well known and established. In recent years, musicologists have identified and defined a Roman style of instrumental music, with Corelli as its most notable representative. Violinist Enrico Gatti comments that ''Corelli introduced a new formal model, which wa spure, balanced, and full of musical substance; at the same time he pursued the Roman style, endorsing and incorporating the significant inventions of his illustrious predecessors, among whom Alessandro Stradella''. Migali's works could belong to the ''Roman style'', though his idea is not supported by any evidence."

The recording embodies the definition of its title - Argot, whcih means teh language of a particular group in two meaningful ways. First, Mathieu has selected a unique array of violin-centric works that illuminate the creative strengths of twentieth century modernist composers. Second, as a result of the album's daring program and Mathieu's incredible talents, listeners enjoy the opportunity to hear every nuance of the violin's expressive vocabulary executed at the highest possible level. Argot focuses on compositions by three titans of twentieth century european modernism: Franco Donatoni, Pierre Boulez, and Witold Lutoslawski. Donatoni's Argo: Due pezzi per violono not only gives the album its title, but also serves as one of two solo violin works on the album, alongside Boulez's Anthemes 1 pour violon seul. These pieces reveal the depths of Mathieu's virtuosity, as she delivers deeply human and emotive performances of these notably technical and demanding works. In Mathieu's rendering of these compositions, every corner of the violin's sound world is both exploited and imbued with significance. Some might think that any piece written for solo instrument must be limited in what it can express, but, with that instrument in Mathieu's hands, this theory is thoroughly disapproved as neither Donatoni nor Boulez's compositions submit to its tenets. On the contrary, Mathieu's expert performances turn these works' intricate gestures and motives into the foundation of compelling musical narratives with which the listener cannot help but become enchanted."

As the album's title suggests, the group of composers Piffaro features can be seen as the precedent for the luminaries of the German baroque era, specifically Johann Sebastian Bach. With Back before Bach simultaneously drawing from a wide variety of genres, yet also focusing on a geographically and temporarily limited group of composers, Piffaro succeeds wildly in presenting the musical foundation from which Bach and his contemporaries emerged. Piffaro specializes in historical performance, and they bring a multidimensional approach to the works on this album. First, Piffaro showcases at least a half dozen different types of Renaissance-era instruments on Back Before Bach, from shawms and dulcians to sackbuts, as well as recorders, krumhorns and bagpipes. Second, each set of pieces is arranged differently, sometimes homogenously but more often heterogeneously, featuring a mixture of the instruments described above. This flexible instrumentation is representative of consort-style performance, which defined instrumental music in the sixteenth century. This is one way Back Before Bach is a persuasive time capsule; the other lies in the album's programming, which illustrates many of the important trends in the era's sacred and secular music. Consider the album's dance pieces, for instance, especially Michael Praetorius' ''Volta.'' Piffaro's performance transports us to a noble court and through its driving rhythms and percussion accompaniment beckons us to dance. It is also particularly noteworthy that Piffaro includes a set of German popular songs on the album. Vernacular music from this period was rarely written down and, as a result, tends, unfairly to be lost to history. The inclusion of these popular tunes is a rare and special treat for those who listen to Back Before Bach and adds valuable detail to Piffaro's depiction of the musical world of sixteenth century Germany."

Composing in a tonal idiom reminiscen tof the great melodists of the early 20th century, Kurek creates music that tugs at the heartstrings without ever pandering, that is rich in emotive content without feeling surgary. The works on The Sea Knows plumb the depths of musical sensitivity and will appeal to anyone who listens to music seeking intimacy and an emotionally-grounded experience. In today's contemporary musical world, composers are often all too aware that a piece may be premiered and then performed again rarely, if ever. These pieces seem likely to defy that cruel cycle. Thoroughly ''road-tested,'' and listener-approved, teh works making up The Sea Knows have been performed before many audiences and seem likely to be enjoyed by many more to come. The expansive opening Serenade for Violoncello and Harp is constituted by a single sweeping movement. Melodic materials presented by the cello are built around the expansion of two central themes. These themes, described by the composer as ''simple,'' are explored and transformed until they become anyting but. This melodic transformation, rendered here by Ovidiu Marinescu, exists atop a virtuosic harp tapestry of harmonic filigree admirably played by Rita Costanzi. Also featuring cellist Ovidiu Marinescu, a Parma labelmate, the album title track is a tour de force for cello soloist and string orchestra. The work unfolds in sonata form and was written as a programmatic depiction of a poem of the same name written by the composer. In both music and poem, vastness is a central theme, and the emotive lines played by the cello sometimes crash against the waves of the orchestra and sometimes allow the musical tides to pull them along."

Featuring fantastic ensembles, and with works that reference far-flung locations and historical events, this album journeys fascinatingly through time and space as it compiles a competitively selected sample of today's best compositions. One of the joys of Ascend is the variety, which emerges from the album's aim to include the music of as many composers as possible. Listeners can look forward to a range of vocal and instrumental chamber works featuring instrumentations from solo clarinet to a large ensemble of strings, piano, and solo oboe. And, even though Ascend is a showcase of composers, the album's performances are spectacular, and feature some of teh world's leading soloists and ensembles; namely, the famed Jack Quartet, which is broadly considered one of, if not, the best string quartets with a contemporary music focus in the United States. Renowned for their joyous embrace of the most intense aspects of avant garde aesthetics, the work Jack performs - Joungmin Lee's Vexatious - is one of the most vibrant on the album. Thriving at the extremities of the string quartet's sonic language, Vexatious is a visceral and dramatic composition given an outstanding an dastounding performance on Ascend. Other remarkable works include Patrick Houlahin's snoqualmie Passages, for piano and alto saxophone, Paul SanGregory's Shining Through Cracks, for oboe and ensemble, and Aaron Alon's stunning art song, Dulce Et Decorum Est. All three share tremendous melodic writing and storytelling through the conversation of melody and accompaniment. Certainly, this characteristic comes across most clearly and compellingly in Alon's Dulce Et Decorum Est, a setting of Wilfred Owen's poem of the same name illustrating the attrition and terrors faced by infantry in World War One. Scored for baritone and string quartet, Alon's music is both heartbreakingly beautiful and intensely variegated, conveying the gritty detail of the text along with the innocence and sentimentality of the soldiers it depicts, men who left home with the hope of seizing glory only to find the filth and horror of trench warfare."

Several of these beautiful and moving settings of profound and poignant texts feature intricate ''polychoral'' techniques: multi-part, multi-divisi, solo, echo and spatial effects. Many of Little's choral works are designed to be performed cori spezzati - a technique with which different sections of the choir are arranged above and around the audience, adding another dimension to the listening experience.

This would put an end to all controversy, war and fear, and establish peace via social contract. Over the course of the book Hobbes targets Christianity and contemporary philosophic methods, rejecting the idea of spirits and souls, and arguing for a philosophy to end divisiveness and provide indisputable conclusions. These highly controversial theses led to book burnings in 1666 and Hobbes being dubbed the ''Monster of Malmsbury""."

Her music often creates implicit links to apssages from great literature by including literary quotes in her scores that encode the performer's perception and interpretation withe xtra-musical reference points. In her solo clarinet work, Solitarius, we hear whispered fragments of text occasionally woven into the fabric of the performance itself, a window into the unspoken literary source that informs its interpretation. The work unfolds otherwise as a thoughtful soliloquy, a rhetorical dialogue with different sides of oneself. Ventus is timbrally more exploratory, as fluttering extended techniques in the saxophone merge with unstable sounds in the electronics. The chamber orchestra piece Grues et nix revels in dense sound masses and long, sustained lines, creating crestling waves of evocative and expressive harmony. FCH, an homage to Frederic Chopin, begins with an exploration of sparse lyricism before evoking its dedicatee through pianistic passagework. The solo guitar work Primo cum lumine solis also remains within a conventional harmonic frame for the mos tpart, melding the free, rhetorical dialogue of Solitarius with modeal treatment. The final section of the piece breaks away from the prevailing lyricism with some angular passagework before the final cadence brings back the expansive character of the opening section. The final work on the program, Idem non semper idem, returns to the fragility of the extended techniques of teh solo saxophone, with unearthly multiphonics serving as architectural pillars for this strange and tactile sonic language. Dalia R. With's expressive palette is driven by an internal muse. At her disposal is a strong command over experimental instrumental technique as well as a penchant for beautiful expressive melancholy. Connecting the diverse expressive worlds she inhabits is a solemn, lyrical quality tha tpierces through varied textures."

The gravitas of this raga tests the very limits of any master vocalist. Darbari stands at the very pinnacle of the repertoire. It is derived from the ancient South Indian raga Kanada, which uses the same notes as teh natural minor scale, and is therefore often referred to as Darbari Kanada. It creates a sense of spiritual awakening that arises from the unique collection of melodic contours and ornaments that blossom in performance. The profound emotions of Darbari are flawlessly evoked in this recording by Mashkoor Ali Khan, or Khan Sahib as we respectfully call him. The raga is not necessarily somber, however, and can be joyful as portrayed in the drut bandish which deals with anticipation and reunion. Khan Sahib and the great vocalists of his lineage, the Kirana gharana, shine in their renditions of deep and emotional ragas which unfold over a slow tempo and are well suited to an extended barhat (development of raga). This provides a vehicle for them to display their mastery of the raga, meticulously delineating each note in a myriad of ways, and working around the musical polarities of the vadi and samvadi (the principal and main supporting notes). For these reasons Darbari remains one of the much-favored ragas within the Kirana gharana."

He also composed movements for several sonatas which he left unfinished. Sonata in A minor D. 784 is one of the most important singular works in Schubert's output that stays apart from his previous and later sonatas. It is an austere, almost minimalistic work that achieves a profound and lasting impact. It is one of the darkest and most unsettling pieces he ever wrote and one of the most confessional. This relatively short sonata, by Schubert's standards, is one of the most authentic, prophetic and enigmatic works ever written. Sonata in A major D. 959 was writte in 1828, the last year of Schubert's life, very rapidly alongside the sonatas in C minor and B-flat major, just a few month before his death. The speed, quality and quantity of Schubert's output in the last year of his life are a marvel. In his last year, Schubert wrote some of the most important work that sums up his ideas, inspiration and ambitious as a composer. These incredible works were written by the artist at the peak of his creative powers with clarity and precision. In these works, including the last three sonatas, Schubert points the ways to resolving the perennial conflicts of existence: his final message seems to be that of acceptance and reconciliation. Towards the end of his life, Schubert was learning to accept death as a promise, as a blessing."

Bartók’s at times breezily energetic Concerto for Orchestra was an instant hit on its premiere given by the Boston Symphony Orchestra in 1944 and it has remained popular ever since. It’s a compelling work, bursting with Central European folk melodies, North African rhythms, shimmering harmonies and vivid orchestration that culminates in a strident final movement guaranteed to bring the house down. In a darker vein, Bartók’s earlier Music for Strings, Percussion and Celesta is a powerful and eerily atmospheric work which has been used in film soundtracks to great effect, notably in Stanley Kubrick’s The Shining. Rafael Kubelik recorded the Concerto for Orchestra several times throughout his career but it was this 1974 recording with the Boston Symphony Orchestra that has been singled out for especial praise, Gramophone magazine commending Kubelik’s “sheer animal excitement and biting intensity ... with the rhythms pointed to bring out the wit, above all the peasant-like jollity … This is a performance to keep making you smile with delight.” Although recorded in multi-channel sound, these memorable performances have previously been available only in the conventional two-channel stereo format.

Richly lyrical, poignant and soul searching, Mahler’s orchestral songs deal with the familiar themes of love, life, resignation and loss, exquisitely realised on an orchestral canvas which combines haunting and compelling sonorities with strident, unsettling dissonances. While not as ambitious as his symphonies, they are as deeply-felt and often regarded as the key to the larger-scale works. The eloquent sadness of the Kindertotenlieder is expressed though the rather bare orchestration and the entrancing use of solo instruments, culminating in a blissfully serene conclusion. With Lieder eines fahrenden Gesellen, the restless mood swings are matched with fluctuating, vividly textured orchestral colours. And for the most lyrical song cycle, the Rückert-Lieder, the delicately woven orchestral textures are ravishing in their effect, especially in the incomparable Ich bin der Welt abhanden gekommen, a song of which Mahler said “It is truly me”. “What makes Albrecht’s Mahler so unique? His approach has integrity, is intelligent and sensitive … Albrecht leads the Mahler that makes you love Mahler.” (NRC Handelsblad). Marc Albrecht is Music Director of the Netherlands Philharmonic, the Netherlands Chamber Orchestra and the Dutch National Opera. Acclaimed for his interpretations of Wagner, Strauss and Mahler, as well as for his commitment to contemporary music, Albrecht is a regular guest at Europe’s most prestigious opera houses and orchestras. The world renowned mezzo-soprano Alice Coote is acclaimed for her performances of Strauss, Mahler, Berlioz, Mozart, Handel and Bach; she performs throughout the UK, Europe and the US and has a busy recital schedule. The Guardian noted “Alice Coote's many admirers will be grateful to have her performance in Mahler’s great song-symphony documented in a carefully made studio recording [for PENTATONE], for she has emerged over the past few years as one of the finest mezzo interpreters of Das Lied von der Erde around … exquisitely coloured; every word matters, and the sadness that pervades the mezzo songs in particular is conveyed without it ever becoming self-conscious or sentimental.”"

With this new release from PENTATONE, he brings the same sense of awe and wonder to the music of Bach in a series of riveting performances, including the achingly beautiful solo cantata Ich habe genug and the ever-popular Orchestral Suite No. 2. The programme also contains Alfeyev’s breath-taking arrangements of Bach’s organ masterpieces Ich ruf’ zu Dir, Herr Jesu Christ and the colossal Passacaglia and Fugue in C minor. Bach’s deceptively simple choral prelude, the plaintive Ich ruf’ zu Dir, Herr Jesu Christ, BWV 639 is a masterpiece of humility and restraint. In Alfeyev’s masterly arrangement, the voice of the supplicant is moved between different sections of the orchestra, underscoring the universality of the prayer. Bach’s most famous solo cantata, the haunting Ich habe genug, BWV 82, radiates a profound sense of resignation with its gentle swaying rhythms and exquisite writing for solo oboe; its central aria, Schlummert ein, ihr matten Augen, is an oasis of calm and transcendence with its warmly uplifting bass solo. In a somewhat lighter vein, Bach revels in his mastery of the French style in his Orchestral Suite No. 2 in B minor, BWV 1067, an irresistible collection of dances – both aristocratic and popular – which closes with a mischievous Badinerie. Resplendent with orchestral colour and powerful, full-throated brass, Alfeyev’s arrangement for full orchestra of the mighty Passacaglia and Fugue in C minor BWV 582 for organ is an enthralling conclusion to a compelling programme. “Bach’s music is not a museum piece. Living in modern times, we have full rights to use the full scale of modern means of expression in order to translate to the listener the outstanding grandeur and timeless beauty of his music.” (Metropolitan Hilarion Alfeyev)"

The work was premiered at the Semperoper in 1911- and was an immediate sensation. The dress rehearsal alone received more comprehensive press coverage than the Kaiser’s birthday on the same day, with reporters racing to wire the wonderful success to their papers. The Deutsche Reichsbahn scheduled special trains to bring ardent musiclovers from other places to the city on the Elbe. There was perhaps a feeling that it would be the last European operatic event before the First World War broke out… Not least the work itself contributed to the nostalgic fin-de-siecle atmosphere. Strauss and his librettist Hugo von Hofmannsthal had written a “comedy for music” in which the Rococo era of Maria Theresia’s Vienna was revived- not for historical reasons, but as a reflection on their own apocalyptic mood. Everything seems so genuine in this piece and yet it is all an illusion. From the solemn presentation of the rose (a Hofmannsthal invention) to the Viennese waltz mania, it is a musical anachronism- which makes its timelessness all too clear. The work was premiered in January 1911, not in Vienna, but in opera-loving Dresden, where Strauss’s “personal conductor” general music director Ernst von Schuch conducted the Dresden Hofkapelle (today’s Staatskapelle), which Strauss deemed to be “the best opera orchestra in the world.” The Staatskapelle musicians still play their idol’s work from the original orchestral parts of the premiere."

One such is the two-movement version of the Piano Sonata no. 6 in E minor D566. The Moscow live recording from 1958 also shows that Richter is one of the very few pianists of note to have played both versions, the other being in three movements. That also applies to the shortened (Urtext) and full (ed. Brahms) versions of Impromptu no. 1 D946 and the largely unknown original version of the third Impromptu of D899 (in G major) and the popular version in G flat. Then there is the never officially published recording of the unfinished Sonata no. 15 D840, nicknamed “Reliquie” in the mistaken belief that it was Schubert’s last sonata. Schubert was a true lieder composer, and his piano works too have a song-like character. This Edition accordingly includes Sviatoslav Richter “accompanying” at the piano. The six Schubert songs recorded in 1953 and sung- in Russian- by his lifelong companion the soprano Nina Dorliac are a genuine rarity.

The year 2017 marks the centenary of Lipatti’s birth, and at the same time the 67th anniversary of his death- and the fascination of Lipatti is appreciated more than ever.

At the same time, he wanted to continue the natural process of combining large-scale works with shorter pieces (or sets of pieces) in a way which migh tmirror a concert programme. Therefore he has chosen one of Sibelius's most important large-scale piano works, the Sonata in F major, Op. 12, as well as one of his best-loved orchestral transcriptions, Valse triste.

Featuring acoustic instruments and responsive electronic materials the album offers a degree of variety in timbre and musical content that is sometimes lacking in electronic music. In Lyra, the album's opening track, Belet establishes an aural world in which the organic material and electronic content merge seamlessly, clearly defining the musical language to come as the album progresses. A sense of musical humor and clear intent runs throughout Belet's work, and one quickly concludes that the composer, while wonderfully fluent and virtuosic in his chosen medium, is not at all above poking fun at tradition. Name Droppings, assembled from fragments of spoken text, is crafted solely using quotations from program notes and biographies the composer encountered while attending concerts. The resulting piece, with narrative thrusts provided by unexpected textual content, succeeds as both a strong composition and humorous commentary on the concertgoing experience. While Belet proves adept throughout this release at crafting strongly evocative electronic materials, his writing for acoustic instruments also shines through in the works tha tdraw from mixed disciplines. In various pieces, strings, brass, and the piano all interact with electronic materials, often leading to shimmering textual content. By often utlizing responsive electronics and real time controls, as in Radiance and Still Harmless [Bass]ically, Belet allows for the ''performance'' element to remain a crucial, and often defining aspect, of these selections. Still Harmless [Bass]ically presents the electric bass in an electronic environment for which it is aptly sutied. Harmonics and wide-ranging bass flourishes weave in and out of responsive electronic surroundings, creating an atmospheric palette that is at once intriguing and impressively emotive."

Recorded by Reference's Grammy-winning engineer 'Prof.' Keith O. Johnson at Skywalker Sound in Marin County, California, Break The Chain brings twelve new MacLeod originals. Each song is extremely personal and at the same time, universal; covering subjects topical, humorous and soulful; from the satirical to the sublime. The title work, Break The Chains, composed and performed with his son Jesse, focuses on breaking the cycle of family violence and abuse. A powerful concern all too many are familiar with, Doug and Jesse confront this pervasive issue directly and personally, bringing it out of the shadows. Together, they share the healing, reconciliation and peace available to all who work to prevent the cycle from repeating and to Break The Chain. The album is co-produced by Doug Macleod and Janice Mancuso. Bassist Denny Croy, drummer Jimi Bott and percussionist Oliver Brown join Doug in duo, trio and quartet settings. Like all ''Prof.'' Johnson's sessions, Break The Chain was recorded live, in real time, with no overdubs or effects. A prolific singer, songwriter, engaging storyteller, and masterful guitarist, Doug is a perennial Blues Music Award nominee and multiple Blues Music Award winner including Acoustic Artist of The Year and Acoustic Album of the Year.

Retrieval is one of the finest examples of a record label offering some historical rereleases. For this release the label collected music by Irving Mills and his Hotsy Totsy Gang as recorded in 1928 and 1929. Irving Mills was a jazz music publisher, also known by the name of Joe Primrose. He owned Mills Music with his brother Jack between 1919-1965. When they sold Mills Music, they had become the largest independent music publisher in the world. Besides music publisher, Irving was also a singer, lyricist, songwriter, A&R man and manager of several bands that included Cab Calloway, Benny Carter, Fletcher Henderson, Mills Blue Rhythm Band and the Duke Ellington Orchestra, which he managed from 1926 to 1939. Although not a musician himself, Irving decided to put together his own studio recording group. His Irving Mills and his Hotsy Totsy Gang had as sidemen a.o. Tommy Dorsey, Jimmy Dorsey, Joe Venuti, Eddie Lang, Arnold Brillhardt, Arthur Schutt, and Manny Klein. Other variations of his bands featured Glenn Miller, Benny Goodman, and Red Nichols. One of his innovations was the “band within a band.” He started this in 1928 by arranging for members of Ben Pollack’s band to record hot small group sides for the various dime store labels, out of the main orchestra and printing “small orchestrations” transcribed off the record, so that non-professional musicians could see how great solos were constructed. The Hotsy Totsy Gang recordings, done between 1928 and 1930, assembled some of the greatest white Jazz musicians of the era of often produced spectacular results. Sometimes Mills sang on the records, other times he just arranged the record dates and selected the musicians. Many of these recordings were “so hot that the music had to be written on sheets of asbestos!”"

Rising star, Fabio Menchetti, captures every facet in these finely crafted performances. This release was praised by Gramophone, Musical Opinion, The Classical Reviewer and Pizzicato. Steps is a large-scale cycle of music for solo piano. Begun in 2001, it now runs to five volumes and is a project which the composer, by his own admission, anticipates running through his life, as a kind of “companion.” It is significant in Seabourne’s oeuvre not only for its scale, but because piano music was the medium which drew Seabourne back into composer after a 12-year silence. In terms of style, all the works in the volumes are extremely varied and idiosyncratic, with much rhythmic and melodic interest, often very lyrical though not necessarily “tuneful.” Seabourne employs a colorful and piquant harmonic palette which recalls Debussy, Janacek and Messiaen, while the rhythmic vitality of the music is akin to Prokofiev; indeed the brevity and aphoristic nature of the pieces aligns them with Prokofiev’s “Visions Fugitives” and “Sarcasms.” The works are challenging, and probably best tackled by the advanced pianist who enjoys such technical challenges as varied time signatures, polyrhythms, myriad articulation, filigree textures and one with the requisite artistic sensitivity and imagination to bring musical color and invention to the music."

Boyd Meets Girl has toured throughout the USA, Australia, India and Nepal, including appearances at the Newport Music Festival (Rhode Island), the Gharana Music Festival (Kathmandu, Nepal) and the Monsoon Music Festival (Kolkata, India). The duo writes of this release: “Our debut album is a lovingly curated musical journey, encompassing both our shared perspective on beloved works and relatively unknown repertoire we believe is equally deserving of attention. This album features our own arrangements, including a reduction of Faure's adored Pavane from its orchestral original, and Bach's solo keyboard inventions re-imagined on cello and guitar. These are presented alongside contemporary works, including a colorful three-movement piece by Bolivian composer Jaime Zenamon, and the debut recording of Arafura Arioso by esteemed Australian composer Ross Edwards. The entire album is designed to highlight the range and of timbral possibilities of this under-explored instrumental pairing. Our collaboration began as a romantic relationship in 2012. We are now happily married and live in New York City.”"

With this release, the vast majority of Dorfmann's RCA recordings are reissued on 8 CDs for the first time, transferred, mixed and mastered from the original analogue master discs and tapes, using updated technology. These include long, sought-after rarities such as her rare 1939 rendition of the ''Choral Fantasy'' with Arturo Toscanini, Beethoven's ''Moonlight'' and ''Pathetique'' Sonatas, concertos by Grieg and Mendelssohn, works of Schumann, Chopin and Tchaikovsky, and one of the first complete editions of Mendelssohn's Songs Without Words. Apparently Dorfmann was teh first female piano soloist to collaborate with Arturo Toscanini, and their historic 1945 studio recording of Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 1 marked the start of the pianist's relationship with RCA.DISC 1Beethoven: Piano Concerto No. 1 in C Major, Op. 15 NBC Symphony Orchestra, Arturo ToscaniniBeethoven: Fantasia for Piano, Chorus, and Orchestra, Op. 80 ""Choral Fantasy""  NBC Symphony Orchestra, Arturo Toscanini (1939)Liszt: 3 Études de concert, S.144: No. 3 ""Un Sospiro"" (1947)Schumann: AufschwungSchumann: Fantasiestücke, Op. 12Beethoven: 6 Ecossaises for Piano, WoO 83Mendelssohn: Rondo Capriccioso, Op. 14 (1947) DISC 2Beethoven: Piano Sonata No. 14 in C-Sharp Minor, Op. 27, No. 2 ""Moonlight""Beethoven: Sonata No. 8 in C Minor, Op. 13 ""Pathétique"" DISC 3Chopin: Waltz No. 1 in E-flat Major, Op. 18 ""Grande valse brillante""Chopin: Waltz in A-flat Major, Op. 69, No. 1 ""L'Adieu""Chopin: Waltz in D-flat Major, Op. 64, No. 1 ""Minute""Chopin: Waltz in A-flat Major, Op. 64, No. 3Chopin: Waltz in G-flat Major, Op. 70, No. 1Chopin: Waltz in F Minor, Op. 70, No. 2Chopin: Waltz in A-flat Major, Op. 42, ""Grande valse""Chopin: Waltz in B Minor, Op. 69, No. 2Chopin: Waltz in F Major, Op. 34, No. 3Chopin: Waltz in A Minor, Op. 34, No. 2Chopin: Waltz in A-flat Major, Op. 34, No. 1 ""Valse brillante""Chopin: Waltz in C-sharp Minor, Op. 64, No. 2Chopin: Waltz in D-flat Major, Op. 70, No. 3Chopin: Waltz in E Minor, Op. posth. DISC 4Grieg: Piano Concerto in A Minor, Op. 16  The Robin Hood Dell Orchestra Of Philadelphia, Erich LeinsdorfMendelssohn: Piano Concerto No. 1 in G Minor, Op. 25  The Robin Hood Dell Orchestra Of Philadelphia, Erich Leinsdorf DISC 5Schumann: Papillions, Op. 2Mendelssohn: Andante and Rondo Capriccioso, Op. 14 (1953)Mendelssohn: Songs without Words Book 5, Op. 62, No. 1: Andante espressivo in G major ""May Breezes"" (1953)Mendelssohn: Songs without Words Book 6, Op. 67, No. 4: Presto in C Major ""Spinner's Song"" (1953)Chopin: 3 Ecossaises, Op. 72, No. 3Liszt: 3 Études de concert, S.144: No. 3 ""Un Sospiro"" (1953)Ravel: SonatineMenotti: Ricercare and Toccata on a Theme from ""The Old Maid and the Thief"" DISC 6Tchaikovsky: Between Birthdays, Op. 39 (Children's Album)Schumann: Album for the Young, Op. 68Tchaikovsky: The Seasons, Op. 37a (first release of II.

Six of the latter are represented on this album - the early ''Adrast'' written around the age of twenty, and ''Fierebras'' written in 1823, five years before the sudden end of his short life. Schubert made many attempts to achieve success on the Viennese operatic stage but was singularly unlucky in doing so. Consequently none of his operatic music ever entered the repertoire and today it remains the most unknown aspect of his work. Therefore this album is an assembly of some very rare music indeed, most of which has never before been recorded. Indeed, most of these operas and singspiels have never been professionally mounted since they were written. For this album, German tenor Daniel Behle travelled to Austria and worked alongside the L'Orfeo Baroque Orchestra, conducted by Michi Gaigg."

He also worked with the Komische Oper of East Berlin. From 1970 to 1996 he was teh Kapellmeister of the famous Gewandhausorchester Leipzig. In 1991, Masur became music director of the New York Philharmonic Orchestra. From 2002 to 2008, Masur was music director of the Orchestre National de France. On his 80th birthday, Masur conducted musicians from both these orchestras at a Proms concert in London, conducting music by Tchaikovsky and Bruckner. The beginnings of the orchestra go back to 1743, when a society called the Grosses Concert began performing in private homes. The orchestra gave its first concert in the Gewandhaus in 1781. It is the oldest orchestra in Germany, apart for private orchestras. In 1835, the great composer Felix Mendelssohn became the orchestra's main conductor. He was called the Gewandhauskapellmeister. He kept this position, apart from one year, until his death in 1847. In 1885, the orchestra moved into a new hall which was given the same name. The present Gewandhaus is the third building with the name.

Includes printed inner sleeve with new liner notes.Comprised of guitarist Lee Baker, drummer Phillip Durham, bassist Steve Spear, organist Fred Nicholson and vocalist Gene Wilkins, Moloch was a lynchpin of the Memphis psychedelic scene of the late '60s. Boasting a bluesy sound akin to the Grateful Dead with Midtown substituting for the Haight, Moloch’s self-titled album is an outlier in the Stax catalog for its combination of rock, hard blues, psychedelic acid-washed guitar solos, and blue-eyed soul. As one reviewer states, “it’s the Jimi Hendrix Experience meets the Box Tops with a little Furry Lewis thrown in for good measure... a prime example of the wildly eclectic stuff coming out of Stax, Ardent, Sam Phillips’ and American Studios in Memphis in the late sixties and early seventies.” Also of note is that this eponymous release contains the original recorded version of the Don Nix-penned standard ""Going Down,"" which would go on to be covered by Freddie King, Jeff Beck, Deep Purple, JJ Cale, Bryan Ferry, Pearl Jam, Gov't Mule, Sam Kinison, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Joe Satriani, the Who, Led Zeppelin, and Sammy Hagar among others.KEY MARKETING DRIVERS: First-ever 180-gram vinyl reissue and the first U.S. release since the original 1971Lacquers cut at Ardent studios in Memphis from the original Stax latheVinyl pressed at Memphis Record PressingBrand new liner notes by author, historian, and award-wiining music critic BobMehrTitle will be promoted across Stax socials, hitting over 100K fans.Part of the 2017 ""Made in Memphis"" campaign, which will highlight underrepresented stories from the Stax familyKey release in 2017’s Stax 60th Anniversary CampaignSupport from key players in the Stax communityPress campaignTrack Listing:A1.

On the question who she liked to sing with, she immediately answered Rolf Bjorling. ''He was a top singer who you really could trust'', she said. ''He had the same timbre and body form as his father Jussi. Gedda was more distant, not just as loving on the stage as Rolf, but Gedda had a wonderful sense of humor.'' With Gedda she sang Tosca in Savonlinna under Sixten Ehrling. When Laila sang her last performance at the Stockholm Opera in the role as Elektra, on the 4th of May, 1996, the role list was decorated with a colored photo with the singer and a hundred of piano reductions. They contained the hundred roles that Laila sang in the Stockholm Opera during her 32 years as an employee. A most unusual record. Now Laila has also written her memoirs. She tells about her long, variable and successful career, but also difficult ordeals in her private life, for instance the stroke she suffered in 2003, and how to survive even if you are severely harrowed."

The verses and stanzas expand and contract in an attempt to anchor each moment of the story to the more consistent sound in a continuous recourse of sense and nonsense of the word, word which tends to dissolve and then emerge again almost redounding. A poetic fairy tale that does not end and that instead opens up new fairy tales and new sounds, the enigmatic and crystalline vibration of the word itself. Berdondini's poem brings together the compositions of ten musicians who combine ten distinct flute pieces with each single Fabula ut tale."

While the old one fights to survive, the new one fights for its birth - this struggle for existence has been lasting for centuries. Rules are introduced, sometimes they become crystalized, sometimes they are rejected. As a result, music is like a living organism that is filtered and refined while being added to and improved as each era passes. This album is the result of my personal struggle between old and new, between past and future, for nowadays music is written by computers but musical rules remain the same as those written centuries ago. Since Vito Lo Re has always had an innate inclination to compose music associated with images, he often asks ''what is 35mm?''. It could be called a musical library of different moods and feelings, but even this definition would be especially limiting. Instead, he would argue that 35mm is his very heartfelt tribute to cinema and my declaration of love for the Seventh Art."

However, Richter never gave up his traditional baroque ''craftsmanship'' and after making himself acquainted with the most successful oratorio libretto by G.C. Pasquini, he set it to music entirely within the boundaries of his characteristic style, combining baroque composition principles with the achievements of the nascent classicist style. For this he used the new 1744 version of the lbiretto intended fo J.A. Hasse. La Deposizione, Richter's only Italian oratorio is a Good Friday pondering of Jesus's disciples over God's unconditional love and Christ's suffering on the cross. For the first time it was performed on the Good Friday of 1748 in the Mannheim court church of The Visitation of Our Lady. After the Strassbourg Requiem, this premiere recording is another gemstone that the Czech Ensemble Baroque have added to the mosaic of Richter's remarkable, still little-researched oeuvre."

And so something gradually evolved that can justifiably be described as his life's work. But what does a life's work mean for us today? An immense number of sonatas, 555 in total. Their grandiose diversity and originality are only actually unlocked when, instead of consuming them ne masse, you listen to just one a week. However you should then listen to this one sonata every day, just as Scarlatti originally intended. And in one fell swoop, your life is over! Can we really do them justice today? In view of this, mine and Christoph Ullrich's undertaking to stretch the production over 17 years seems appropriate. Besides this, at the same time, Christoph Ullrich is still working on other lifelong projects, such as his large-scale children's project Laterna Musica (formerly Earworm). And so with our altered perception of time, we're battling to revive the past whilst remaining modern and curious in order ot meet today's demands. But the battle is worth it! What an adventure! Because who knows what'll come out of it after 17 years? What will the fingers and ears end up doing? Will there still be music at the end of it all? In all of his playfulness, craziness and childishness, in his cacophony of hand-crossing and sensuality, this cycle can also offer something very special compared to so many others: the realization that doing more and more and doing it faster doesn't actually help.

His great ability as an engraver allowed him to compete with no one but Ottaviano Petrucci - the undisputed prince of musical printers - and his soul as a ‘cultural entrepreneur’ led him to the courageous and pioneering operation of proposing the intavolatura (the reduction of Vocal or instrumental polyphonic compositions) for the keyboard, instead of the lute as it was in vogue at the time. For the recording of the “Frottole Intabulate” (the frottola is the most popular Italian folk song in use between the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries), Maria Luisa Baldassari takes advantage of performing original period instruments: the spinetta, the spinetta Harpsichord, clavichord, the rare and archaic “clavisimbalum”, and the magnificent 1533 Vincenzo Colombi organ of the Chiesa del SS.

A native of Tuscany, he first moved to the Austrian court where he started his career as composer, then, as virtuoso violinist, to Messina at the time the thriving Sicilian city was distinguished for its avant-garde cultural activity. Here Pandolfi composed the collection of songs presented in this release, all dedicated to Sicilian princes and musicians, including a singer that would later be murdered by the composer in unclear circumstances. He finally ran away from Messina taking service at the Spanish court where he presumably remained until his death. Most of these compositions are brilliantly characterized by the Messina seventeenth-century sounds and instruments (i.e. scacciapensieri, triangle, triple flute, castagnette and tambourine) enriching the performances with the vitality that characterized popular dances and Spanish musical influences mixed with cultured forms of music (especially by the Roman school) on which the official institutions in the city were based."

So Scelsi became the interpreter of a new concept of sound that transcends the formal architecture almost renouncing to making music, becoming a link between the earthly world and cosmic forces. The result is music demanding great sensitivity and particular mood by both the performer and the listener, to whom is requested a total and religious immersion in the sound and vibrations of the world of Giacinto Scelsi. Rossella Spinosa holds degrees in piano, harpsichord, composition, and law. She also graduated with highest marks in Musicology.

That has yet to be explored in great details. This first instalment of the first-every survey of his piano music reveals a composer close to his Russian roots but also alive to the music of his own time. His style has much in common with Medtner and Rachmaninov, both friends from student days, but with a harmonic freedom that suggests Debussy. His inventive use of rhythm calls on folk influences from Azerbaijan, Armenia and elsewhere. This album is the first of a series of collaborations between Toccata Classics and Mexican musicians. The Mexican pianist Rodolfo Ritter is a frequent soloist with mos tof the major Mexican orchestras, performing the complete piano concertos of Bartok, Brhams, Brachmaninov, Shostakovich and Stravinsky, as well as less-well-known concertos by Martinu, Miguel Galvez-Taroncher and Xavier Scharwenka, alongside the world premieres of the Second Piano Concerto by Manuel Ponce, the Ricardo Castro Piano Concerto and the Second and Third Piano Concertos by Gonzalo Curiel, works which he has also recorded."

Featuring a wide-ranging tenor part, a virtuosic solo guitar and brilliant contributions by the instruments Schubert chose for his great Octet, this masterpiece imaginatively confronts the mannered style of the Darmstadt school. In ''lovely blueness'' the emphasis is on ''blueness'' - but not only when lovely. The Mediterranean light and the nostalgia for Greek Antiquity give this music a special place in the composer's output: to the element of euphony, of consonance in its widest sense are added grittier sounds and sharper contrasts, as befits the hymn's heavily symbolic content. - ''The idea for 'Neue Volkslieder und Hirtengesange' is closely linked to my activity as cultural animator during the Eighties in the Steiermark.

He began composing when he was only 11 years old, long before his studies at the Hochschule fur Musik in Karlsruhe where he successfully passed the state examination in composition and music theory. The current album featuring string quartets and quintets presents works from the early and late stages of his compositional oeuvre. Rihm composed the String Quartet in G minor as a 14-year-old schoolboy. The youthful work displays a close proximity to early Beethoven who at that time stood very m uch under the influence of Haydn. Stylistically, this quartet also shows many similarities to the String Quartet 1968 written a few years later. The ''Epilog'' for string quintet which forges a link with the late works of Schubert was composed 45 years later. Despite its affinity with Schubert's Romanticism, the composition is clearly contemporary in style, not least due to its advanced playing techniques. ''Geste zu Vedova'' is a homage to the Venezuelan artist Emilio Vedova (1919-2006). This music is a percussive and block-like reaction to the kinesis and energy of the artist's creative approach to his works which made such a profound impression on Rihm."

For 20th and 21st century composers wanting to leave this idea of a discussion behind, the question has been: in what other ways can one write for two violins, viola, and violoncello? Helmut Zapf’s three string quartets perfectly illustrate the stages of such a confrontation. They have appeared throughout his entire career as a composer, and can be understood as markers for different periods in his compositional output. In Zapfs first string quartet elements of an individual musical rhetoric survive and are clearly understandable as such. However, the context – the “rational conversation” – is now present in only a rudimentary fashion. The second string quartet is a logical continuation of the path already established by Zapf: the last remnants of rhetoric and conversational discourse are dispensed with. The four instruments do not act individually, but are treated as a single organism. The third string quartet has been written for the Sonar group. This composition takes up the experiences of the previous pieces and at the same time tries to connect with the tradition: a reconnection from a great and skeptical distance."

The ensemble's repertoire is seemingly inexhaustible. From adventurous arrangements of piano music to string quartet, there is nothing the musicians leave untried. They employ their instruments to bring to life a myriad of different tonal colours and musical genres. Paul Hindemith is the focus of this album: :during the 1920's, he became enchanted by the tone of the saxophone, integrating it on a number of occasions into the scores of his stage works. The ensemble clair-obscur has a special interest in his chamber music, for example the Sonata for four horns and the composition ''Frankenstein's Monstre Repertoire'' for string quartet.

His new album, curiously titled The Bug, is an eclectic, glorious celebration of different jazz vernacular, from meticulously arranged funky fusion complete with searing electric guitar, to more traditional, but still exciting jazz settings, from Weather Report and Miles to Mingus and Monk. Through each track, Donahue leads the way, with different instrumentation, lending the album a nice variety, and a spectrum of harmonic sophistication, melody and intimate expression.

Neither was published until after their composer’s death, the sonata in 1838 and Pictures in 1931, though an edited version by Rimsky-Korsakov had appeared in 1886. Neither work received real appreciation and understanding until the 20th century. Daniel Hill comments: “My criteria for selecting repertoire to record was twofold: firstly, that I would be playing music for which I held a deep respect, passion and conviction; and secondly, that they were pieces for which I felt I may be able to do some justice. “Both works, though largely disparate in nature, represent a kind of journey: in the vivid experience of Mussorgsky’s Pictures, this is somewhat overtly so; Schubert, on the other hand, takes us into a profoundly intimate and, at times, transcendental realm. “My hope in making this disc is that I may have found some of that elusive and precious connection between interpreter and composition.”"
